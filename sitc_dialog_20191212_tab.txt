CARRIE	"Once upon a time, an English journalist came to New York."
CARRIE	Elizabeth was attractive and bright.
CARRIE	Right away she hooked up with one of the city's typically eligible bachelors.
TIM	The question remains-Is this really a company we want to own?
CARRIE	"Tim was 42, a well-liked and respected investment banker who made about two million a year."
CARRIE	"They met one evening, in typical New York fashion at a gallery opening."
TIM	Like it?
TIM	"Yes, actually. I think it's quite interesting. What?"
TIM	I feel like I know you from somewhere.
TIM	Doubtful. I only just moved here from London.
TIM	London? Really? That's my all-time favorite city.
TIM	It is?
TIM	Absolutely.
CARRIE	It was love at first sight.
TIM	You know I think perhaps I have met you somewhere before.
CARRIE	For two weeks they snuggled went to romantic restaurants had wonderful sex and shared their most intimate secrets.
CARRIE	One warm spring day he took her to a town house he saw in Sunday's New York Times.
REALTOR	How 'bout if we start at the top and work our way down? There are four bedrooms upstairs. Do you have any children?
TIM	Not yet.
CARRIE	"That day, Tim popped the question."
TIM	How'd you like to have dinner with my folks Tuesday night?
TIM	I'd love to.
CARRIE	"On Tuesday, he called with some bad news."
TIM	My mother's not feeling very well.
TIM	"Well, gosh, I'm sorry."
TIM	Could we take a rain check?
TIM	Of course. Tell your mum I hope she feels better.
CARRIE	"When she hadn't heard from him for two weeks, she called."
TIM	"Tim, it's Elizabeth. That's an awfully long rain check."
CARRIE	He said he was up to his ears and that he'd call her the next day.
TIM	"He never did call, of course. Bastard."
CARRIE	she told me one day over coffee.
TIM	I don't understand.
TIM	"In England, looking at houses together would have meant something."
CARRIE	Then I realized no one had told her about the end of love in Manhattan.
CARRIE	"Welcome to the age of ""un-innocence."
CARRIE	""" No one has breakfast at Tiffany's, and no one has affairs to remember."
CARRIE	"Instead, we have breakfast at 7:00 a.m."
CARRIE	and affairs we try to forget as quickly as possible.
CARRIE	Self-protection and closing the deal are paramount.
CARRIE	Cupid has flown the co-op.
CARRIE	"How the hell did we get into this mess? There are thousands, maybe tens of thousands of women like this in the city."
CARRIE	"We all know them, and we all agree they're great."
CARRIE	They travel.
CARRIE	They pay taxes.
CARRIE	They'll spend $400 on a pair of Manolo Blahnik strappy sandals.
CARRIE	And they're alone.
CARRIE	It's like the riddle of the Sphinx.
CARRIE	Why are there so many great unmarried women and no great unmarried men? I explore these sorts of issues in my column and I have terrific sources: my friends.
PETER MASON	"When you're a young guy in your 20s, women are controlling the relationship."
PETER MASON	So by the time you're an eligible man in your 30s you feel like you're being devoured by women.
PETER MASON	"Suddenly, the guys are holding all the chips."
PETER MASON	I call it the mid-30s power flip.
CAPOTE DUNCAN	It's all about age and biology.
CAPOTE DUNCAN	"I mean, if you want to get married, it's to have kids, right? Not with someone older than 35, 'cause you have to have kids right away and that's about it."
CAPOTE DUNCAN	I think these women should just forget about marriage and have a good time.
IRANDA	I have a friend who'd always gone out with extremely sexy guys and just had a good time.
IRANDA	"One day she woke up, and she was 41."
IRANDA	She couldn't get any more dates.
IRANDA	She had a complete physical breakdown couldn't hold her job and moved back to Wisconsin to live with her mother.
IRANDA	Trust me-this is not a story that makes men feel bad.
CHARLOTTE	Most men are threatened by successful women.
CHARLOTTE	"If you want to get these guys, you have to keep your mouth shut and play by the rules."
SKIPPER	I totally believe that love conquers all.
SKIPPER	Sometimes you just have to give it a little space and that's exactly what's missing in Manhattan-the space for romance.
PETER MASON	The problem is expectations.
PETER MASON	Older women don't want to settle for what's available.
IRANDA	"By the time you reach your mid-30s you think, ""Why should I settle?"" You know?"
CHARLOTTE	"It's like the older we get, the more we keep self-selecting down to a smaller and smaller group."
CAPOTE DUNCAN	What women really want is Alec Baldwin.
PETER MASON	There's not one woman in New York who hasn't turned down 10 wonderful guys because they were too short or too fat or too poor.
IRANDA	"I have been out with some of those guys-the short, fat, poor ones."
IRANDA	It makes absolutely no difference.
IRANDA	They are just as self-centered and unappreciative as the good-looking ones.
PETER MASON	"Why don't these women just marry a fat guy? Why don't they just marry a big, fat tub of lard?"
GROUP	"Happy birthday, dear Miranda Happy birthday to you"
CARRIE	Another 30-something birthday with a group of unmarried female friends.
CARRIE	We would all have preferred a nice celebratory conference call.
IRANDA	You were saying?
SAMANTHA	"Look. If you're a successful single woman in this city, you have two choices: You can bang your head against the wall and try and find a relationship or you can say ""screw it,"" and just go out and have sex like a man."
CHARLOTTE	You mean with dildos?
SAMANTHA	"No, I mean without feeling."
CARRIE	Samantha was a New York inspiration.
CARRIE	A public relations executive she routinely slept with good-looking guys in their 20s.
SAMANTHA	"Remember that guy I was going out with? Oh, God, what was his name?"
GROUP	Drew.
CARRIE	Drew the sex god.
SAMANTHA	Right.
SAMANTHA	Afterwards? I didn't feel a thing.
SAMANTHA	"It was like, ""Hey, babe, gotta go."
SAMANTHA	Catch ya later.
SAMANTHA	""" And I completely forgot about him after that."
CHARLOTTE	But are you sure that isn't just 'cause he didn't call you?
SAMANTHA	"Sweetheart, this is the first time in the history of Manhattan that women have had as much money and power as men plus the equal luxury of treating men like sex objects."
IRANDA	"Yeah, except men in this city fail on both counts."
IRANDA	"I mean, they don't want to be in a relationship with you but as soon as you only want them for sex, they don't like it."
IRANDA	All of a sudden they can't perform the way they're supposed to.
SAMANTHA	That's when you dump them.
CARRIE	"Ladies, are we really That cynical? What about romance?"
CHARLOTTE	Yeah.
SAMANTHA	Who needs it?
IRANDA	"It's like that guy, Jeremiah, the poet."
IRANDA	"I mean, the sex was incredible."
IRANDA	"But then he wanted to read me his poetry and go out to dinner and the whole chat bit, and I'm like, ""Let's not even go there."
CHARLOTTE	""" What are you saying? That you're just going to give up on love? That's sick."
CARRIE	"No, No, no."
CARRIE	"Believe me the right guy comes along, and you two here, this whole thing-right out the window."
CHARLOTTE	That's right!
SAMANTHA	Listen to me! The right guy is an illusion.
SAMANTHA	Start living your lives.
CARRIE	So you think it's really possible to pull off this whole women-having-sex-like-men thing?
SAMANTHA	You're forgetting The Last Seduction.
CARRIE	You're obsessed with that movie.
IRANDA	"Okay, Linda Fiorentino fucking that guy up against the chain-link fence."
SAMANTHA	"And never having one of those ""Oh, my God, what have I done?"" epiphanies."
CHARLOTTE	I hated that movie.
CARRIE	Was it true? Were women in New York really giving up on love and throttling up on power? What a tempting thought.
STANFORD BLATCH	I'm beginning to think the only place one can still find love and romance in New York is the gay community.
STANFORD BLATCH	It's straight love that's become closeted.
CARRIE	Stanford Blatch was one of my closest friends.
CARRIE	"He owned a talent agency and, at the moment, was down to a single client."
CARRIE	"So, are you telling me that you're in love?"
STANFORD BLATCH	"How could I possibly sustain a relationship? You know Derek takes up like, a thousand percent of my time."
CARRIE	Don't you think that's a bit obsessive?
STANFORD BLATCH	Carrie I'm a passionate person. His career is all I care about.
STANFORD BLATCH	"When that's under control, then I can concentrate on my personal life."
CARRIE	"Stanford, he's an underwear model."
STANFORD BLATCH	With a billboard in Times Square.
STANFORD BLATCH	"Oh, my God."
STANFORD BLATCH	Don't turn around.
STANFORD BLATCH	The loathe of your life is at the bar.
CARRIE	It was Kurt Harrington a mistake I made when I was 26 and 29 and 31.
STANFORD BLATCH	"Carrie, don't even go there."
CARRIE	What? Do you think I'm a masochist? The man is scum.
STANFORD BLATCH	Good.
STANFORD BLATCH	Because I don't have the patience to clean up this mess for the fourth time.
CARRIE	Will you relax? I don't have a shred of feeling left.
STANFORD BLATCH	Thank God.
CARRIE	"Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to visit the ladies' room."
CARRIE	It was true.
CARRIE	I no longer felt a thing for Kurt.
CARRIE	"After all these years, I finally saw him for what he was: a self-centered, withholding creep who was still the best sex I ever had in my life."
CARRIE	"However, I did have a little experiment in mind."
CARRIE	Kurt. Wow. What are you doin' here?
KURT HARRINGTON	"Hey, babe."
KURT HARRINGTON	"God, You look gorgeous."
CARRIE	Thanks.
CARRIE	"So, how's life?"
KURT HARRINGTON	Not bad. Can't complain.
CARRIE	"You? Oh, you know, just writing the column."
CARRIE	The usual.
CARRIE	"So, you seeing anyone special?"
KURT HARRINGTON	Not really. You?
CARRIE	"Oh, just a couple guys."
CARRIE	"Well, You look good, though."
KURT HARRINGTON	So do you.
CARRIE	So what are you doing later?
KURT HARRINGTON	I thought you weren't talking to me for the rest of your life.
CARRIE	Who said anything about talking?
KURT HARRINGTON	"What do you say to my place, 3:00?"
CARRIE	Alright. See ya there.
STANFORD BLATCH	Are you out of your mind? What the hell do you think you're doing?
CARRIE	"Oh, calm down."
CARRIE	It's research.
CARRIE	"Oh, God."
CARRIE	"Oh, Kurt."
CARRIE	Kurt was just like I remembered-better-because this time there would be none of that messy emotional attachment.
KURT HARRINGTON	All righty.
KURT HARRINGTON	My turn.
CARRIE	"Oh, sorry."
CARRIE	I have to go back to work.
KURT HARRINGTON	What? Are you kiddin'? You're serious?
CARRIE	"Oh, yeah. Completely."
CARRIE	But I'll give you a call.
CARRIE	Maybe we can do it again sometime.
KURT HARRINGTON	"Yeah, but-"
CARRIE	"As I began to get dressed, I realized that I'd done it."
CARRIE	I'd just had sex like a man.
CARRIE	"I left feeling powerful, potent and incredibly alive."
CARRIE	I felt like I owned this city.
CARRIE	Nothing and no one could get in my way.
CARRIE	"Number one, he's very handsome."
BIG	There ya go.
CARRIE	"Number two, he's not wearing a wedding ring."
CARRIE	"Number three, he knows I carry textured Trojans with a reservoir tip."
CARRIE	Thanks a lot.
BIG	Anytime.
CARRIE	"Later that night, Skipper met me for coffee and confessed a shocking intimate secret."
CARRIE	Thank you.
SKIPPER	"Do you know that it has been, like, a year?"
CARRIE	Really? I don't understand that.
CARRIE	You're such a nice guy.
SKIPPER	That's the problem.
SKIPPER	"I'm too nice, you know? I'm a romantic."
SKIPPER	I just have so much feeling.
CARRIE	Are you sure you're not gay?
SKIPPER	No! I'm sensitive and I don't objectify women.
SKIPPER	"You know, most guys, when they meet a girl the first thing that they see is-You know-"
CARRIE	Pussy?
SKIPPER	"Oh, God! Oh! I hate that word."
SKIPPER	Don't you have any friends that you can hook me up with?
CARRIE	They're too old for you.
SKIPPER	I like older women.
CARRIE	Maybe.
CARRIE	Maybe my friend Miranda.
SKIPPER	When?
CARRIE	Tomorrow night.
CARRIE	"We're all going downtown to this club, Chaos."
SKIPPER	Great.
SKIPPER	Don't tell her I'm nice.
CARRIE	Miranda was gonna hate Skipper.
CARRIE	She'd think he was mocking her with his sweet nature and decide he was an asshole the way she had decided all men were assholes.
CARRIE	Hello? -
CHARLOTTE	"Hey, Carrie, it's Charlotte."
CARRIE	"Hey, sweetie."
CHARLOTTE	Hey.
CHARLOTTE	"Look, I can't meet you guys for dinner tomorrow night because I have an amazing date."
CARRIE	With who?
CHARLOTTE	Capote Duncan. He's supposedly some big shot in the publishing world.
CHARLOTTE	Do you know him?
CARRIE	"Did I know him? He was one of the city's most notoriously ""un-gettable"" bachelors."
CHARLOTTE	"Wait, don't even answer that question because, frankly, I don't care."
CHARLOTTE	And another thing.
CHARLOTTE	I'm not buying any of that women-having-sex-like-men crap.
CARRIE	I didn't tell her about my afternoon of cheap and easy sex and how good it felt.
CARRIE	All right.
CARRIE	Fine.
CARRIE	"Have a good time, and promise to tell me everything."
CHARLOTTE	"Well, if you're lucky."
CHARLOTTE	Bye.
CARRIE	All Right.
CARRIE	Bye.
CARRIE	Friday night at Chaos.
CARRIE	"It was just like that bar in ""Cheers"" where everybody knows your name except here they were likely to forget it five minutes later."
CARRIE	Hi.
CARRIE	"Still, it was the creme de la creme of New York whipped into a frenzy."
CARRIE	Sometimes you got a souffle sometimes cottage cheese.
IRANDA	It is like a model bomb exploded in this room tonight.
IRANDA	Is there a woman here aside from me who weights more than a hundred pounds?
SKIPPER	"I know, it's like ""Undereaters Anonymous."
IRANDA	""" That's funny, Skippy."
SKIPPER	Skipper.
IRANDA	I have this theory That men secretly hate pretty girls because they rejected them in school.
SKIPPER	Right.
SKIPPER	"But if you're not part of the ""Beauty Olympics"" you can still become a very interesting person."
IRANDA	Are you saying that I'm not pretty enough?
SKIPPER	"No, no, no. Of course you are."
IRANDA	"So, ipso f acto, I can't be interesting? Women fall into one of two categories: beautiful and boring or homely and interesting, is that it?"
SKIPPER	"No, that's not what I meant."
IRANDA	Excuse me.
IRANDA	Is this your hand on my knee?
SKIPPER	No.
IRANDA	"Let's just keep 'em where I can see 'em, all right? Well, I guess you must find me beautiful."
IRANDA	Or interesting.
CARRIE	"I was about to rescue Skipper from an increasingly hopeless situation, when suddenly-"
KURT HARRINGTON	"Lucky me, twice in one week."
CARRIE	"Well, I don't know if you're going to be getting that lucky."
KURT HARRINGTON	"You know, I was really pissed off the way you left the other day."
CARRIE	You were?
KURT HARRINGTON	"Yeah. Then I thought, how great! You finally understand the kind of relationship I want and now we can have sex without commitment."
CARRIE	Yeah.
CARRIE	Right.
CARRIE	Sure.
CARRIE	I guess.
CARRIE	"So when I feel like it, I'll call you."
KURT HARRINGTON	"Yeah, please."
KURT HARRINGTON	Whenever you feel like it.
KURT HARRINGTON	"If I'm alone, I'm all yours."
CARRIE	Right.
KURT HARRINGTON	I like this new you.
KURT HARRINGTON	Call me.
CARRIE	Yup.
CARRIE	I didn't understand.
CARRIE	"Did all men secretly want their women promiscuous and emotionally detached? And if I was really having sex like a man, why didn't I feel more in control?"
SAMANTHA	You see that guy? He's the next Donald Trump except he's younger and much better looking.
CARRIE	Hi.
SAMANTHA	You know him?
CARRIE	No. I've never seen him in my life.
SAMANTHA	"He usually dates models, but, hey, I'm as good-looking as a model plus I own my own business."
CARRIE	Samantha had the kind of deluded self-confidence that caused men like Ross Perot to run for president and it usually got her what she wanted.
SAMANTHA	"Well, if you're not gonna hit on him, I will."
CARRIE	And there she went-off to take her best shot with Big.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, Charlotte York was having a splendid evening with Capote Duncan."
CAPOTE DUNCAN	Wanna go back to my place and see the Ross Blechner?
CHARLOTTE	"I'd love to, but it's really getting late."
CAPOTE DUNCAN	No problem.
CHARLOTTE	What year was It painted again?
CAPOTE DUNCAN	89
CARRIE	Though Charlotte was determined to play hard-to-get she didn't want to end the evening too abruptly.
CHARLOTTE	"Well, maybe just for a minute."
CHARLOTTE	This could easily go for a hundred grand.
CHARLOTTE	Ross is so hot right now.
CHARLOTTE	It's beautiful.
CAPOTE DUNCAN	"No, you're beautiful."
CHARLOTTE	Thank you for tonight.
CAPOTE DUNCAN	Yeah?
CHARLOTTE	I had a wonderful time.
CAPOTE DUNCAN	"Well, it was my pleasure."
CHARLOTTE	I have to get up really early tomorrow.
CAPOTE DUNCAN	I'll get you a cab.
CARRIE	Charlotte told me she thought she had played the entire evening flawlessly.
CAPOTE DUNCAN	"So, what are you doing next Saturday?"
CHARLOTTE	I'm having dinner with you.
CAPOTE DUNCAN	"You're going to the West Side, right?"
CHARLOTTE	Right.
CHARLOTTE	"West Fourth and Bank, please."
CAPOTE DUNCAN	"Hey, scoot over, will ya? Two stops: Fourth and Bank and West Broadway and Broom."
CHARLOTTE	You're going to Chaos?
CAPOTE DUNCAN	Oh. Yeah.
CHARLOTTE	Why?
CAPOTE DUNCAN	"Look, I understand where you're coming from and I totally respect it but I really need to have sex tonight."
CARRIE	Back at Chaos things were swinging into high gear and Samantha was putting the moves on Big.
BIG	I've been smoking cigars for years back when they were terminally uncool.
SAMANTHA	I've got this great source that sends me Hondurans.
SAMANTHA	Do you want to try one?
BIG	"No, thank you."
SAMANTHA	Really? You can't find them anywhere.
BIG	Cohibas-that's all I smoke.
SAMANTHA	"Look, I do the PR for this club and I have the key to the private room downstairs."
BIG	Really?
SAMANTHA	You want a private tour?
BIG	"No, thanks, but maybe another time."
CARRIE	Meanwhile Skipper was hopelessly smitten with Miranda Hobbes.
SKIPPER	"So, where we goin' now?"
IRANDA	"Listen, Skippy you know, you really are a nice, sweet guy, but-"
SKIPPER	"Oh, I understand."
IRANDA	Good night.
CARRIE	Miranda told me later that she thought he was too nice but that she was willing to overlook one flaw and Capote Duncan found his fix for the night.
SAMANTHA	Where is it? I wanna see the Ross Blechner.
CAPOTE DUNCAN	Wait.
CAPOTE DUNCAN	Later.
CAPOTE DUNCAN	Later.
CAPOTE DUNCAN	"Oh, listen, l-I gotta get up really early and, actually, you can't stay over."
CAPOTE DUNCAN	Cool?
SAMANTHA	Sure. I have to get up really early too.
CARRIE	Taxi! Taxi! And so another Friday night in Manhattan crept towards dawn.
CARRIE	Just when I thought I would have to do the unspeakable-walk home-
BIG	"Well, get in, for Christ's sakes."
BIG	where can I drop you?
CARRIE	72nd Street and Third Avenue.
BIG	"have You got That, Al?"
AL	Yes sir.
BIG	"So, what have you been doing lately?"
CARRIE	You mean besides going out every night?
BIG	"I mean, what do you do for work?"
CARRIE	"Well, this is my work."
CARRIE	I'm sort of a sexual anthropologist.
BIG	You mean like a hooker?
CARRIE	"No. I write a column called ""Sex and the City."
CARRIE	""" Right now I'm researching an article about women who have sex like men."
CARRIE	"You know, they have sex and then afterwards they feel nothing."
BIG	But you're not like that.
CARRIE	"Well, aren't you?"
BIG	Not a drop. Not even half a drop.
CARRIE	Wow.
CARRIE	What's wrong with you?
BIG	I get it. You've never been in love.
CARRIE	"Oh, yeah?"
BIG	Yeah.
CARRIE	Suddenly I felt the wind knocked out of me.
CARRIE	I wanted to crawl under the covers and go right to sleep.
CARRIE	Thanks for the ride.
BIG	Anytime.
CARRIE	Wait.
CARRIE	Have you ever been in love?
BIG	Abso-fuckin'-lutely.
CARRIE	Last night my friend Miranda got invited to a dinner party by a man she hardly knew.
CARRIE	She was the date of Nick a fairly successful sports agent who once told her she had nice legs.
NICK	Okay.
NICK 	Old movie stars you'd have liked to fuck when they were young.
IRANDA 	Alive or dead? It doesn't matter.
NICK 	I'll start.
NICK 	"Veronica Lake, the year she made Sullivan's Travels."
DAVE	Dave? I'd have to say Sophia Loren.
DAVE	Probably 'cause my dad had this thing for her.
DAVES GIRLFRIEND 	We won't go there.
DAVES GIRLFRIEND 	Montgomery Clift.
DINNER GUEST 1	he was gay.
DAVES GIRLFRIEND 	Oh.
 DINNER GUEST 2	"Marilyn Monroe, before the Kennedys got to her."
DINNER GUEST 2	Honey?
DINNER GUEST 1	"Bing Crosby, I stand by my choice"
IRANDA 	Sean Connery.
IRANDA 	"Yesterday, today and tomorrow."
CARRIE	"For a first date, Miranda felt like she was hitting it out of the ballpark."
IRANDA 	Thanks.
DAVES GIRLFRIEND 	So how long have you known Nick?
IRANDA 	We've been riding the same elevator line for years and then we had lunch a few weeks ago and then he invited me here to dinner.
DINNER GUEST 1	He's very smart.
DAVES GIRLFREIND	Guess he took our ultimatum seriously.
DINNER GUEST 1	Deanne.
IRANDA 	What are you talking about?
CARRIE	They told Miranda that Nick had this thing for models.
NICK	Old movie stars you'd have liked to fuck when they were young.
NICK	I'll start.
NICK	"Veronica Lake, the year she made Sullivan's Travels."
NICK	Dave?
DAVE	I'd have to go with Sophia Loren.
DAVE 	Probably.
DAVE	My dad had a thing for her.
DEANNE	Montgomery Clift.
DINNER GUEST 2 	Marilyn Monroe.
DINNER GUEST 1	Bing Crosby.
DAVE 	Yvette?
YVETTE	I don't know. Charlie Sheen?
CARRIE	They'd come to dinner push their food around and pout.
NICK 	Veronica Lake.
DAVE	Sophia Loren.
DEANNE	Montgomery Clift.
DINNER GUEST2 	Marilyn Monroe.
DINNER GUEST 1	Bing Crosby.
NICK	Marissa? She had to make a phone call.
CARRIE	It got to be a problem.
CARRIE	They decided to take action.
DINNER GUEST 1	"Can't you find a woman who can carry on a decent conversation? Yeah, Nick."
DEANNE	And eat without purging.
NICK	What are you saying? You can't bring around any more of these so-called models.
DINNER GUEST 1 	It's too depressing.
NICK	"Okay, okay."
NICK	I'll see what I can do.
DINNER GUEST1 	And then he brought you.
DINNER GUEST 1	So obviously not a model.
DINNER GUEST 1	In a good way!
IRANDA 	Nick dates models?
CARRIE	"Miranda confronted him, and it didn't take him long to fold."
NICK	It's true.
NICK	"It's true, okay? I'm obsessed."
IRANDA 	Obsessed with models.
NICK	Correct.
IRANDA 	So what am l? Your intellectual beard for the evening?
NICK	"Don't be pissed, all right? You gotta admit, you met some nice people."
NICK	You had a good time.
CARRIE	Okay? You were on a date with a modelizer and you didn't even know it?
IRANDA 	"If men like Nick are dating models, what chance do ordinary women have? Do you have to be a supermodel to get a date in New York? Modelizers are a particular breed."
CARRIE	They're a step beyond womanizers who will sleep with just about anything in a skirt.
CARRIE	"Modelizers are obsessed not with women, but with models who in most cities are safely confined to billboards and magazines but in Manhattan, actually run wild on the streets turning the city into a virtual Model Country Safari where men can pet the creatures in their natural habitat."
CARRIE	As if we didn't have enough problems.
IRANDA 	They're stupid and lazy and should be shot on sight.
SAMANTHA	"I've been out with lots of guys and they say I am just as beautiful as a model, but I work for a living."
SAMANTHA	"I'm like, well-I'm like a model who's taken the high road."
IRANDA 	"The advantages given to models and to beautiful women in general are so unfair, it makes me puke."
SAMANTHA	"Sweetheart, You are So cute."
IRANDA 	Cute doesn't cut it in this town.
IRANDA 	What's cute compared to supermodel?
CARRIE 	There's nothing like raising the subject of models among four single women to spice up an otherwise dull Tuesday night.
IRANDA 	"They have this distant, sexy look."
SAMANTHA	"That's not sexy, it's starvation."
CHARLOTTE	That's starvation in the best restaurants.
IRANDA 	"What I wanna know is when did all the men get together and decide that they would only get it up for giraffes with big breasts? In some cultures, heavy women with mustaches are considered beautiful."
SAMANTHA	You're looking at me while you're saying that?
IRANDA 	We should just admit that we live in a culture that promotes impossible standards of beauty.
CARRIE	Except men think they're possible.
IRANDA 	Yeah.
CHARLOTTE	"No matter how good I feel about myself if I see Christy Turlington, I just wanna give up."
IRANDA 	"I wanna force-feed her lard, but that's the difference between you and me."
CARRIE	What are you talking about? Look at you two.
CARRIE	You're beautiful.
CHARLOTTE	I hate my thighs.
CARRIE	"Oh, come on."
CHARLOTTE	"I can't even open a magazine without thinking, ""thighs, thighs, thighs."
IRANDA 	""" I'll take your thighs and raise you a chin."
IRANDA 	I'll take your chin and raise you a-
CARRIE	"What? Oh, come on."
SAMANTHA	I happen to love the way I look.
IRANDA 	You should.
IRANDA 	You paid enough for it.
SAMANTHA	"Hey, I resent that."
SAMANTHA	I do not believe in plastic surgery.
SAMANTHA	"Well, not yet."
CARRIE	I find it fascinating that four beautiful flesh and blood women could be intimidated by some unreal fantasy.
CARRIE	"I mean, look."
CHARLOTTE	Look at this.
CARRIE	Is this really intimidating to any of you? -
CHARLOTTE	I hate my thighs.
IRANDA 	Pass the chicken.
SAMANTHA	I have that dress.
CARRIE	Suddenly I was interested.
CARRIE	"If models could cause otherwise rational individuals to crumble in their presence, exactly how powerful was beauty? There are two types of guys that fall for beautiful women."
WOMAN 1	Either they're slime-balls that are just out to get laid or they fall in love with you instantly.
WOMAN1	It's pathetic.
NICK	Why fuck the girl in the skirt if you can fuck the girl in the ad for the skirt? Being beautiful is such a power.
ODEL	You can get whatever you want.
ODEL	You can get anything.
ODEL	"I've been off ered trips to Aspen, weekends in Paris Christmas in St."
ODEL	Barts.
ODEL MAN	"A motorcycle, a juicer."
NICK	It's not like models don't have brains.
NICK	They have them.
NICK	They just don't need to use them.
WOMAN 2	"Most guys just think you're dumb, but I'm really very literary."
WOMAN 2 	I read.
WOMAN 2	I'll sit down and read a whole magazine from cover to cover.
ODEL MAN 	Some scuba gear a Herb Ritt's photo.
ODEL 	"A Bulgari necklace, a breast job."
NICK	My friends think I'm shallow.
NICK	Sometimes I think they're right.
NICK	"Other times I think, ""Hey, I'm fucking a model."
BARKLEY	""" Models are a lot looser than you think."
BARKLEY	It's way easier to screw a model than a regular girl 'cause that's what they do all the time.
BARKLEY	It's how regular people are when they're on vacation.
CARRIE	"Barkley, a notorious modelizer was one of those SoHo wonders who maintained a fabulous lifestyle despite never having sold a single painting."
CARRIE	So you're saying it's easy to meet them?
BARKLEY	"No, it's not so easy."
BARKLEY	"The trick is, you gotta treat them like they're regular girls."
BARKLEY	"You gotta be able to roll into a place, walk up to the hottest thing there."
BARKLEY	Otherwise you're finished.
BARKLEY	It's kind of like being around dogs.
BARLEY	You gotta show No fear.
CARRIE	Things? You call them Things? Yeah.
BARKLEY	"Well, they are things."
BARKLEY	They're beautiful things.
BARKLEY	And that's what my life's about.
BARKLEY	Beauty.
BARKLEY	Come here.
BARKLEY	I want to show you something.
BARKLEY	This is my real art only I can't really show it to the public.
BARKLEY	"Well, not yet, at least."
BARKLEY	Sit down.
BARKLEY	That's Vanessa.
BARKLEY	That's Tanya.
BARKLEY	Elana.
BARKLEY	Katrina.
CARRIE	I couldn't believe it.
CARRIE	The man had slept with half the perfume ads in September's Vogue.
CARRIE	Do they know about this? Maybe.
BARKLEY	"Oh, look at that one."
BARKLEY	"She does runway now, but I think she's gonna be huge someday."
CARRIE	I didn't know what to say.
CARRIE	There really wasn't anything to say except-Do you have a light?
BARKLEY	Sure.
CARRIE	Later that day I was relieved to discover that at least one eligible bachelor got his kicks off the runway.
SKIPPER	So I totally dig your friend Miranda.
CARRIE	That's great.
SKIPPER	"Yeah, I think she is so sexy and smart and-Did she tell you that we made out? No."
SKIPPER	"Yeah, it was totally hot."
CARRIE	Why don't you call her? You should call her.
SKIPPER	"I did, like a hundred times."
SKIPPER	She totally won't return my phone calls.
SKIPPER	"Did she say anything about me? I don't know, maybe she's just busy."
SKIPPER	Am I not cute enough for her? .
CARRIE	"Of course you are, Skipper"
CARRIE	You're adorable.
SKIPPER	I don't know.
SKIPPER	Find out for me.
SKIPPER	I wanna see if I still have a chance.
CARRIE	"Right now, in front Of you? I can handle it."
IRANDA ANSWERING MACHINE	"Hi, this is Miranda."
IRANDA ANSWERING MACHINE	Please leave me a message.
CARRIE	"Oh, it's her machine."
SKIPPER	"Hey, this is Skipper."
SKIPPER	I'm in the street with Carrie.
SKIPPER	I just told her how you won't call me back.
SKIPPER	So now you have to call me back.
SKIPPER	"You better call me back! No, I'm kidding."
SKIPPER	I'm joking.
SKIPPER	"But seriously, I hope you call me back and did I mention this was Skipper?"
CARRIE	I believe there is a curse put on the head of anybody who tries to fix up their friends.
CARRIE	"Where better to find modelizers in their natural habitat than a fashion show? Luckily, my friend Stanf ord Blatch had a client in the hottest show in town."
STANFORD	"""The Bone"" is like the human equivalent of the sable coat."
STANFORD	He's so beautiful that I find that sometimes I have to look away.
CARRIE	do You see him? Right over there.
STANFORD	Where? look at him.
STANFORD	It's like he travels with his own personal lighting director.
CARRIE	"Derek, a."
CARRIE	k.
CARRIE	a.
CARRIE	"""The Bone"" was the world's biggest underwear model and Stanf ord's most important client as well as the subject of his single-minded obsession."
THE BONE	"Hey, Stanny."
STANFORD	"Derek, I would like you to meet a very dear friend, Carrie Bradshaw."
DEREK	Nice to meet you.
STANFORD	"Carrie writes ""Sex And The City."
DEREK	""" Wow, that's great."
CARRIE	have You read it?
STANFORD	"The other day, Derek and I were walking past his billboard and he told me he'd like to get a piece of it for his apartment Iike maybe his nose."
STANFORD	"And I said, ""You should get the bulge in your pants."
STANFORD	"That way when women ask how big you are, you can say, 'Fourteen feet'."
STANFORD	""" That would be funny, wouldn't it? Yeah."
STANFORD	Everybody's talking about you.
STANFORD	You are so great.
STANFORD	You're gonna be a star.
STANFORD	Have I told you that enough? You're a star! You're a star!
CARRIE	We'd better let you get dressed.
DEREK	I am dressed.
CARRIE	We'll see you after the show.
DEREK	Bye.
STANFORD	"Can you believe anyone that beautiful can be that nice? I keep dreaming that someday he's gonna say, ""Stanford, I love you."
CARRIE	""" Is he gay? He denies it."
STANFORD	How could anyone that gorgeous be straight?
SAMANTHA	"Sweetie, over here!"
CARRIE	Samantha Jones never missed a major fashion show.She was one of the only people I knew who thought that proximity to beauty made her feel more attractive.
CARRIE	"Hey, sweetie, what happened? You couldn't find seats right on the runway? Oh, you can see all the flaws from this angle."
SAMANTHA	"Hey, Carrie."
SAMANTHA	"Barkley, how are you? You going to the party afterwards? I don't know."
SAMANTHA	Of course we are.
BARKLEY	Hi.
SAMANTHA	I'm Samantha.
BARKLEY	Barkley.
SAMANTHA	Martini straight up or with a twist?
CARRIE	Straight up.
SAMANTHA	Really? He's very cute.
SAMANTHA	You're not dating him?
CARRIE	"God, no.He's a total modelizer."
SAMANTHA	Is he dating any one model in particular?
CARRIE	"Actually, he's sleeping with all of them in general."
SAMANTHA	Only models? Only models.
CARRIE	Later that night we all went downtown f or a party.
CARRIE	I was beginning to float away on a sea of sweet potato puffs with smoked salmon and sour cream when-It was Mr.
CARRIE	"Big: major tycoon major dream boat, and majorly out of my league."
BIG	I thought I saw you on the runway.
CARRIE	Hi.
BIG	I started reading your column after we met.
CARRIE	You did? Yeah.
BIG	Cute.
CARRIE	Cute?
BIG	"Well-Yeah, cute."
BIG 	What are you writing about this week?
CARRIE	"Well, I'm working on a story about menwho date models."
CARRIE	Any thoughts?
BIG	Only that they're very lucky.So what have you discovered about these men who are dating models?
CARRIE	"Well, I'm discovering that some of them treat it as a competitive sport and others I think just need the validation."
CARRIE	And probably others just have a thing for exceptionally beautiful women.
BIG	Exactly.
BIG	And there's something wrong with that? There's nothing wrong.
CARRIE	I just think it might become a bit monotonous.
CARRIE	Puff?
BIG	"No, thanks."
STRANGER	Excuse me.
BIG	So where do you-Where do you write these stories? Have you got an office or anything?
CARRIE	"My cute stories?About half the time I'm at my apartment, and the other half I'm over at this coffee shop on 73rd and Madison."
BIG 	"Oh, Carrie, I'd like you to meet Misha."
CARRIE	Hi.
CARRIE	You were great in the show.
ISHA	Thank you.
CARRIE	Suddenly I felt like I was wearing patchouli in a room full of Chanel.
BIG	"Well, it was nice talking to you."
R.BIG	"See you around sometime, I hope."
CARRIE	I thought I had come to terms with my looks the year I turned 30 when I realized that I no longer had the energy to be completely superficial.
SAMANTHA	"Your friend Barkley, he's really been coming on to me."
SAMANTHA	Do you actually think he believes I'm a model? You don't want to go there.
CARRIE	Why not? he has this thing for secretly taping his conquests.
SAMANTHA	Really? What a pervert.
CARRIE	As Samantha began to get ready for her close-up I felt it was time to call it a night.
CARRIE	I had never felt so invisible in my entire life.
CARRIE	Taxi! Carrie.
DEREK	"Hey, Hi."
CARRIE	Did Stanford leave?
DEREK	"No, he's in there giving a neck massage to a Versace model."
DEREK	"So, where are you going now? -"
CARRIE	I'm going home.
DEREK	Can I come? -
CARRIE	You wanna come home with me?
DEREK	"Sure, if it's quiet.I can't take these crowds."
CARRIE	The things you gotta do in the name of research.
CARRIE	Shouldn't you be spending the night with some girl from the show?
DEREK	"No, I never date models.I think they're stupid."
CARRIE	I wondered if there wasn't some kind of physics for beauty.
CARRIE	Maybe two models repelled.
CARRIE	Maybe models could only be attracted to ordinary humans.
DEREK	"So, I think it's so cool that you write."
CARRIE	Thanks.
DEREK	I wish I Could write.
DEREK	"I've got intense thoughts, but I can't keep them in my head long enough to get them down on paper."
CARRIE	That's the big trick.
DEREK	"The truth is, I'm totally neurotic."
DEREK	"One minute I can be walking down the street, totally cool and the next minute I'm depressed for no reason."
DEREK	I'm totally self-conscious.
DEREK	"Before I say something, I say it in my head first so it doesn't come out wrong."
CARRIE	Doesn't that seem like a waste of time?
DEREK	It only takes a second.And sometimes I get so distracted.
CARRIE	What's distracting you now?
DEREK	Your nose.
CARRIE	Thanks a lot.
CARRIE	I hate my nose.
DEREK	It's just so cute.
DEREK	I hate my nose too.
DEREK	It's too big.
DEREK	But I think It depends on my hair.
CARRIE	Yeah.
CARRIE	I see what you mean.
DEREK	So what do you want to be when you grow up?
CARRIE	"Well, I think this might be it."
CARRIE	What do you want to be when you grow up?
DEREK	I'd like to move back to lowa and have kids and be a cop.
CARRIE	I felt like I was in my bedroom when I was 16 and I used to hang out with this guy who was really beautiful and my parents thought I was helping him with his chemistry homework.
DEREK	Do you mind if we just lie here? I get so lonely in the city.
DEREK	Sometimes it's just nice to lie with someone.
CARRIE	Sure.
CARRIE	We could do that.
CARRIE	It was hard to imagine that anyone so beautiful could ever be lonely.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, somewhere below 14th Street two ordinary joes were doing their own lonely late-night thing."
COUNTER GUY	Anything else?
IRANDA 	That's it.
COUNTER GUY	Just cat food?
IRANDA	"Yes, just cat food."
IRANDA	"Oh, hi, Skipper."
SKIPPER	"So like, how come you haven't been returning any of my calls? I'm sorry."
IRANDA	It's been a really busy week.
SKIPPER	I thought we had a connection.
IRANDA	I don't know.
IRANDA	"Could I get my change? No, it's just-It's got nothing to do with age."
SKIPPER	You get that way with every guy that you're with?
IRANDA	Don't you wanna go out with a girl your own age?
SKIPPER	I think you're luminous.
IRANDA	You think I'm luminous? -
SKIPPER	Totally.
CARRIE	Miranda couldn't resist the vision of herself reflected in Skipper's slightly smudged lenses.
IRANDA	"All right, let's get out of here."
SKIPPER	Let me just pay f or my Cap'n Crunch.
IRANDA	There's cereal at my place.
CARRIE	And Samantha found the ultimate validation: sex with Barkley.
SAMANTHA	So where is it? The camera.
BARKLEY	What?
BARKLEY	Your friend Carrie tell you about that? Don't worry.
BARKLEY	I only tape models.
SAMANTHA	I won't mind.
BARKLEY	Fine.
BARKLEY	I'll make an exception.
CARRIE	Samantha demanded nothing less than the same consideration given every other model in town.
SATNFORD	"Hello? Carrie, it's Stanford."
STANFORD	"Do you have any idea what happened to Derek last night? Actually you'll never believe it, but-Yes? It's Stanford."
CARRIE	"Hi, Stanford."
STANFORD	Derek? Sure.
STANFORD	Could you put Carrie back on the phone?
CARRIE	Hello.
STANFORD	how Could you?
CARRIE	I didn't.
CARRIE	We just talked.
STANFORD	I knew he was gay.
NICK	It's amazing what you'll do to be with these models.
NICK	I've gotta retire soon.
NICK	"They keep me from getting work done, they make me fuck up my life."
NICK	Look at me! I'm an old man at 34.
CARRIE	I began to realize that being beautiful is like having a rent-controlled apartment overlooking the park: completely unfair and usually bestowed upon those who deserve it least.
BIG	"I'm not interrupting your work, am l? Hey, what a surprise."
BIG	I can't stay.
BIG	I'm late for a meeting.
BIG	But I've been thinking about your article about men who date models.
CARRIE	What about them?
BIG 	"First of all, there are so many goddamn gorgeous women in this city."
CARRIE	What an amazing observation.
BIG	But the thing is this.
BIG	After a while you just wanna be with the one that makes you laugh.
BIG	Know what I mean? Okay.
CARRIE	See ya.
CARRIE	I take that back.
CARRIE	Beauty is fleeting but a rent-controlled apartment overlooking the park is forever.
CARRIE	One of the best things about living in a city like New York is leaving it.
CARRIE	My friend Patience and her husband invited me to the Hamptons for the weekend.
CARRIE	Patience and Peter were the perfect married couple.
CARRIE	"They were fun, smart and they looked like they fell out of a J."
CARRIE	Crew catalog.
CARRIE	"If their house wasn't right on the beach, I would have hated them."
CARRIE	So he gets in the cab and slides up next to me.
PETER	Yes? And it is hot.
CARRIE	It is hot all the way from Houston and West Broadway to 72nd and Madison.
CARRIE	Hampton houseguests are always required to sing for their supper.
CARRIE	Brokers give investment advice.
CARRIE	"Architects, design advice."
CARRIE	Single people give married friends tidbits from their sexual escapades.
CARRIE	The next morning I woke up feeling rested and fabulous.
CARRIE	I couldn't wait to go out and take in the spectacular view.
PETER	MorningPatience went out to get juice and muffins.
PETER	She'll be right back.
CARRIE	There he was-full-frontal friend.
CARRIE	"Good! He just stood there, casual, happy, hanging out."
CARRIE	I didn't know what to do or say.
CARRIE	Great! I only knew one thing-that's way too much Peter before coffee.
PATIENCE	good morning.
CARRIE	Hey.
PATIENCE	Got some fresh juice and the good muffins.
CARRIE	So what's happening? I ran into Peter in the hallway without his underwear on.
CARRIE	P.
CARRIE	S.
CARRIE	Congratulations.
PETER	Sunny day.
PATIENCE	"Honey, did Carrie see your dick in the hall? Yeah, she caught me on the way to the bathroom."
PETER	Oh.
PETER	"""On the way to the bathroom."
CARRIE	""" Oh, yeah! The good muffins."
CARRIE	"So what are we doing today? I barely had time to shove a ""good muffin"" in my purse before I was on my way back to New York."
CARRIE	I'm confused.
SAMANTHA	Why would he do that? Did he want to have sex with you? I don't know.
CARRIE	It didn't feel sexual.
SAMANTHA	Maybe we wanted to show it off.
SAMANTHA	Like a monkey.
SAMANTHA	"So how big was it? Fresh pepper? Yes, please."
CARRIE	Thank you very much.
CARRIE	That'll do.
SAMANTHA	"Would you like some fresh pepper? Oh, honey, I'd love some fresh pepper."
SAMANTHA	"In fact, I think everyone at this table could use a lot of fresh pepper."
SAMANTHA	Thanks.
CARRIE	So I told her I didn't understand why she was so upset.
CARRIE	She said I couldn't understand it.
CARRIE	I'm single.
IRANDA	"And what? Single women prowl beach houses hoping for glimpses of their friends' husbands' dicks? How good a friend was she? What's the diff erence? When someone gets married, all bets are off."
IRANDA	"They become married, and we become the enemy."
CARRIE	As the only single lawyer working at her law firm Miranda had given this topic some thought.
IRANDA	"Married women are threatened because we can have sex anytime, anywhere with anyone."
CARRIE	"We can? And they're afraid we're gonna have it anytime, anywhere with their husbands."
CHARLOTTE	I would never sleep with a married man.
SAMANTHA	"What makes you so sure you haven't? Wedding rings come off, you know."
SAMANTHA	"Face it, ladies."
SAMANTHA	"If you're still single, you are not to be trusted."
CHARLOTTE	Come on! Not all married women feel that way.
CARRIE	Charlotte treated marriage like a sorority she was hoping to pledge.
IRANDA	You're right.
IRANDA	Not all.
IRANDA	The ones who don't fear you pity you.
CHARLOTTE	That's not true.
IRANDA	"Are you telling me you haven't gotten those ""poor single you"" Iooks? I hate those."
CHARLOTTE	"Okay, Yes, I have."
CHARLOTTE	I hate it when you're the only single person at a dinner party and they all look at you like you're a-Loser.
IRANDA	Leper.
SAMANTHA	Whore.
IRANDA	"Exactly! I'm telling you, married people are the enemy."
CARRIE	Was Miranda right? Were we enemies? Is there a secret cold war between marrieds and singles? I love my single friends.
ARRIED WOMAN1 	But now that I'm married I don't see them as much as I used to.
SINGLE WOMAN1 	It's too painful.
ARRIED WOMAN1 	They remind me of how desperate I used to be.
SINGLE WOMAN1 	"When women get married, they forget who they are."
SINGLE WOMAN1 	"""I"" becomes ""we."
SINGLE WOMAN1 	""" ""We"" Ioved the movie."
SINGLE WOMAN1 	"""We"" hate that restaurant."
SINGLE MAN	My best buddy and I did everything together.
SINGLE MAN	Then he married this girl who doesn't like me.
SINGLE MAN	Now I only see him on Super Bowl Sunday.
ARRIED WOMAN1 	It's all about what you want out of life.
ARRIED WOMAN1 	"Some people, like me, choose to grow up face reality and get married."
ARRIED WOMAN1 	"Others choose to, what? Live an empty, haunted life of stunted adolescence."
STANFORD	"No, it's not a cold war."
STANFORD	It's an out-and-out battle.
STANFORD	And it isn't just straight people.
STANFORD	"Every gay guy I know is running off to Hawaii putting on a caftan, reciting vows and feeling superior to me."
CARRIE	Caftan? -
STANFORD	"Oh, yes, with orchid leis."
CARRIE	Aloha.
STANFORD	I miss the old times when everyone was alone.
STANFORD	Now I'm starting to feel like I'm an outcast in the outcasts.
CARRIE	"Oh, my God! Joe! It's been years."
CARRIE	I haven't seen you since you were-Straight? I was gonna say in Miss Saigon.
JOE	Still am.
STANFORD	I love Miss Saigon.
CARRIE	"Oh, this is my friend Stanford."
JOE	This is my life partner Lou.
CARRIE	"Oh, look at that."
CARRIE	Congratulations.
STANFORD	Where are you registered? Barney's.
STANFORD	I was kidding.
JOE	How about you? Are you married? Not really.
CARRIE	I mean no! Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Perfect! What? Lou and I want to have a child.
JOE	"We already have a surrogate, but we need a topnotch egg."
JOE	"What are your feelings about donating one? Listen, here's our card."
JOE PARTNER	"You think about it, and give us a call."
JOE PARTNER	We'll pay.
JOE	Great seeing you.
CARRIE	I had just experienced single-bashing for the new millennium.
CARRIE	I was no longer considered a person.
CARRIE	I was now an egg farm.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, in a park downtown another single woman was about to be humiliated."
CARRIE	Miranda was obliged to attend her firm's annual softball game.
CARRIE	"A law firm softball game is like any other except when a lawyer steals a base, he gets promoted."
LAWYER FRIEND	Miranda.
LAWYER FRIEND	I was afraid you wouldn't come.
IRANDA	All right.
IRANDA	Let's get it over with.
CARRIE	Panicked at the idea of spending another firm function labeled as a leper Miranda had agreed to be fixed up on a blind date.
LAWYER FRIEND	"Miranda, this is Syd."
LAWYER FRIEND	"Syd, Miranda."
LAWYER FRIEND	Look at you two.
LAWYER FRIEND	It's a perfect match.
LAWYER FRIEND	"Well, I'm gonna excuse myself."
SYD	Nice to meet you.
IRANDA	You too.
IRANDA	I'm gonna get a soda.
IRANDA	You want a soda? Yeah.
IRANDA	I'm gonna get us a soda.
IRANDA	Jeff.
JEFF	"Pretty great, huh? Can I pick 'em or what? ."
IRANDA	I'm not gay.
JEFF	Seriously? I've been with the firm eight months.
JEFF	I haven't once seen you with a guy.
IRANDA	"Circumstantial, Jeff."
IRANDA	I'm single.
IRANDA	Christ! When did being single translate into being gay? Shit.
JEFF	"You want me to go over there-No, I'll do it."
CARRIE	Brave Miranda marched right over and told Syd she wasn't.
CARRIE	They had a good laugh and decided to stay and play ball.
CARRIE	Miranda and Syd's last-inning double play got the attention of everyone even the firm's senior partner.
CHIP	"That was quite a play, ladies."
IRANDA	"It's all about teamwork, Charles."
CHIP	Chip.
IRANDA	Chip.
CHIP	My wife and I are having a dinner party on the 12th.
CHIP	"Just some couples, nothing fancy."
CHIP	We'd love it if you both could make it.
IRANDA	We'd love to.
CARRIE	"Later that night, Miranda gave me the lowdown on her day."
CARRIE	So you think it's just because they think you're in a couple? I know it.
IRANDA	I've been with the firm for two years.
IRANDA	He's barely spoken to me.
IRANDA	"All of a sudden, it's ""Chip."
CARRIE	""" A lawyer named Chip."
CARRIE	Gotta love that.
IRANDA	And they seemed so relieved to have finally figured me out.
CARRIE	So you're going to the dinner? Yup.
IRANDA	I'm determined to make partner in this firm even if I have to be a lesbian partner.
CARRIE	"After Miranda left, I had a thought."
CARRIE	Maybe the cold war isn't about hate.
CARRIE	"Maybe it's about fear, fear of the unknown."
CARRIE	Married people don't hate singles.
CARRIE	They just want us figured out.
CARRIE	I felt it was time to stop all the speculation and infiltrate the enemy camp.
CARRIE	"Lunch with my favorite couple, David and Lisa."
DAVID	"Well, I don't think of us as married so much as together."
LISA	Wait.
LISA	Are we married? Yeah.
DAVID	"Remember that day you wore the white dress and we got all the flatware? Oh, yeah."
LISA	I guess I should stop seeing other men.
DAVID	What about you? You like being single?
CARRIE	"Most of the time, yeah."
CARRIE	Then there are the other times.
CARRIE	Like family functions when you're the only one that's not married and they sit you at the kid's table.
CARRIE	"Or when you two eat off the same fork, I just-Oh, man, that's so sweet."
LISA	Don't start crying.
LISA	He's such a pussy.
DAVID	"But you do want to get married someday, right? I don't know."
CARRIE	I'm beginning to think I may not be the marrying kind.
LISA	Really?
CARRIE	No sooner had the words come out of my mouth than I wondered if they were true.
DAVID	"Hey, Sean! What a surprise! This is our friend Carrie."
DAVID	We just about to have dessert.
LISA	Want to join us?
SEAN	Sure.
LISA	This is such a surprise.
CARRIE	"Another time I hate being single is when married friends ""surprise"" fix you up."
CARRIE	Two espressos and a tiramisu later I had learned that Sean was the youngest of three brothers had his own investment firm and was about to move into an apartment he had just purchased.
SEAN	"You know this was a fix-up, right?"
CARRIE	"Oh, please.I could smell it before you walked in the door."
SEAN	My parents met on a fix-up and they will be married Wow.
CARRIE	That's great.
CARRIE	It was then I realized I was having coffee with the marrying guy.
CARRIE	That elusive and rare Manhattan man whose sights were set on marriage.
SEAN	"So, Carrie, can I see you again? Sure."
CARRIE	"Over the next week and a half, I met Sean for a movie I met him for another movie and I helped him pick out a top of the line cheese grater at Williams-Sonoma."
SEAN	My buddies are giving me a big housewarming on the 12th.
SEAN	You should come and bring your friends.
CARRIE	Sounds like fun.
SEAN	Thanks for a great day.
CARRIE	He was like the flesh-and-blood equivalent of a DKNY dress.
CARRIE	"You know it's not your style, but it's right there so you try it on anyway."
CARRIE	It was the night of the 12th.
CARRIE	On the East Side a pseudo-lesbian couple attended a right-wing Republican dinner party.
CARRIE	"On the West Side, a trio of single gals went to a single guy's housewarming party."
CHARLOTTE	So are his friends cute? -
CARRIE	Don't know.
CARRIE	I haven't met them yet.
CHARLOTTE	How did you manage to get a new boyfriend in a week? He's not my boyfriend.
CARRIE	He's just somebody I'm trying on.
CARRIE	All right.
CARRIE	"Ready? Everywhere I looked, people were standing in twos."
CARRIE	It was like Noah's Upper West Side rent controlled ark.
SAMANTHA	It's all married couples.
CARRIE	Samantha gave me a look like I had sold her to the enemy for chocolate bars and nylons.
CARRIE	this is for you.
SEAN	Thank you.
SEAN	You must be Charlotte.
SEAN	and You have to be Samantha.
SEAN	Yeah.
SAMANTHA	Where's the bar? Kitchen.
SEAN	You can't miss it.
SEAN	Room with the stove.
CHARLOTTE	this apartment is amazing.
SEAN	I've been planning it for years.
SEAN	I'll give you the grand tour.
CARRIE	"As I moved through the married couples, I noticed something was different."
CARRIE	"No fear, no pity, no pointing."
CARRIE	"Were Sean's friends cold war conscientious objectors or was it just that I was ""figured out""? My accountant says that it's best to go with low-risk stocks."
ARRIED GUY	That depends.
SAMANTHA	"What are your expectations? Well, I'm not sure."
ARRIED WOMAN2	"Honey, I need you to come over here and meet someone."
ARRIED GUY	Sure.
ARRIED GUY	This is Samantha.
ARRIED GUY	"Samantha, this is Elaine."
ELAINE	His wife.
ELAINE	"Honey, I really need you in the other room."
ARRIED GUY	Sure.
ARRIED GUY	"It was nice talking to you, Samantha."
SEAN	And this is the den.
CHARLOTTE	"Oh, you have one of these leather club chairs."
CHARLOTTE	I love these.
SEAN	Thanks.
SEAN	I'm using this room as an office now but someday this is gonna be the kid's room.
SEAN	Look.
SEAN	I got this three years ago in Aspen.
CARRIE	"What do you think? Okay, I owe you."
CARRIE	I didn't know that all his buddies were gonna be married.
SAMANTHA	"Oh, my God."
CARRIE	You're doing tequila shots? You see that buddy over there? I fucked him.
SAMANTHA	See that buddy over there? I fucked him too.
SAMANTHA	I never thought I'd see them again.
CARRIE	Maybe we should start tagging your married men and that way you can keep track of them.
CHARLOTTE	He's gonna ask you to marry him.
CARRIE	he is not.
CARRIE	I've been dating him a week and a half.
CHARLOTTE	No guy buys a classic six on the Upper West Side unless they are seriously thinking about marriage.
CARRIE	Some people read palms.
CARRIE	Charlotte read real estate.
SAMANTHA	If you turn into one of those married assholes I'll kill you.
ELAINE	"Sean is the greatest guy, and he love kids."
ARRIED GUY	"Plus, he owns his own business, and he's got 300,000 in the bank."
SEAN EX 1 	"We both slept with him, and he is great in bed."
CARRIE	An hour and a half into this housewarming I had gone from party guest to prisoner of war.
CHARLOTTE	Samantha is totally drunk.
CHARLOTTE	I've gotta get her out of here.
CARRIE	You're not going anywhere without me.
PATIENCE	Carrie.
CARRIE	"Oh, God."
CARRIE	More friends.
PATIENCE	Surprise! It certainly was.
CARRIE	"Last time I saw Patience, she was shoving me on a bus."
PATIENCE	"When Sean told us you and he were dating, we were so thrilled."
CARRIE	Oh.
CARRIE	"Well, listen."
CARRIE	About what happened at your beach house-Don't mention it.
PATIENCE	I just-I'm not even sure-I said don't mention it.
SAMANTHA	This party is terrible.
SAMANTHA	Who are you?
CARRIE	"This is my friend Patience, and this is her husband Peter."
SAMANTHA	I heard about you.
SAMANTHA	"Big pepper mill dick! And just as suddenly, our little cease-fire was over."
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, across town things were winding down."
IRANDA	Thank you so much.
IRANDA	We really had a great time.
CHIP	As did we all.
CHIP	She is a real find.
CHIP	We'll do it again soon.
IRANDA	"I'll meet you at the elevator, okay? I need to-We can't do it again soon."
CHIP	Syd and I aren't really a couple.
CHIP	"In fact, we're not even really lesbians."
IRANDA	"Well, Syd is."
IRANDA	I'm not.
IRANDA	I just took advantage of the situation to bend your ear about my work at the firm.
CHIP	"Shrewd move, Counselor."
CHIP'	No harm done.
IRANDA	"Thank You, sir."
IRANDA	My wife will be disappointed.
CHIP	She was looking to add a lesbian couple to our circle.
CARRIE	As they rode between floors Miranda considered how much easier her life would be if she were in a couple.
CARRIE	Any couple.
IRANDA	Yep.
IRANDA	Definitely straight.
SYD	Yeah.
SYD	You are.
IRANDA	Sorry.
CARRIE	While Miranda cursed her heterosexuality and wondered how much longer she could fight the war Charlotte cursed tequila and forced Samantha into a cab.
CARRIE	She decided Samantha was too drunk to get home alone and insisted she spend the night on her couch.
DOOR MAN	Let me get that door for you.
CHARLOTTE	All Right.
SAMANTHA	I like him.
CARRIE	She got Samantha upstairs and safely to bed.
CARRIE	Or so she thought.
CARRIE	"A couple of hours later, Samantha woke up still drunk and still single."
CARRIE	And single to Samantha meant one thing.
SAMANTHA	Can I have a cigarette?
DOOR MAN	Sure.
SAMANTHA	Can I have a kiss? Jesus.
DOOR MAN	I really shouldn't.
DOOR MAN	Somebody might see.
SAMANTHA	"Why don't you come upstairs, just for a minute? Don't be scared, miss."
SAMANTHA	"It's me, Tommy."
DOOR MAN	I'm just leaving.
DOOR MAN	Your friend invited me up.
DOOR MAN	I know it was wrong.
DOOR MAN	But I've been so lonely since I left home and I wanted the feel of a woman's touch on me.
CHARLOTTE	"I'm going into the bathroom now and when I come out, you won't be here."
CHARLOTTE	And I never want this mentioned again.
DOOR MAN	"Let me get the door for you, miss."
SEAN	I was hoping you'd stay over.
CARRIE	"Look, Sean I don't think this is gonna work."
CARRIE	We want different things.
CARRIE	You obviously want to get married and I don't know what I want.
SEAN	"You could smell my desperation, right? It's just-I was trying you on."
CARRIE	You know? See if it fit.
CARRIE	It doesn't.
CARRIE	I'm sorry.
SEAN	I don't understand you women.
SEAN	"All I hear is ""I want to get married."
SEAN	""" And none of you says yes."
SEAN	What the fuck? I'm so tired of going through women.
SEAN	I just want to get married.
CARRIE	I may know someone who's perfect for you.
CARRIE	"Who? They started out casual-a brunch here, a concert there."
CARRIE	But pretty soon they were visiting china.
SEAN	I always wanted this pattern for formal dining.
CHARLOTTE	Are you serious?
CARRIE	Charlotte broke it off then and there.
CARRIE	It would never work.
CARRIE	He was American Classic; she was French Country.
DOOR MAN	Your friend never called like she promised.
DOOR MAN	Why is that? -
CHARLOTTE	I don't know.
CARRIE	As I sifted through the rubble of my marriage skirmish I had a thought.
CARRIE	Maybe the fight between marrieds and singles is like the war in Northern lreland.
CARRIE	We're all basically the same but somehow we wound up on different sides.
CARRIE	"Sure, it'd be great to have that one special person to walk home with but sometimes there's nothing better than meeting your single girlfriends for a night at the movies."
CARRIE	Once upon a time in a kingdom far away a certain man and a slightly less certain woman kept bumping into one another.
CARRIE	They seemed to meet everywhere.
CARRIE	On street corners at parties.
CARRIE	It was almost as if they were dating accidentally.
CARRIE	"And then, after another chance meeting at a wealthy lawyer's new son's Bris they decided to pick a time to bump into each other on purpose."
CARRIE	"Saturday, 10:30."
CARRIE	The hottest new restaurant in Manhattan.
CARRIE	Samantha's P.
CARRIE	R.
CARRIE	firm was handling the opening.
CHARLOTTE	"So, isn't Brian great?"
CARRIE	Charlotte had a new boyfriend.
CARRIE	"He had her big three: Iooks, manners, money."
CHARLOTTE	Did I tell you he wants to buy a painting from my gallery?
CARRIE	Love and a commission.
CARRIE	She couldn't have been happier.
CARRIE	It's official.
CARRIE	He's late.
CHARLOTTE	Who? Mr.
IRANDA	"Big, who else? Carrie, that's great."
CHARLOTTE	Is it a date?
CARRIE	He called it a thing.
CARRIE	"He said, ""Meet me-Meet me for a drink thing."
CARRIE	""" He never used the ""D"" word."
CHARLOTTE	"Well, ""thing"" is good."
CHARLOTTE	"I mean, ""thing"" comes before date."
CARRIE	Let's hope so.
CARRIE	I'm gonna go in.
CHARLOTTE	Okay.
CHARLOTTE	see You in there.
IRANDA	where did Skipper go?
CHARLOTTE	I don't know how you can date that younger guy.
CHARLOTTE	They're so scattered and unfocused.
IRANDA	We're not dating.
IRANDA	"It's a ""fuck"" thing."
SAMANTHA	"Girls, isn't this fun? I've turned away 20 so far."
SAMANTHA	People are actually crying.
CARRIE	"Oh, something came up."
CARRIE	He's not gonna meet me.
CARRIE	"Here, will you listen to this and tell me if you can figure out whether he's not meeting me as a date or as a friend."
IRANDA	All right.
CARRIE	"Sometimes you need a second opinion with doctors, real estate, men."
IRANDA	Well? I have no idea.
IRANDA	And I finished first in my litigation class.
CARRIE	How pathetic do I feel asking you if a guy kind of likes me? There you are.
SAMANTHA	"Carrie, Miranda this is the hottest chef in New York, Jon."
CARRIE	Jon.
CARRIE	J-O-N.
CARRIE	"No ""H,"" no last name."
CARRIE	"His blue crab strudel was so fabulous, he didn't need one."
SAMANTHA	And this is his very cute friend Sam.
CARRIE	Sam? Who's named Sam? Me.
SAM 	Can I get you a drink?
CARRIE	"Oh, good luck."
CARRIE	The bar is packed.
SAMANTHA	"No problem, 'cause the bartender's a buddy of mine."
SAMANTHA	Miranda? Martini.
CARRIE	"Twenty-something guys always know the really important ""B"" people."
CARRIE	"Busboys, bouncers."
CARRIE	"Plus, they have cute butts."
JON	That's the Times critic.
JON	I'd better go.
SAMANTHA	Did I mention I'm sleeping with him?
IRANDA	Skipper! He's lost.
IRANDA	We gotta get him.
SKIPPER	"They stopped making martinis, so I got us two rum and Cokes."
SKIPPER	Is that okay?
IRANDA	"Well, I hate rum and I hate Coke.But Thanks."
SAM	"Martinis, ladies."
CARRIE	look at you.
SAM	I was a waiter at TGIF.
CARRIE	Fabulous.
CARRIE	They liked each other immediately.
SAM	"You wanna see something? Can you narrow that down a little bit? Wait, I didn't-No fair."
CARRIE	Do it over.
CARRIE	It's you.
BIG	I've been looking all over for you.
BIG	"Here you are, holding a tongue."
CARRIE	"Well, your message said you weren't coming."
BIG	I thought I said I'd try to make it for an hour.
BIG	"Yeah, but then you said that-What did I say? Never mind."
CARRIE	"You're here, you have an hour."
CARRIE	Let's have a drink.
BIG	"I was outside trying to get in for 30 minutes inside looking for you for 20, leaving me with just enough time to tell you that I'm out of time."
BIG	You have fun.
CARRIE	"Men in their 40s are like the New York Times Sunday crossword puzzle: tricky, complicated and you're never really sure you've got the right answer."
SAM	This place is tired.
SAM	do You want to get out Of here? Sure.
CARRIE	"Why not? A short cab ride later Samantha, Jon ""no ""H"", Sam and l found ourselves at the nearby twenty-something club."
CARRIE	I can't believe you made Jon leave his own opening.
SAMANTHA	He is way too happening to be seen someplace borderline tired.
CARRIE	It was a tough town.
CARRIE	Hot places had the life span of a medfly.
CARRIE	"Samantha, everybody in here is in their 20s."
SAMANTHA	And so are we.
CARRIE	"As I glanced around the room, I was amazed at the wide variety of great twenty-something guys."
CARRIE	The groovy guy.
CARRIE	The corporate guy.
CARRIE	The jock guy.
CARRIE	The underage guy.
CARRIE	There you are.
SAM	How are you? I see you found us.
SAM	big couch.
CARRIE	"Oh, here."
SAM	That'll work.
CARRIE	"I'm not too heavy, am l? Right."
SAM	"You weigh, like, nothing."
CARRIE	What's cuter than that? As we took a swig from our pony-necked beers I remembered another type of twenty-something guy.
CARRIE	"So, what's it like to kiss with that thing in? The really good kisser guy."
SAM	You wanna find out?
SAMANTHA	Hello? I am so fucked.
CARRIE	"What's wrong? No, I mean, literally."
SAMANTHA	I have been fucked every way you can be fucked.
CARRIE	"If you keep talking like that, I'm gonna charge you by the minute."
CARRIE	"As I searched for my morning Marlboro Light Samantha proceeded to give me a rundown of her night with Jon-no ""H,"" no inhibitions."
SAMANTHA	"We did it with him on top, me on top, me on my side."
CARRIE	Him on his side?
SAMANTHA	"Oh, God, yes."
SAMANTHA	"On his back, on his side, on his face."
SAM	have You ever done that? I
CARRIE	t's too early to remember.
SAMANTHA	"Well, do it immediately."
SAMANTHA	It is fabulous.
SAMANTHA	"These guys in their twenties, they are up for anything."
SAMANTHA	How did it go with you and Sam?
CARRIE	We kissed.
SAMANTHA	Just kissed? no.
CARRIE	"We just kissed for five hours at the club, in front of the club, on the corner of the club."
CARRIE	"I forgot how much fun it is to just kiss, you know even if I did only get two hours sleep."
SAMANTHA	I didn't sleep at all.
CARRIE	As Samantha went on about her sexual escapades I glanced down at my arm.
CARRIE	There it was in Bic blue-twenty-something Sam's phone number.
CARRIE	"I had this sudden urge to call, but I'd just left him."
CARRIE	"Hell, my lips were still swollen."
CARRIE	"Why this sudden craving? Are men in their twenties the new designer drug? Yes, Samantha, Miranda and I were all recreational users but were we getting into something we couldn't handle? Okay, we were attracted to younger men for various reasons."
CARRIE	But I couldn't help but wonder: What do they see in us? Women in their thirties are just so grateful.
JAKE	It's like every bullshit nice thing you do is like throwing food to the starving.
RICH	Take your shot! They give great head and know a lot about wine.
TIM	They remind me of my mom.
SKIPPER	"They know who they are and what they want, and I like that."
FRED	Fuck! Two words: smart pussy.
CARRIE	"Later that week, Miranda and I compared notes."
CARRIE	Shouldn't we be dating men our own age? Good luck finding one.
IRANDA	There are no available men in their thirties in New York.
IRANDA	Giuliani had them removed along with the homeless.
CARRIE	Then what's really going on here? ls it younger men feel safer? What's really going on here is sex.
IRANDA	"Good old-fashioned, eager-to-please do-what-l-tell-you-to, Eagle Scout sex."
CARRIE	But I'm not having sex.
CARRIE	It's a kissing thing.
IRANDA	So what's the big deal? It's just a fling.
CARRIE	It's not like we're throwing out our schedules or anything.
CARRIE	"Oh, sweetie, I gotta go."
CARRIE	Yeah? I'm late for a meeting with my editor.
CARRIE	Bye! I didn't wanna tell her I cancelled lunch with my editor to go to Banana Republic and help twenty-something Sam pick out a shirt.
CARRIE	Here.
CARRIE	"As I helped him try them on, I thought ""He's sweet, he's fun, and I think he likes me."
CARRIE	"Could he be more than a fling? Could he be a potential boyfriend?"" Please."
STORE WORKER	This isn't the Gap.
CARRIE	"And speaking of potential boyfriends Iater that week the ""crossword puzzle"" asked me to meet him for a drink, blank."
CARRIE	"Not quite a date, five letters, starts with a ""T""."
CARRIE	"Whoever this is, I can't talk."
CARRIE	I'm late for a drink thing.
CARRIE	I just need five minutes.
CHARLOTTE	I'm meeting Brian later and don't know what to do.
CARRIE	"About what? Well, last night after a movie, we're walking down Second Avenue and just passed-Four minutes, Charlotte."
CHARLOTTE	I can't just blurt out what he asked me.
CHARLOTTE	It's embarrassing.
CARRIE	What did the perfect boyfriend ask?
CARRIE	Meet me in front of your apartment in ten minutes.
CARRIE	"Okay, words are essential."
CARRIE	Tell me exactly how he worded it.
CHARLOTTE	"""We've been seeing each other for a couple of weeks."
CHARLOTTE	I really like you.
CHARLOTTE	And tomorrow night after dinner I want us to have anal sex.
CARRIE	"Okay, next stop is gonna be 62nd and Madison? We're picking up Miranda."
CHARLOTTE	"No, God, no."
CARRIE	Yes.
CARRIE	And then we're picking up Samantha.
CHARLOTTE	"Oh, Carrie, no."
CARRIE	"You need all the girl support you can get, and I'm late for drinks with Big."
CHARLOTTE	"Oh, that's great."
CARRIE	"Even in her state of abject blackness, Charlotte was a dating optimist."
CHARLOTTE	It depends.
IRANDA	How much do you like him? A lot.
CHARLOTTE	"""Dating a few months until somebody better comes along"" a lot or ""marrying and moving to East Hampton"" a lot? I don't know."
CHARLOTTE	I'm not sure.
IRANDA	"Well, you better get sure real quick."
CHARLOTTE	You're scaring me.
CARRIE	Don't scare her.
IRANDA	It's all about control.
IRANDA	"If he goes up there, there's gonna be a shift in power."
IRANDA	Either he'll have the upper hand or you will.
IRANDA	There's a certain camp that believes whoever holds the dick holds the power.
IRANDA	Hello! You're driving.
IRANDA	"The question is if he goes up your butt, will he respect you more or less? That's the issue."
CAB DRIVER	No smoking in cab.
CARRIE	"Sir, we're talking ""up the butt."
CARRIE	""" A cigarette is in order."
SAMANTHA	"Front, back, who cares? A hole is a hole."
IRANDA	Can I quote you? -
SAMANTHA	Don't be so judgmental.
IRANDA	You Could use a little back door.
CHARLOTTE	I'm not a hole.
SAMANTHA	"Honey, we know."
SAMANTHA	All I'm saying is that this is a physical expression that the body was designed to experience.
SAMANTHA	And P.
SAMANTHA	S.
SAMANTHA	", it's fabulous."
CHARLOTTE	What are you talking about? I went to Smith.
SAMANTHA	"Look, I'm just saying, with the right guy and right lubricant-What was that? A preview."
CHARLOTTE	Thanks.
CARRIE	"Well, I can't believe it."
CARRIE	"Same time, same place."
CARRIE	Just you and me.
BIG	"Well, sort of."
BIG	Meet my friend Jack.
CARRIE	"Oh, hi."
CARRIE	How are you? Marvelous.
FRIEND	Going through my second divorce.
FRIEND	Bitch is getting everything the first bitch didn't.
CARRIE	"There he was, right in the middle of my drink thing Mr."
CARRIE	Marvelous.
FRIEND	Jesus.
FRIEND	Look at that beautiful woman.
FRIEND	I'm gonna go ask her to join us for dinner.
FRIEND	Excuse me.
BIG	"He, uh, called me crying."
BIG	Do you forgive me? Here's what.
CARRIE	Why don't you two have a guy's night.
CARRIE	"You know, talk, cry, shoot bear."
CARRIE	I'm way behind on my column anyway.
CARRIE	Here.
CARRIE	Next round on me.
CARRIE	We'll do our thing another time.
BIG	Are you sure?
CARRIE	Abso-fucking-lutely.
CARRIE	I didn't know what I was supposed to feel.
CARRIE	Confused? Sad? Rejected? I decided to walk to clear my head.
CARRIE	"Also, I just left my cab fare on the table."
CARRIE	So I walked.
CARRIE	I walked 48 blocks in four-hundred-dollar shoes.
CARRIE	I just needed something to take the edge off.
CARRIE	A little kiss to make me feel better.
CARRIE	"But now, it wasn't working."
CARRIE	I wasn't getting the same rush.
CARRIE	"Tonight, I needed more."
CARRIE	"Meanwhile uptown, Charlotte wondered when relationships had gotten so complicated."
CARRIE	"She yearned for the time when dinner was followed by dessert, not lubricant."
CHARLOTTE	"I-l can't, Brian."
CHARLOTTE	I can't.
CHARLOTTE	"I want to, but I can't."
CHARLOTTE	"I mean, actually-No, that's not true."
CHARLOTTE	I don't want to.
CHARLOTTE	Or maybe I do.
CHARLOTTE	"I don't know what I want, but I'm afraid if I don't you'll dump me."
CHARLOTTE	"And if I do, then I'll be the ""up the butt"" girl."
CHARLOTTE	"I don't wanna be the ""up the butt"" girl."
CHARLOTTE	"Men don't marry the ""up the butt"" girl."
CHARLOTTE	Whoever heard of Mrs.
CHARLOTTE	"Up The Butt? No, no, no."
CHARLOTTE	I can't.
CHARLOTTE	I want children and nice bedding and I just can't handle this right now.
BRIAN	Can we fuck the regular way?
CHARLOTTE	"Yes, please."
CARRIE	"That night, they made love the Charlotte way-polite and respectful on 300-count Egyptian cotton sheets."
CARRIE	Meanwhile downtown-That was really great.
JON	You know when you lay like that you have the cutest little wrinkles in your neck.
CARRIE	Samantha realized as long as she dated someone younger she would always be older.
CARRIE	She gave up twenty-somethings right then and there.
CARRIE	As Samantha went cold turkey I got in deeper and deeper.
CARRIE	That was- totally awesome.
CARRIE	I was hooked.
CARRIE	Gone.
CARRIE	"Who cares about age, crossword puzzles the cab money I'd left on the table? This felt so good, I'd do anything to keep this high."
CARRIE	And just when I thought I couldn't get any higher he spooned me.
CARRIE	"I woke up wanting more, or maybe not."
CARRIE	"In the gray morning light, everything looked completely different."
CARRIE	"Candles from Urban Outfitter, dirty laundry, a pizza box."
CARRIE	"Suddenly, reality hit."
CARRIE	I'm in a twenty-something apartment.
SAM	"good morning, babe."
CARRIE	good morning.
SAM	Fuck! I had this amazing dream.
CARRIE	"My father and my ex-girlfriend were, like, dead or something."
SAM	How are you doing? It's good to see you.
CARRIE	coffee.
CARRIE	I need coffee.
SAM	It's in the kitchen.
SAM	"And I had these big hands, like big aluminum hands."
SAM'	"And I lived in this, like, big missile silo that was totally nuclear, and it was surrounded by, like, my enemies and shit."
SAM	"And one by one, they'd run at me! They got inside somehow."
SAM	"I don't remember, but they would, like, run at me and I would crush them to pieces with my big aluminum hands."
SAM	I crushed this one guy.
SAM	He had no face and stuff but I crushed him.
SAM	"I could crush anything with these big fucking hands, man."
CARRIE	You don't have any coffee-You don't have any coffee filters.
SAM	I'll make that.
CARRIE	That's all right.
SAM	Oh! You were in the dream as this beautiful unicorn woman with glass eyes.
CARRIE	"You, coffee."
CARRIE	"Me, bathroom."
SAM	"That would make a kick-ass song, wouldn't it? Unicorn woman Coffee."
SAM	"Oh, that's my roommate."
CARRIE	"Every fiber in my thirty-something being was screaming ""Get out! You're too old for this."
CARRIE	""" And just when I thought I couldn't sink any lower-I need toilet paper!"
SAM	I'm just using the last of it to make the coffee.
CARRIE	I decided the only way to break free was to move from one addiction to an even bigger one.
CARRIE	Shoes.
CARRIE	A couple of blocks and way too much money later I realized I had just entered an interesting chapter in my life.
CARRIE	I had outgrown the boys of my past and not quite grown into the men of my future.
FRIEND 	Hi.
CARRIE	How are you?
CARRIE	Why is it in a city of ten million men you always see the one you don't want and never see the one you-What are you doing down there?
BIG	It's a wobbly table.Guess I have the touch.
BIG	Would you care to join us?
CARRIE	Hinge.
BIG	what?
CARRIE	your crossword puzzle.
CA	Five-letter word.
CARRIE	"""To bring together."
CARRIE	""" Hinge."
CARRIE	Nice seeing you.
BIG	Bye.
CARRIE	Bye.
BIG	Excuse me.
BIG	"Hey, just so you know, I would've gotten hinge on my own."
BIG	Maybe.
CARRIE	I have No doubt.
BIG	"Now that I've got Jack hooked up, I'm single again."
BIG	Maybe we could have dinner sometime.
CARRIE	I don't know.
BIG	I'm good at crossword puzzles.
BIG	I'm just not so good at people puzzles.
CARRIE	Anywhere you want.
BIG	Just you and me.
CARRIE	Call me.
CARRIE	"As I walked away, I had a thought: Maybe all men are a drug."
CARRIE	"Sometimes they bring you down and sometimes, like now, they get you so high."
CARRIE	Damn.
CARRIE	It would've been so cool if I hadn't looked back.
CARRIE	The most powerful woman in New York is not Tina Brown or Diane Sawyer or even Rosie O'Donnell.
CARRIE	It's the hostess at Balzac-which had overnight become the only restaurant that mattered.
CARRIE	And we were there to celebrate the moment.
SAMANTHA	This is humiliating.
SAMANTHA	We've been waiting f or 45 minutes.
CARRIE	I think I'm gonna f aint.
SAMANTHA	Doesn't she know who we are? -
CARRIE	Who are we?
SAMANTHA	I own my own PR firm.You write a newspaper column.
SAMANTHA	This should not be happening.
SAMANTHA	I'm going back up there.
SAMANTHA	Excuse me.
SAMANTHA	Hello.
SAMANTHA	Excuse me.
SAMANTHA	Hello! We've been waiting 45 minutes.
SAMANTHA	"Look, I'm not sure you understand but I'm kind of somebody and she's definitely kind of somebody and we really need to eat now."
HOSTESS	I'm sorry.
SAMANTHA	Excuse me.
SAMANTHA	Give me a 20.
CARRIE	You must be joking.
CARRIE	Do you think I should make it a 50?
CARRIE	"If I had $50 with me, do you think I'd give it to that girl?"
SAMANTHA	She cannot do this to us.
SAMANTHA	We're leaving.
CARRIE	"Oh, god."
SAMANTHA	Let me tell you something.
SAMANTHA	I was that woman ten years ago but I wielded my power in a benevolent manner.
CARRIE	Can we please talk about this over lunch somewhere else?
SAMANTHA	"Where, somewhere like New Jersey, where we might actually get seated? Do you realize, if she were a man, not only would we be eating now but they'd be sending over free drinks."
CARRIE	I know a great Thai place around the corner where the owner's son practically always sends over a complementary order of mee krob.
SAMANTHA	How sad.
SAMANTHA	"Do you think we can get it to go? A short time later, Samantha headed back to her office while I decided to investigate this theory I had about shopping as a way"
CARRIE	"A short time later, Samantha headed back to her office while I decided to investigate this theory I had about shopping as a way to unleash the creative subconscious. to unleash the cre"
CARRIE	All right.
CARRIE	I'm gonna take them.
CARRIE	I was already planning on returning them when-
STORE CLERK	Miss? They told me to do that.
STORE CLERK	And now they want to talk to you.
CARRIE	That won't be necessary.
CARRIE	"Oh, my God! I don't believe it! When did you get to town? Just yesterday."
AMALITA	"Darling, You look fantastic."
CARRIE	I can't let you do this.
AMALITA	Of course you can.
AMALITA	And you can pay me back never.
AMALITA	"Besides, it's on Carlo."
CARRIE	Wow.
AMALITA	When did you two-About two months.
AMALITA	His family has this gigantic ranch in Argentina.
AMALITA	"Very, very wealthy."
AMALITA	"He has a tiny little penis, but he knows exactly how to use it."
AMALITA	"Wave, darling."
AMALITA	Wave.
AMALITA	"Ciao, ciao, ciao."
CARRIE	"That's very nice of you, but I just can't accept these."
AMALITA	But of course you can.
AMALITA	"When have I ever given you a birthday present or a Christmas present? I mean, you are like a sister to me yet I never see you."
CARRIE	"The truth was, we'd only met a f ew times."
CARRIE	Most people would classify Amalita as Eurotrash.
CARRIE	I thought she was fun.
AMALITA	So call me.
AMALITA	I'm staying at the Four Seasons with Carlo.
CARRIE	Don't you live in the city? I'm a citizen of the world.
AMALITA	"A citizen of the world, darling."
AMALITA	"Now take the shoes, and we'll talk soon."
CARRIE	I can't do this.
AMALITA	Of course You can.
AAM	"Go, go."
CARRIE	Thank you.
AMALITA	I couldn't understand a word she was saying but I f elt I had in my possession all the ltalian I'd ever need to know.
CARRIE	"While at home, all the English I seemed to encounter was ""bills, bills, bills."
CARRIE	""" I envied Amalita."
CARRIE	"Her lif e was a blur of rich men, designer clothes and glamorous resorts."
CARRIE	"She didn't actually work f or a living, yet possessed a dazzling sexual power that she exploited to her full advantage."
CARRIE	Which presented a certain conundrum.
CARRIE	Where's the line between prof essional girlfriend and just plain prof essional? Women have the right to use every means at their disposal to achieve power.
SAMANTHA	Short of sleeping their way to the top.
IRANDA	Not if that's what it takes to compete.
CHARLOTTE	But that's exploitation!
SAMANTHA	Of men-which is perf ectly legal.
CARRIE	Saturday night.
CARRIE	In an eff ort to save money and maybe even pick up a f ew extra bucks I invited the girls over f or poker.
CHARLOTTE	I'll buy two.
CARRIE	I'm in f or three.
CARRIE	So you advocate a double standard.
CARRIE	Women can use their sexuality to get ahead whenever possible but men should not be allowed to take advantage of it? I'm just saying that men and women are equal-opportunity exploiters.
IRANDA	I f old.
CARRIE	What if You sense That someone is giving You a prof essional advantage because they find You charming? charming? this I gotta hear.
CHARLOTTE	"A f ew days ago, Neville Morgan, the notoriously reclusive painter paid a visit to the gallery."
CARRIE	Neville was making his yearly pilgrimage to Manhattan to check out what was new and hot on the art scene.
CHARLOTTE	And he f ound it-Charlotte.
CARRIE	It was only a matter of moments bef ore he invited her to his f arm upstate to view his latest work.
CHARLOTTE	"If I could get him to show at the gallery, it would be an incredible coup."
CHARLOTTE	"But What if he wants me to, You know."
CARRIE	Hold his brush? If he so much as suggests what she's suggesting you give me a call and we'll sue the hell out of him.
IRANDA	That's the only proper way to trade sex f or power.
SAMANTHA	I can't believe what I'm hearing.
SAMANTHA	You're like the Harvard Law Lorena Bobbitt.
IRANDA	It's Skipper.
IRANDA	I told him I was here.
IRANDA	"He insisted on picking me up, but he's not supposed to be here till 11:00."
CARRIE	He's like a sweet little seal pup.
IRANDA	That you sometimes want to club.
IRANDA	You're an hour early.
SKIPPER	I can wait in the hall.
CARRIE	"Skipper, come in."
IRANDA	It's all right.
IRANDA	I'm leaving anyway.
IRANDA	You guys have cleaned me out.
IRANDA	"Good night, ladies."
IRANDA	Keep me posted.
CARRIE	"A couple of hours later, I was looking f orward to calling it an early night, when"
AMALITA	"Hello? Carrie, you bitch! What are you doing? -"
CARRIE	I'm getting ready to go to sleep.
AMALITA	"Why don't you come and join us? We are at Balzac, and there is someone here I am dying f or you to meet."
CARRIE	"I'd love to, but I'm really trying to cut back."
CARRIE	"You know, pinch a f ew pennies."
AMALITA	"You are crazy, you know that? Why don't you just come down here and be your f abulous self? The truth was I could barely aff ord that either."
CARRIE	But I rationalized that my new shoes shouldn't be punished just because I can't budget.
HOSTESS	Sorry.
HOSTESS	You're not on the list.
CARRIE	I don't need a list.
CARRIE	My friends are already in.
AMALITA	"Darling, what took you so long? You won't believe what Carlo bought me this afternoon at Van Cleef & Arpels."
CARRIE	"What? Oh, my God, it's gorgeous."
AMALITA	Twelve thousand dollars.
AMALITA	"Listen, I want you to come and meet the world's most f abulous man."
CARRIE	Sounds like a trendy sideshow act.
AMALITA	"You're crazy! Carrie, I'd like you to meet my boyfriend Carlo."
AMALITA	and his friend Gilles.
CARRIE	Hello.
CARLO	Hello.
GILES	Nice to meet you.
AMALITA	Gilles is an architect from Paris.
CARRIE	How long are you here f or? -.
GILES	Just a couple of days
GILES	On business.
AMALITA	I've told Gilles all about you.
AMALITA	I told him you were the most beautiful talented and f ascinating woman in New York.
AMALITA	And single.
GILES	How is this possible? I get it.
CARRIE	You're an architect and a comedian.
GILES	I don't understand.
CARRIE	Nothing.
CARRIE	I'm just being un peu stupide.
GILES	You? Never.
CARRIE	I suddenly recalled my terrible weakness f or gorgeous French architects.
GILES	Can I get anyone something else? You would like another bottle of wine? Wonderful.
CARRIE	And what will the rest of you be having?
CARRIE	"During the next couple of hours, I put my journalistic skills to good use."
CARRIE	"I discovered that Gilles was recently divorced with a five-year-old daughter, Beatrice who lived with her mother in Paris."
CARRIE	He was passing through New York on his way to Brazil to supervise construction of a new hotel.
CARRIE	I think you are too beautiful to be a writer.
CARRIE	I think you're too charming to be an architect.
GILES	I think you should give up your lif e here and move with me to Paris immediately.
CARRIE	I thought you were spending the next six months in Brazil.
GILES	You can join me there first.
CARRIE	Don't tempt me.
CARRIE	I'm so broke these days I might take you up on that off er just to save on rent.
GILES	"Writing does not pay well? No, it does."
CARRIE	"It's just, I have this little substance abuse problem."
CARRIE	Expensive f ootwear.
GILES	I see.
GILES	I'm only here f or the weekend but I would love to see you tomorrow.
GILES	Maybe you could show me the town.
GILES	You've never been to New York? About 12 times but I've never seen it with someone like you.
CARRIE	"You really have that certain je ne sais quoi, don't you? Yes."
GILES	And so do you.
CARRIE	"So, I'll see you tomorrow."
GILES	Good night.
CARRIE	"Sure, I saw some red flags-divorced, French and almost uncomf ortably handsome-but I f elt like I was floating on air."
CARRIE	"The next morning I was brought back down to Earth as I confronted that eternal puzzle a closet full of clothes, nothing to wear."
CARRIE	Just a minute! Who is it? Hey.
CARRIE	Hey.
SKIPPER	I'm sorry.
SKIPPER	I should go.
CARRIE	"Skipper, come on in."
SKIPPER	What is it? It's Miranda.
SKIPPER	She's got me totally whacked.
SKIPPER	It's like I'm obsessed.
SKIPPER	And I know that I shouldn't be because I can sense that it's totally turning her off.
SKIPPER	But I can't control it.
SKIPPER	I can't.
SKIPPER	It's like she's got this power over me and I'm helpless.
CARRIE	Keep going.
CARRIE	"I have to get dressed, all right? Is it possible to be addicted to a person? The sex is so awesome that it's, like it's all I can think about."
SKIPPER	I've never considered myself a horn dog bef ore but I'm worried I might be starting to scare her off.
CARRIE	"Well, is that what she said?"
SKIPPER	"No, but mostly we just have sex in the afternoon."
SKIPPER	She never lets me spend the night.
CARRIE	"Well, I have an idea."
CARRIE	Why don't the two of you just spend a night together and not have sex? That would be hard.
SKIPPER	That would be really hard.
CARRIE	"Well, I think it's really important that you try."
SKIPPER	I don't even shower afterwards.
SKIPPER	I like to spend the whole day smelling like Miranda.
CARRIE	I began to f ear that Miranda's sexuality was overpowering poor Skipper.
CARRIE	Later I spent the most incredibly romantic afternoon with Gilles.
CARRIE	I f elt like I had landed in a Claude Lelouch film-A Man and a Slightly Neurotic Woman.
CARRIE	Wait.
CARRIE	Wait.
CARRIE	I kind of have this rule.
CARRIE	I don't sleep with men I've only known a day.
GILES	I see.
CARRIE	I gave in.
CARRIE	"After all, it was already tomorrow in Paris."
GILES	You look so beautiful when you sleep.
GILES	I didn't want to disturb you.
CARRIE	Are you leaving so early? -
GILES	I've got a plane.
CARRIE	I'll get up.
GILES	Stay in bed.
GILES	Order room service.
GILES	Enjoy yourself.
CARRIE	I can Just get dressed.
GILES	Relax.
GILES	I'll call you.
CARRIE	Okay.
GILES	"As he walked out the door, it suddenly dawned on me that he didn't have my phone number."
GILES	And I didn't have his phone number.
CARRIE	"But he had left me a note with $1,000 in cash."
CARRIE	"""Thanks f or the beautiful day."
IRANDA	""" Must have been a hell of a beautiful day."
CARRIE	"Well, it was."
CARRIE	We had such a f antastic connection.
CARRIE	Then he leaves me money.
CARRIE	I don't understand.
CARRIE	"What exactly about me screams ""whore""? I just can't believe that you had dinner at Balzac."
IRANDA	"Besides the $1,000 on the end table?"
SAMANTHA	Wait a minute.
SAMANTHA	I thought I ordered two eggs benedict and one spinach omelette.
IRANDA	It's all right.
IRANDA	I'll take the omelette.
CARRIE	This isn't right.
CARRIE	"We're gonna pay f or all this ourselves, all right? He said order anything."
IRANDA	"The room service is one thing, but the money-uh-uh."
SAMANTHA	What are you getting so uptight about? Money is power.
SAMANTHA	Sex is power.
SAMANTHA	"Theref ore, getting money f or sex is simply an exchange of power."
IRANDA	Don't listen to the dime store Camille Paglia.
CARRIE	I don't know whether to take it as an incredible compliment or as an incredible insult.
SAMANTHA	"Just take it, period."
CARRIE	I wouldn't know how to return it anyway because he didn't leave me his number.
IRANDA	He paid in full.
IRANDA	"What more is there to talk about? Who is this Amalita Amalfi character, anyway? I'm concerned that you've been drafted into a ring of high-class hookers."
CARRIE	She isn't a hooker.
CARRIE	She's-She's like an international party girl.
IRANDA	She's a hooker with a passport.
IRANDA	Do you ever have any conversations about money?
CARRIE	I did allude to the f act that I was a bit cash poor these days.
IRANDA	So maybe it's supposed to be a loan? I don't remember filling out an application.
SAMANTHA	"Sweetheart, men give, women receive."
SAMANTHA	It's biological destiny.
IRANDA	Do you really want to say that? That's the argument men have used since the dawn of time to exploit women.
CARRIE	I'm just gonna write the whole thing off as a bad date with a cash bonus.
IRANDA	"You know, that salmon is really good."
IRANDA	I think we should order another one.
CARRIE	As I struggled with the dilemma of how to manage my newf ound money Charlotte arrived at the secluded Connecticut home of the painter Neville Morgan in an attempt to secure his latest work.
NEVILLE	Welcome.
CHARLOTTE	Hi.
CHARLOTTE	I f eel so privileged.
CHARLOTTE	Meeting you is without a doubt the high point of my career.
NEVILLE	Thank you.
NEVILLE	I'm frankly surprised that someone as young as you is even familiar with my work.
CHARLOTTE	Are you serious? I studied you in college.
NEVILLE	"Oh, my God."
NEVILLE	I apologize.
NEVILLE	I really do.
CHARLOTTE	You're much too modest.
NEVILLE	Here we are.
NEVILLE	Excuse me.
NEVILLE	The canvasses you're about to see are what I consider to be the apotheosis of every great idea I've ever had.
NEVILLE	"It's the closest I've ever come to pure, universal God f orce."
NEVILLE	The cunt.
CHARLOTTE	"Oh, my."
CHARLOTTE	They're very powerful.
NEVILLE	Exactly.
NEVILLE	The most powerful f orce in the universe.
NEVILLE	The source of all lif e and pleasure and beauty.
CHARLOTTE	That's true.
NEVILLE	I used to paint full nudes but as I got older I realized that the truth was to be f ound only in the cunt.
CARRIE	"Charlotte hated the ""C"" word."
CARRIE	But Neville Morgan was not a man to be corrected.
NEVILLE WIFE	Hi.
NEVILLE WIFE	I thought you might like something to drink.
NEVILLE	"Charlotte, this is my wif e, Gertrude."
GERTRUDE	It's a pleasure.
GERTRUDE	Lemonade and cookies? Thank you.
NEVILLE	Each of these portraits is of a woman who has touched my lif e.
CHARLOTTE	Incredible.
NEVILLE	I wonder would you consider posing f or me sometime?
CHARLOTTE	Me? l-Well I'm very flattered.
NEVILLE	Excellent.
NEVILLE	"So long as you're here, I could sketch you this afternoon."
GERTRUDE	"I bet you have a beautiful cunt, dear."
CARRIE	As Charlotte pondered how f ar she would go f or her love of art and the gallery-Another Saturday night.
CARRIE	With my hooker money still burning a hole in my pocket Samantha and I showed up at Balzac.
CARRIE	She reasoned that since I was there once I was as good as in.
SAMANTHA	I don't understand.
SAMANTHA	"I made these reservations weeks ago, and she's already been here."
HOSTESS	I'm sorry.
SAMANTHA	Is there a host that I might talk to? I will snap her.
SAMANTHA	"I will put her over my knee, and I will snap her like a twig."
CARRIE	I'm sorry.
CARRIE	I'm hungry.
CARRIE	"I'm going to go to the bathroom, and then we're leaving, all right? Come here! They all looked so chic and glamorous."
CARRIE	Part of me wanted to grab Samantha and make a run f or it.
CARRIE	While another part-
CARRIE	Hi.
AMALITA	"How are you? Carrie, I want you to meet Mario Allen, Justine and Peter."
AMALITA	Mario's f amily has one of those gorgeous palazzos on the Grand Canal in Venezia.
AMALITA	And we are all going there next week f or the film f estival.
ARIO	You should join us.
AMALITA	"Absolutely!Yes, You must bring your little laptop And write All about it."
AMALITA	You'd be mad not to go.
AMALITA	Carrie is one of the most f ascinating talented and beautiful women in New York.
ARIO	I have no doubt.
CARRIE	I've never been to Venice.
ARIO	"Venice is the most beautiful, the most romantic city in the world."
CARRIE	Really? I heard it was sinking.
ARIO	That's why you must come immediately- bef ore it's all gone.
CARRIE	I couldn't say I wasn't tempted.
CARRIE	I realized that I could leverage myself Iike the human equivalent of a sexy junk bond.
CARRIE	"I'd parlay that $1,000 into a trip to Venice into a nice piece of jewelry a rich husband, f ollowed by a richer divorce."
CARRIE	I'm sorry.
CARRIE	I'm gonna have to say good-bye.
CARRIE	I'm here with a friend.
CARRIE	She's waiting f or me at the bar.
AMALITA	What a pity.
AMALITA	Call me.
AMALITA	I'm staying at the Carlyle with Peter.
CARRIE	Just because Venice was sinking didn't mean my morals had to go down with it.
CARRIE	"And as f or Gilles and the $1,000 I figured there was nothing to be done."
CARRIE	"For better or worse, I had just established my rate f or a one-night stand."
HOSTESS	Excuse me.
CARRIE	And then the most powerful woman in Manhattan asked me f or a f avor.
HOSTESS	Do you have a tampon?
CARRIE	Of course.Oh! Sure.
HOSTESS	Thanks a lot.
CARRIE	"I never told Samantha the source of my newf ound power but from that moment on, we never had a problem getting a table at Balzac again."
CARRIE	"A couple of weeks later, we were all there to celebrate Charlotte's coup."
IRANDA	Hi.
IRANDA	Excuse me just a second.
IRANDA	"Are you number nine? Oh, my God."
CHARLOTTE	I am so not number nine.
SAMANTHA	Five.
CHARLOTTE	"Yeah, right."
CARRIE	"It's this, right? Really? They say a picture is worth a thousand words but in this case I was speechless."
CARRIE	"Two weeks ago, I had my picture taken."
PHOTOGRAPHER	Look up.
PHOTOGRAPHER	"Good, good."
CARRIE	It was a promotional photo for my column scheduled to run on the side of a bus.
CARRIE	I had misgivings which were somewhat mollified when they told me I could keep the dress.
CARRIE	Friday night.
CARRIE	"In lieu of any actual social life of their own Samantha, Miranda and Charlotte had all stopped by to live vicariously through my first official date with Mr."
CARRIE	Big.
CHARLOTTE	"Carrie! Honey, it's fabulous."
SAMANTHA	Bravo.
IRANDA	"It's tits on toast, baby, but you make it work."
CHARLOTTE	Let's just say it.
CHARLOTTE	It's the naked dress.
IRANDA	You're obviously gonna have sex tonight.
CARRIE	come on.
CARRIE	It's our first date.
IRANDA	She's not gonna have sex.
IRANDA	She's just gonna look like sex.
CARRIE	That's right.
CARRIE	I'm just the trailer.
SAMANTHA	Please.
SAMANTHA	"If it happens, it happens."
SAMANTHA	Bottoms up.
CHARLOTTE	Wait a second.
CHARLOTTE	I thought you were serious about this guy.
CHARLOTTE	You can't sleep with him on the first date.
IRANDA	"Here she goes again with ""The Rules."
SAMANTHA	""" The women who wrote that book wrote it because they couldn't get laid so they constructed this whole bullshit theory to make women who can get laid feel bad."
CHARLOTTE	"But if you're serious about a guy, then you have to keep him in a holding pattern for at least five dates."
CARRIE	You've gone up.
CHARLOTTE	Yes because the Number Of dates You Wait to have sex with a man is directly proportional to your age.
IRANDA	Forget the math.
IRANDA	"Just don't fuck on a first date, you're fine."
CARRIE	Third date.
CHARLOTTE	Too soon.
SAMANTHA	Reality check.
SAMANTHA	A guy can just as easily dump you if you fuck him on the first date as he can if you wait until the tenth.
IRANDA	When have you ever been on a tenth date?
CHARLOTTE	"And by then, at least you're emotionally involved."
SAMANTHA	"I mean, isn't it better to find out if the sex is good right offthe bat before anybody's feelings get hurt?"
CHARLOTTE	It's okay to have hurt feelings.
IRANDA	and You always handle those So well.
CARRIE	"Well, there is something to be said for restraint."
IRANDA	When did you become such a Victorian?
CHARLOTTE	The Victorians were onto something.
CHARLOTTE	They valued romance.
IRANDA	True romance cannot exist without good sex.
SAMANTHA	And yet you can have good sex with someone you don't like or respect or even remember.
CARRIE	All right.
CARRIE	"Well, ladies, I'm just going to dinner."
CARRIE	good night.
CHARLOTTE	Bye! Have fun! Bye!
CARRIE	"The truth is, I was dying to sleep with him but isn't delayed gratification the definition of maturity?"
BIG	Interesting dress.
CARRIE	Meaning?
BIG	Interesting dress.
BIG	Don't worry.
BIG	I'm perfectly capable of restraining myself.
CARRIE	So am l.
CARRIE	I can't be hemmed in by rules.
CARRIE	I go with my emotions.
CARRIE	Some of the greatest romances of all time began with sex on the first date.
CARRIE	I bet.
CARRIE	I will not be the first one to speak.
CARRIE	"And if he never calls me again, I'll always think of him fondly as an asshole."
CARRIE	"That was really- I mean, can you believe we- on the first date? I mean, I didn't plan that, you know? l- What do you think?"
BIG	"What? Ow! I thought it was pretty fuckin' great, but what do I know? You feel like getting some Szechuan? Had Mr."
CARRIE	Big discovered my weakness for great sex and greasy Chinese? Or was going out to dinner simply a diversionary tactic to keep me from spending the night? Before I was able to completely indulge my paranoia it was my pal Mike Singer.
CARRIE	We've known each other for ten years but never had sex because we want to know each other f or another ten years.
IKE	What are you doing here? -
CARRIE	I'm with- I'll tell you later.
IKE	You look great.
CARRIE	Not too naked?
IKE	Just naked enough.
CARRIE	Hi.
CARRIE	I'm Carrie Bradshaw.
CARRIE	I'm an old friend of Mike's.
LIBBY	I'm Libby Biyalick.
LIBBY	It's so nice to finally meet a friend.
IKE	So I'll call ya.
CARRIE	Great.
CARRIE	"Well, have a good dinner."
CARRIE	Nice to meet you.
CARRIE	I left the table wondering why Mike didn't want to introduce me to his date.
CARRIE	"Again! That very same night, something absolutely amazing happened to Miranda."
TRAINER	Really good now.
IRANDA	"Oh, my God! I'm so sorry! I didn't mean- Are you okay? She met someone in gym class."
IRANDA	"Are you- Oh, God."
IRANDA	Are you sure you're okay?
TRAINER	I'm fine.
TRAINER	So what exactly about my head pissed you off? I wish there was something I could do.
TRAINER	"Well, you can buy me dinner sometime and a CAT scan."
CARRIE	His name was Ted Baker.
CARRIE	"He was 32, a sports medicine doctor with an apartment overlooking the Natural History Museum."
CARRIE	"Three prior serious relationships, none resulting in marriage."
IRANDA	Kiss to make it better.
TED	"So, really, can I call you sometime?"
IRANDA	Sure.
IRANDA	He left a message on my machine when I got home.
I	He wants to go out this week.
CARRIE	That's fantastic.
I	no.
IRANDA	It's too quick.
IRANDA	I think maybe that kick in his head scrambled his brains.
CARRIE	No.
CARRIE	Too quick is sleeping with him on the first date.
CARRIE	That's too quick.
IRANDA	"You both got excited, and you went for it."
IRANDA	Stop blaming yourself.
CARRIE	I don't blame myself.
CARRIE	I blame the dress.
CARRIE	The dress.
CARRIE	"The dress led me on, had a lif e of its own."
CARRIE	"Then we went to this Chinese restaurant, and you'll never guess who I ran into."
CARRIE	Mike Singer out on a date.
IRANDA	The whole world's in love.
CARRIE	I'm not sure.
CARRIE	I don't know.
CARRIE	"He was acting very weird, like he- Iike he didn't want me to meet her."
IRANDA	What's her name?
CARRIE	Her name was Libby Biyalick.
CARRIE	"Mike told me everything that afternoon while I helped him pick out sheets at Bed, Bath & Beyond."
CARRIE	So how long have you been seeing her?
IKE	A while.Is this a painful topic?
IKE	No.It's just she's not someone I date openly.
CARRIE	Why? ls she married?
IKE	No.
CARRIE	Is she a cousin?
IKE	No.
IKE	Look.
IKE	"The thing is, she's smart, incredibly sweet, and sex is great."
IKE	She's just not the one I see myself with.
CARRIE	Why not? It was about three months ago.
CARRIE	"Mike had been dumped by Fiona Brooks, a cellist for the Philharmonic who he was trying to forget as quickly as possible."
CARRIE	"They had both loved to cook, and shopping was a Saturday morning ritual."
CARRIE	So he was feeling particularly vulnerable when-
LIBBY	Care to try some aged sheep's milk cheese from the Alps?
IKE	Thanks.
IKE	It's good.
LIBBY	It's made by monks.
IKE	Really?
LIBBY	Trappist monks.
LIBBY	Fresh goat cheese from the Napa Valley.
IKE	It's delicious.
LIBBY	It's a triple cream from France.
CARRIE	Mike found himself very uninhibited.
CARRIE	Since he didn't think Libby was that gorgeous there wasn't any pressure.
CARRIE	"The next morning, he woke up and felt at ease very relaxed."
IKE	I'm a creative director of an ad agency but eventually I'd love to have my own shop.
LIBBY	I'd love to have my own shop too.
LIBBY	"Well, cheese shop, I mean."
CARRIE	She was one of the only women he'd ever met who he felt he could just be with.
CARRIE	So what's the problem? x
IKE	.She's not beautiful and we don't have a lot in common.
IKE	"I mean, most of her friends are in dairy."
IKE	But she's warm and unpretentious and it was the best sex I've ever had in my life.
CARRIE	What are you afraid of? What are other people going to think? All I know is that she's not the right woman for me in the larger sense so I keep her a secret.
CARRIE	I couldn't decide whether Mike was being shallow or honest but the question nagged me for days.
IKE	How many of us out there are having great sex with people we're ashamed to introduce to our friends?
SAMANTHA	Have I ever had fabulous sex with someone I didn't want to admit to? Did I ever tell you about that jazz musician who lived with his mother?
CARRIE	Yeah.
SAMANTHA	Alex.
SAMANTHA	What about the window washer? The one who doesn't wear any underwear? I met this gorgeous kid in Spy Bar last year.
CARRIE	He was- He turned out to be in high school.
CARRIE	"Evidently, Samantha had had lots of sex none of which was secret."
SAMANTHA	Fine.
SAMANTHA	It just proves that I'm not ashamed of anyone I've slept with.
CARRIE	Here it is.
CARRIE	Up here.
SAMANTHA	You look-
CARRIE	Naked.
CARRIE	There It was- the dress That led me down the garden path with Mr.
CARRIE	Big.
CARRIE	I shouldn't be embarrassed? -
SAMANTHA	No.You look fabulous.
SAMANTHA	"Besides, there's no such thing as bad publicity."
CARRIE	Yeah.
CARRIE	You would say that.
CARRIE	You're a publicist.
SAMANTHA	"You know, we need to go someplace absolutely fabulous where we can toast you where the bus goes by."
SAMANTHA	and You can invite Mr.
SAMANTHA	Big.
CARRIE	no.
CARRIE	I don't think so.
CARRIE	I haven't heard from him since we spent the night together.
SAMANTHA	"Sweetie, forget about him."
SAMANTHA	You are going to be on the side of a bus.
SAMANTHA	Ten million men are going to be drooling over you on their way to work.
SAMANTHA	It's the best personal ad I've ever seen in my life.
CARRIE	Samantha had a particular knack for turning a desperate situation into a hopeless one.
SAMANTHA	Speaking of secret sex did Charlotte ever tell you about the rabbi? The rabbi?
CHARLOTTE	I cannot believe the two of you came down here to interrogate me at work.
SAMANTHA	Excuse me? You know who I'm talking about.
CARRIE	I'm sorry.
CARRIE	It's my fault.
CHARLOTTE	"Anyway, he wasn't a rabbi."
CHARLOTTE	He was a Hasidic folk artist from Brooklyn.
SAMANTHA	Close enough.
CARRIE	"Evidently, Charlotte had seen Shmuel's work in an exhibition and scheduled an appointment to meet him at his studio."
CHARLOTTE	These are outstanding.
CHARLOTTE	So much life.
CHARLOTTE	You have a beautiful way with light.
SHMUL	Thank you.
CHARLOTTE	This one is really special.
SHMUL	That's my yeshiva.
SHMUL	I wanted to capture the exuberance of youth.
CARRIE	Charlotte quickly became intoxicated by his talent his strangeness and the smell of his wool.
CHARLOTTE	Magical.
CARRIE	"It was so sexy, so forbidden."
CARRIE	Daddy's little Episcopalian princess in the arms of one of God's chosen people.
CHARLOTTE	So we would talk about art and sex and the Torah.
CARRIE	Why didn't you introduce him to anybody?
CHARLOTTE	"I was embarrassed.I mean, I could really date him, and he couldn't date me."
CHARLOTTE	"I mean, what would people think?"
CHARLOTTE	"Now, you cannot put this in your column."
SAMANTHA	"If the sex is good, who cares what anybody thinks?"
CHARLOTTE	Promise.
CARRIE	I Promise.
CARRIE	Was secret sex the ultimate form of intimacy since it existed in a pure state exempt from the judgment of the world? Or is it just another way in which we deny our feelings and emotionally compartmentalize our lives?
CARRIE	Hello?
BIG	Do you miss me yet?
CARRIE	Who is this?
BIG	How have you been?
CARRIE	Great.
BIG	Fabulous.
CARRIE	"Fantastic, actually."
CARRIE	And you?
BIG	"Well, at the risk of sounding trite I haven't been able to stop thinking about you."
CARRIE	I adore trite.
BIG	Listen.
BIG	We should have a real first date.
BIG	You know? The traditional American kind.
BIG	Dinner and a movie.
BIG	"Of course, knowing us, we'll skip the movie."
CARRIE	Just as long as we don't skip dinner.
CARRIE	"What a relief! I had just escaped the ""sex on the first date"" curse."
CARRIE	"That weekend, I was out with a man whose name I wanted to shout from the rooftops."
BIG	Let me get this straight.
BIG	Your picture is going to be on a bus? That's right.
BIG	A crosstown bus or a downtown bus?
CARRIE	The M2.Goes right down Fifth.
BIG	That's a good line.
CARRIE	I'm getting together a group of my friends tomorrow afternoon to watch it go by.
CARRIE	I thought maybe if you weren't doing anything-
FREIND	How are you? Good to see you.
FREIND	You remember Phyllis.
BIG	Of course.
BIG	Phyllis.
BIG	How are you? Everything good?
FRI	Yeah.
BIG	Everything's dandy.
FREIND	That's what I hear.
FREIND	good to see you.
BIG	good to see You again.
FREIND	good seeing you.
BIG	Bye.
BIG	Bye-Bye.
BIG	Cheers.
CARRIE	who was that? Just some guy I skied with in Aspen.
CARRIE	I didn't understand.
CARRIE	Had I suddenly become the invisible woman? I tried not to let it bother me.
CARRIE	I also tried not to let it bother me that he took me back to Fung Wa scene of our postcoital dinner.
BIG	"Oh, I can't make your party tomorrow."
CARRIE	"Oh, no."
CARRIE	I wanted to introduce you to some of my friends.
BIG	"Well, I'll be home later if you miss me."
CARRIE	As I surveyed the room I realized it smelled like a cheap date you don't want anyone to meet.
CARRIE	I told Mr.
CARRIE	Big I was on a deadline and I had to get home.
CARRIE	Hello? Listen.
CARRIE	I have a question.
CARRIE	"Of all the restaurants in Manhattan, why did you take Libby to Fung Wa?."
IKE	"Well, it's pretty obscure"
IKE	There's not much of a chance of running into anybody I know.
CARRIE	You mean it's the kind of place men take women they don't want to be seen with in public? Yes.
IKE	It is perfect for that.
IKE	Sorry.
CARRIE	the evidence was mounting.
CARRIE	Was it possible that I had become Mr.
CARRIE	"Big's secret sex girl? The next morning, Miranda discovered a shocking sex secret of her own."
CARRIE	She had just spent a wonderful night with Ted who had to leave early in the morning to catch a flight to D.
CARRIE	C.
CARRIE	for a conference.
IRANDA	I can Go home.
TED	It's no big deal.
TED	no.
TED	Stay.
TED	It's 6:00 A.
TED	M.
TED	I'll be back tonight.
TED	You want to do something?
IRANDA	I'd love to.
TED 	I'll call you at work.
IRANDA	Have a good flight.
CARRIE	Miranda waited for the dead bolt to drop and then used the opportunity to ransack Ted's apartment and look for pictures of old girlfriends.
CARRIE	She was not at all prepared for what she found.
PORN STAR	Yeah.
PORN STAR	"Do you feel your cock where it wants to be every night? Every single night when you come home and everything's done in the house, and I've been doing it all day- I don't know what to do."
IRANDA	I can't admit to having found this but now I don't know if I want to see him again.
CARRIE	How can you judge him till you spank him? I'm only kidding.
CARRIE	But obviously this is what he's into.
CARRIE	Maybe it's just his fantasy life.
CARRIE	"Later that day, the cream of New York gathered to toast the maiden voyage of my bus."
SAMANTHA	Where's Mr.
CARRIE	Big? He couldn't make it.
SAMANTHA	"What do you mean, he couldn't make it? I don't know."
CARRIE	It was a work thing.
SAMANTHA	But this is your bus party.
CHARLOTTE	"I told you you shouldn't have- Well, never mind."
CARRIE	What? He's not here because I slept with him on the first date? Yes.
CHARLOTTE	When you sleep with a man on the first date the relationship will never be anything more than just sex.
SAMANTHA	Cheers.
CARRIE	I didn't want to admit she was right.
CARRIE	Here it comes! I just wanted to see my bus and get the hell out of there.
CARRIE	"Oh, shit."
IKE	Carrie! Did I miss it? Not yet.
CARRIE	No.
CARRIE	I thought you were going to bring Libby.
IKE	Yeah.
IKE	I finally ask her to join me in public; she turns me down.
CARRIE	Why?
IKE	She told me she met somebody else who doesn't have my problems with intimacy.
CARRIE	I'm sorry.
SAMANTHA	Quiet.
SAMANTHA	Here you come.
SAMANTHA	"Don't worry, sweetie."
SAMANTHA	Don't worry.
SAMANTHA	Nobody in New York notices a bus until it's about to him them.
CHARLOTTE	That's right.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, Miranda spent another wonderful evening with Ted and began to reevaluate her options."
IRANDA	That was one of the most amazing meals I have ever had.
IRANDA	Thank you.
TED	My pleasure.
TED	"You know, I missed you today."
IRANDA	You did?
TED	I guess I've just been waiting all this time for a good kick in the head.
IRANDA	And here I thought that all you really wanted was a good spanking.
TED	Excuse me?
IRANDA 	You heard me.
CARRIE	Ted didn't take Miranda home that night.
CARRIE	He never took her calls or returned her messages.
CARRIE	and she never saw him at the gym again.
CARRIE	"Very late that night, fueled by a massive quantity of champagne I decided to say good-bye to Mr."
CARRIE	Big.
CARRIE	I just came here to tell you that if you're embarrassed or ashamed to be involved with me in any way that we can no longer see each other.
CARRIE	"The truth is, I blame myself."
CARRIE	I wore the naked dress on our first date.
CARRIE	I slept with him too f ast and now I'm on a Fifth Avenue bus with a penis on my head.
BIG	What are You talking about? Y
CARRIE	ou won't introduce me to your friends.
CARRIE	You bring me back to that restaurant where men take women they don't want to be seen with.
CARRIE	You won't come out and meet my friends.
CARRIE	You have me in a niche.
CARRIE	Certain events.
CARRIE	Certain restaurants.
CARRIE	Certain people.
CARRIE	Like I'm only a particular fragment of the kind of person you think you should be dating.
BIG	But I've only gotten to know a particular fragment although I'm beginning to know more.
CARRIE	No.
CARRIE	This is not me.
CARRIE	This is me reacting to your perception of me.
BIG	Well I think Fung Wa's is the best Chinese food in the city so that's why we went there.
BIG	"And the guy we met in the street, and I couldn't remember his name- which possibly means I have Alzheimer's- so that's what that was about."
BIG	"And this afternoon I had courtside tickets to the Knicks and that's all, folks."
CARRIE	"I should have been jumping f r joy, but I only felt a hard knot of fear."
CARRIE	So you and me- then maybe this is for real?
BIG	Could be.
CARRIE	The island of Manhattan is a cozy village populated by more than seven million fascinating individuals
CARRIE	"... who all behave like they own the sidewalk but lately it seemed as if the entire city had been magically reduced to only two people... us. Four-hour conversations flew by in a space of fifteen minutes and a few days apart felt like weeks, I realized that Einstein's law of relativity would have to be amended to include a special set of rules, those to explain the peculiar effects of infatuation."
CARRIE	Hello?
IRANDA	"Hi, I'm trying to get hold of a Miss Carrie Bradshaw; she used to be a friend of mine."
CARRIE	"Yeah, good morning."
IRANDA	"Wait, I think I recognize that voice."
CARRIE	"God, I can't believe it's been that long, I've been meaning to call you. I've just been..."
IRANDA	fucking your brains out?
CARRIE	"Well, yeah, that's the least of it. You know what, I don't think that I have been hit this hard since...nah you know what, I'm not going to compare it to anything else because everything else has always ended."
IRANDA	"So, will I actually get to see you sometime?"
CARRIE	"Yeah, absolutely, how about tonight?"
IRANDA	"Yeah, tonight'll work."
CARRIE	"Alright, so I'll call Charlotte and Samantha and see if they're free, â€˜cause...Big's got this dinner thing, so ya' know, we didn't have any plans anyway..."
IRANDA	"God, would you listen to yourself?"
CARRIE	"Yeah, I know, I've become one of those women we hate."
IRANDA	"Yes you have, I can't talk now, I'll call you later ok?"
CARRIE	"All right, bye."
CARRIE	"As I hung up, I realized I'd committed the cardinal sin. I'd forsaken my girlfriends for my new boyfriend."
CARRIE  	That night I faced the tribunal.
IRANDA	We really weren't that concerned.
SAMANTHA	Just completely hurt and offended.
CHARLOTTE	"Actually, you missed a lot."
CARRIE	"Miranda had worked on a big successful merger... Samantha was obsessed with the idea of a new apartment...And Charlotte, Charlotte was practically engaged. They met the day after I dropped off the edge of the earth... He's name was Michael Conway, he was from a good New York family and he absolutely adored Charlotte."
CHARLOTTE	"I think this might be it, I think this might be the one."
SAMANTHA	"We've met him, he's perfect."
IRANDA	Even his fucking dog is perfect.
CHARLOTTE	But... there's one thing.
CARRIE	"Last night after Michael took Charlotte to the Philharmonic, they went back to his place and began the classic dating ritual ...the blowjob tug of war."
ICHAEL	"Oh, come on."
CHARLOTTE	not tonight.
ICHAEL	When?
CHARLOTTE	"Uhm, sometime."
CHARLOTTE	The truth is... I hate doing it.
SAMANTHA	"Honey, you can't be serious."
IRANDA	Are telling us you never perform this act?
CARRIE	"She'll juggle, she'll spin plates, but she won't give head."
CHARLOTTE	I don't like putting it in my mouth. I have a very sensitive gag reflex and it makes me want to puke.
IRANDA	That's one way to say no.
CHARLOTTE	It's not like I haven't tried... practiced on a banana. I pretended it was a popsicle but ... I just don't like it.
IRANDA	"Personally, I'm loving it up to the point when the guy wants me to swallow."
CARRIE	"Well, that's just really a judgement call."
SAMANTHA	Some men just take it so personally if you don't.
IRANDA	Some guys don't give you a choice.
CARRIE	"Well, that's just bad behavior."
CHARLOTTE	Are you honestly telling me you like it?
CARRIE	"Well, it's not my favorite thing on the menu but, you know, I'll order it from time to time. And, with the right guy, it can be nice."
IRANDA	Oral sex is like god's gift to women; you can get off without worrying about getting pregnant.
SAMANTHA	"Plus, the sense of power is such a turn on. Maybe you're on your knees but you've got him by the balls."
CHARLOTTE	"Now, you see, that is the reason that I don't want to go down this road."
CARRIE	"Well, sweetheart if you're going to get all choked up about it...just don't do it."
IRANDA	"But if you don't go down on him, how can you expect him to go down on you?"
CHARLOTTE	I don't.
IRANDA	"Oh well forget it, I only give head to get head."
SAMANTHA	Me too.
CARRIE	"A few hours and a couple of bottles later, vows of friendship renewed, we were almost out the door when..."
SAMANTHA	Isn't that Big?
CARRIE	"Yeah, I'm going to go over and say hi."
IRANDA	Ditching us now would be in really bad form.
CARRIE	I'm not going to ditch you.
CARRIE	Surprise.
BIG	"Hey, Carrie, how are you?"
CARRIE	"Good, good I was just out here, with my posse having dinner and ...er...I saw you."
BIG	"Oh, uhm, Carrie this is Julia Woods."
BIG	"Julia, Carrie Bradshaw."
JULIA	Pleased to meet you.
CARRIE	Can I talk to you for a second?
BIG	Sure.
CARRIE	Excuse me.
CARRIE	Are you on a date?
BIG	Sort of.
CARRIE	I thought you said you had a business thing tonight.
BIG	I said a dinner thing.
CARRIE	"Well, she's stunning and I should know because frankly, she stunned me."
CARRIE	"Well, uhm, enjoy your dinner."
BIG	Are you ok?
CARRIE	"Oh, sure, sure. I was just...er...You know I didn't realize you were dating other women."
BIG	"Well, not a lot of them. Why don't we talk about this Saturday?"
CARRIE	"Sure, sure, sure. So uhm then, enjoy your dinner. Oh already said that...enjoy it twice."
SAMANTHA	Here we go.
CARRIE	"I can't believe it, he's seeing other women!"
SAMANTHA	Prick!
CARRIE	"True, we had never discussed exclusivity. But while for me the idea of seeing another man would be like trying to fit another outfit into an already over-stuffed suitcase, Big was happily dating another woman like it was the most natural thing in the world. Is it that men have an innate aversion to monogamy, or is it more than that? I wondered in a city like New York, with it's infinite possibilities, has monogamy become too much to expect?"
WATER BOY	"I've been involved in a monogamous relationship for over a year now. It's been wonderfully fulfilling. Of course, my definition of monogamy includes sex with prostitutes."
ID 30â€™S LADY	The problem with monogamy?... it's just so incredibly dull!
ID-30â€™S GUY	My lover and I have a kind of 90's monogamy. We have sex with other people but we don't exchange fluids or phone numbers.
ID 20â€™S LADY	Monogamy is fabulous it gives you a deep and profound connection to another human being and you don't have to shave your legs as much.
BUSINESSMAN	"Of course, I'm monogamous. Why, what have you heard?"
PAMELA	This is the c-line. This is the best in the building. Have you ever seen any place like this? Is this to die?
SAMANTHA	It's nice.
PAMELA	"Hold this, just a second. Excuse me, excuse me, was someone looking for a view?"
SAMANTHA	"Oh, Pamela it's beautiful but it's a little out of my price range."
PAMELA	"I know, I know, so sue me. I just love to show the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me. I will break my ass for you, sweetheart. I just want to ask you for one small favor in return."
SAMANTHA	My first-born?
PAMELA	"No, sweetheart. I don't even want my own kids! Promise me that you won't work with any other broker."
SAMANTHA	Of course.
CARRIE	"Samantha didn't believe in monogamy, especially when it came to Real Estate agents."
RICK	"This is a pre-war six. Notice the classic lines, very solidly built."
CARRIE	"Although Pamela had the hottest contacts in town, Rick did have a slight competitive edge. He gave Samantha the opportunity to combine her two greatest loves... Sex and Real Estate."
CARRIE	"That afternoon I dragged my poor, tortured soul out to lunch with Stanford Blach and attempted to stun it senseless with cosmopolitans."
STANFORD	Monogamy is on the way out again. It had a brief comeback in the 90's but as the millennium approaches everyone's leaving their options open.
CARRIE	"Come on, you wouldn't commit to a nice guy given the option?"
STANFORD	I can't even commit to a long distance Carrier.
CARRIE	You know what you are? You're a whore.
STANFORD	I wish that were true.
JARED	"Hey, Stanford."
STANFORD	"Jared, how are you?"
JARED	My book just got a kick-ass review at Entertainment Weekly.
STANFORD	How marvellous!
STANFORD	"Oh, Jared, have you met Carrie Bradshaw?"
JARED	"No, but I've read your column. Nice shit."
CARRIE	Thanks.
JARED	You should write about me sometime. My life's so fucked up right now.
STANFORD	"Oh Carrie, Jared is the writer of the book Â¨Avenue BÂ¨. And New York magazine just named him one of the 30 coolest people under 30 in the city."
CARRIE	"Wow, what an honor."
JARED	"You know, if they were doing the 30 sexiest women under thirty, I'm sure you'd go right to the top of the list."
CARRIE	"You're quite the storyteller, aren't you?"
JARED	That's no lie.
JARED	"Listen, the magazine's having a party tomorrow night at the Â¨BrunoÂ¨ I'll be sure to put your names at the door so, you'll be there?"
CARRIE	I'll do my best.
JARED	Groovy. Ciao.
CARRIE	"What was happening to me? I used to get a secret rush from men who hit on me during their fifteen minutes of fame, in this case it nearly felt exhausting."
CARRIE	Hello.
BIG	Hello. Hello
CARRIE	"Oh, hi."
BIG	I was just calling to confirm tomorrow night. Are we still on?
CARRIE	"Yeah, of course we are. Why wouldn't we be?"
CARRIE	I was striving for not coming over but I was worried I had just bordered on shrill.
BIG	I'll pick you up at eight.
CARRIE	"uhm, yeah, it's fine."
BIG	I miss you baby.
CARRIE	"Yeah, me too."
CARRIE	"There were so many questions I wanted him to answer but would not ask. Not tonight at least, no, tonight I would ask Miranda."
CARRIE	"He said, I miss you baby. Do you think that was meant to be some kind of coated Â¨mea culpaÂ¨?"
IRANDA	"You mean like, what he really meant was I've been a complete idiot please forgive me for having dinner with that other woman."
CARRIE	"Yeah, exactly."
IRANDA	Could be.
CARRIE	"Oh no, â€˜cause that would mean that everything he ever said that I interpreted as sincere, was said to interpretation. In that case what I perceive as his feelings for me may only really be reflected rejections of my feelings for him."
IRANDA	What?
CARRIE	"Oh god, I'm freaking. I gotta stop."
SKIPPER	"Hey, Carrie."
SKIPPER	"Hey guys, great to see you. What are you up to?"
CARRIE	"Just, hanging."
SKIPPER	"Oh hey, Allison this is Miranda and Carrie. Miranda, Carrie this is Allison."
CARRIE	Hello.
ALLISON	"Hi, it's nice to meet you, I've heard so much about you. You know, we're all such great big fans of your column over at Vogue."
IRANDA	You work at Vogue?
ALLISON	"Yeah, designer relations. Skipper and I just had the most incredible meal. This darling French Bistro. That I am telling you I lived a year in Paris and never ate so well and cheap. Go quick before the times destroys it with the rain."
SKIPPER	"Anyway, it's great to see you guys."
ALLISON	"Yeah, great meeting you."
IRANDA	Who was that self-important bitch?
CARRIE	"I think that was Skipper's new girlfriend. Well, she seems alright."
IRANDA	I didn't think that was his type.
CARRIE	"Well, that's true Miranda you're his type but you broke up with him, remember?"
IRANDA	"Something looks different, has he been working out?"
ANSWERING MACHINE	"Hey, Skipper here...leave me a message."
IRANDA (ON ANSWERING MACHINE)	"Hi Skipper, it's Miranda I just want to say it was great running into you today. You look great, did you do something different to your hair?"
SKIPPER	"Hello, Miranda. I can't talk right now."
IRANDA	"That's ok. I just wanted to say, maybe, I thought we could have dinner some night."
SKIPPER	Seriously?
IRANDA	"Yeah, I miss you."
SKIPPER	I'll call you later.
ALLISON	Is everything ok?
SKIPPER	Allison I think you're great and Uhm...but I gotta be totally honest with you. The woman who I think I love just called and asked me back.
ALLISON	You're breaking up with me while you're still inside of me?
CARRIE	"As Skipper re-dedicated his singular affection for Miranda, Charlotte was receiving her own declaration of monogamy."
ICHAEL	What do you think about not seeing anyone else but each other?
CHARLOTTE	Really? That might be a good idea.
ICHAEL	I think it's the best idea I've ever had in my life.
CHARLOTTE	"Well, in that case....absolutely."
CARRIE	And while Charlotte embraced fidelity and Samantha flaunted her infidelity. I found myself caught somewhere in between.
CARRIE	"So, whose very part of the apartment."
BIG	"Max, he's an old friend of mine, now remember back in..."
ELISSA	Hey there stranger.
BIG	"Melissa, this is Carrie Bradshaw"
ELISSA	"Hi, love your column, never miss it."
ELISSA	I've been trying to call you. You still have my passport.
BIG	She's a friend I once travelled with.
CARRIE	Internationally I would imagine.
BIG	"Let's find Max...Hey, Max."
AX	I'm glad you could make it.
BIG	"Max, I want you meet someone very special."
AX	Julia!!
CARRIE	"Actually, it's Carrie."
AX	"Carrie? Well, welcome."
BIG	"Carrie writes a fantastic column, it's called sex and the city."
AX	"Well, if you're looking for material you're dating the right man."
BIG	"Oh, thank you Max."
CARRIE	Are we dating? I thought we were just sleeping together.
BIG	"Oh. I'm sure tonight, we won't be doing much of either."
BIG	"Carrie. Carrie, you've got to be kidding."
CARRIE	How many women are you dating?
BIG	In the Tri-State area?
CARRIE	"Well, let's see there's me, Julia, oh, and let's not forget international Melissa"
BIG	I'm not doing this Carrie. Can't we just enjoy the party?
CARRIE	I don't know.
BIG	"Come on, what do you want from me?"
CARRIE	"What do I want from you? Nothing, I don't want anything from you."
CARRIE	"I felt like a fool I had gone so far out on a limb with my feelings that I didn't realize I was standing out there alone. When life gets this confusing, sometimes there's only one thing to do... Attend a fabulous party."
CARRIE	Hey Stanford.
STANFORD	"Carrie, what a surprise. Where's uhm..."
CARRIE	Don't ask..
STANFORD	What happened?
CARRIE	He became predictable.
STANFORD	How predictable?
JARED	"Hey, you made it."
CARRIE	"Hey, Jared."
JARED	I'll get you a drink.
CARRIE	Cosmopolitan.
CARRIE	"In a room where everyone was gorgeous, cool and under thirty... monogamy suddenly began to seem like a quaint notion."
SKIPPER	That was like... so great. Don't you just want to lie like this forever?
IRANDA	"For a few minutes, anyway."
SKIPPER	I missed you. I want you to know that that other woman doesn't mean a thing to me.
IRANDA	"That's alright, I don't mind if you keep seeing her."
SKIPPER	"Oh, god no. I broke up with her the second that you called."
IRANDA	"Skipper, you didn't have to do that."
SKIPPER	"Of course I did, I was so happy to hear from you we were still doing it while I was talking to you and I didn't even realize it."
IRANDA	"You're kidding, right?"
SKIPPER	"No, I'm not crazy."
IRANDA	"Yeah, that's exactly what it is, crazy. Listen, Skipper, I'm not ready for a full-blown relationship thing."
SKIPPER	What?
IRANDA	"I mean...we could see each other and still see other people, right?"
SKIPPER	"No, no, we can't. At least I can't."
SKIPPER	Why did you call back anyway?
IRANDA	"I'm sorry, I thought..."
SKIPPER	"I'm not your private stud horse, you know, just Dial-A-Fuck."
IRANDA	"Come here, come back."
SKIPPER	"I'm tired of being jerked around, I hope you find what you're looking for."
CARRIE	"While Miranda misjudged the intensity of Skipper's feelings, Michael left Charlotte no doubt about his."
ICHAEL	"You're amazing. You've got everything I'm looking for and I never found before in one woman. Brains, taste, class. And you're very, very sexy."
CHARLOTTE	Thank you.
ICHAEL	What's the problem?
CHARLOTTE	I hate doing it.
ICHAEL	You hate giving blowjobs?
CHARLOTTE	It's not that big of a deal is it?
ICHAEL	Sort of. Can't you just ... do it for me?
CHARLOTTE	Would you really want me to do something that I didn't want to do?
ICHAEL	You'll get used to it.
CHARLOTTE	"No, I won't. I never have. Sorry."
ICHAEL	"Well, I plan on getting a lot of blow-jobs in the future and I'm hoping that you're around when I get them."
CHARLOTTE	What's that supposed to mean?
ICHAEL	It means I'll have to find them somewhere else.
CHARLOTTE	"You're telling me that you would give up a woman who really cares for you, who would share your hopes and your fears and your dreams, the future possible mother of your children, all for a blowjob?"
ICHAEL	"You're right. Will you at least, lick my balls?"
CHARLOTTE	"Good bye, Michael."
CARRIE	"Michael was upset but butterscotch seemed pleased, she was finally back in her monogamous relationship. Half past midnight in a city that never sleeps, neither did the Real Estate market."
SAMANTHA	It's beautiful
RICK	"Isn't it? It went off the market at mid-night and you're the first one to see it. Two bedrooms, pre-war, fireplace and a view. Everything you wanted."
SAMANTHA	"I love it, I really love it."
RICK	I knew you would.
SAMANTHA	Let's celebrate.
PAMELA	"Oh, my god. I can't believe that you were working with another broker."
SAMANTHA	I can't believe you weren't gonna show me this apartment.
CARRIE	2 am and I already have a new man in my life.
JARED	"You know the greatest thing about writing a successful book, besides the validation the acclaim? knowing that I'm pumping my ideas to the world."
CARRIE	I thought it was the fact that you could behave like an utter asshole and people would find you amusing.
JARED	"I'm like in love with you, you know that? I'm like fucking in love with you. Will you go out with me tonight?"
CARRIE	Give me a minute; I just have to make a call.
R.BIG	Hello.
CARRIE	I just had to let you know that I'm at this very cool party for very cool people under thirty and this very cool novelist wants to take me home.
R.BIG	What the hell happened to you?
CARRIE	"His name is Jared, he's really cute and really successful and he just put his arms around me. Here, say hello, Jared."
JARED	"Hello, Jared."
CARRIE	That was Jared.
BIG	"Carrie, just...get over here."
CARRIE	"No, you get over here."
BIG	I can't. I don't know where you are.
CARRIE	"I'm at the Lennard Park CafÃ©, meet me up front. Your name is not on the list."
CARRIE	Forty-five minutes later I realized I was alone in a park at 03
R.BIG	What are you doing back here? you said to meet out front.
CARRIE	This is the front.
R.BIG	"This isn't the front, this is the back, I've been waiting out front for thirty goddammn minutes."
CARRIE	"You see those doors? That's the front, you were waiting at the street entrance."
BIG	The street entrance is the front entrance.
CARRIE	Depending on where you're coming from.
BIG	"Ok, I'm here now, what's going on?"
CARRIE	"I've done the merry-go-round, I've been through the revolving door, I feel like I met somebody I can stand still with for a minute and ... Don't you want to stand still with me?"
BIG	You drag me out to a park at 03
CARRIE	Yes.
CARRIE	In a city of infinite options sometimes there's no better feeling than knowing you already have one.
CARRIE	Once upon a time in a magical land called Manhattan a young woman fell in love.
CARRIE	Charlotte and Jack locked eyes at a black-tie benefit for Epstein-Barr.
CARRIE	She chased him through every disease in New York.
CARRIE	They've been officially dating since retinitis pigmentosis.
CARRIE	Jack was perfect for her.
CARRIE	"Architect, philanthropist and the sex was amazing."
CARRIE	"Late one night, Jack popped the inevitable question."
JACK	So what are your fantasies?
CHARLOTTE	"God, I'd love to own my own gallery and maybe a little cottage in Maine."
JACK	"Actually, I meant more like screwing in an airplane bathroom kind of fantasies."
CARRIE	The closest Charlotte had ever come to getting screwed on a plane was the time she lost all her luggage on a flight to Palm Beach.
CHARLOTTE	Well I've always wanted to do it in my parents' bed.
JACK	Wild. I like it.
CHARLOTTE	What about you?
JACK	"You, me and another woman."
CHARLOTTE	Come on! I'm serious.
JACK	"Charlotte, you have no idea how sexy you are, do you? The idea of you touching another woman God, it makes me hard just thinking about it."
CHARLOTTE	Wow.
CHARLOTTE	Jack wants us to do a threesome.
IRANDA	Of course he does. Every guy does.
SAMANTHA	Threesomes are huge right now.
SAMANTHA	They're the blow job of the '90s.
CHARLOTTE	What was the blow job of the '80s?
SAMANTHA	Anal sex.
CARRIE	"Any sex, period."
IRANDA	Don't let him pressure you into it.
IRANDA	It's just this guy's cheap ploy to watch you be a lesbian for a night.
SAMANTHA	Don't knock it till you've tried it.
IRANDA	"I had a threesome once, I think."
IRANDA	In college.
IRANDA	I was drunk.
IRANDA	I woke up in someone else's bra.
SAMANTHA	The only way to do a threesome is to be the guest star.
CHARLOTTE	the guest star?
SAMANTHA	Yeah.
SAMANTHA	"The girl the couple gets to come in, screw and leave."
CARRIE	the pinch hitter.
SAMANTHA	Exactly.
SAMANTHA	Perfect.
SAMANTHA	Great sex without wondering what it will do to your relationship.
CHARLOTTE	But you don't have relationships.
SAMANTHA	Which is Why I have Great sex.
CARRIE	I've never done a threesome.
IRANDA	because You have relationships.
CHARLOTTE	I've never done a threesome.
SAMANTHA	Of course you haven't.
SAMANTHA	You in a threesome? You won't even wear a thong.
CHARLOTTE	Jack thinks I'm sexy.
IRANDA	He's buttering you up.
IRANDA	"You start thinking you're hot, then he brings up the threesome thing."
IRANDA	Boom! Suddenly you're kissing another woman while he beats off.
CHARLOTTE	Please!
SAMANTHA	"Just make sure the other woman isn't a friend. Use somebody random, somebody you meet in a bar or something."
IRANDA	That's romantic.
CHARLOTTE	no.
CHARLOTTE	"I think I'd feel safer with a friend, with someone I could trust."
CHARLOTTE	Like Carrie.
CARRIE	"Gee, I'm flattered."
CARRIE	"But I'd go with someone who has a little more experience, like Sam."
SAMANTHA	"Well, thanks."
SAMANTHA	But there is something sexy about a first-timer like Charlotte.
CHARLOTTE	Really?
SAMANTHA	Yeah.
IRANDA	Great.
IRANDA	"No, forget about me."
SAMANTHA	come on.
IRANDA	I'd do it with you guys.
IRANDA	It's like picking teams for dodgeball all over again.
CARRIE	Was Samantha right? Were threesomes the new sexual frontier? No question.
CARRIE	Guys were infatuated with threesomes.
CARRIE	"And when I started looking, they were everywhere."
CARRIE	"After all, our lives are built on threesomes."
CARRIE	"Fat, low-fat, nonfat."
CARRIE	"First, business, economy."
CARRIE	"Moe, Larry, Curly."
CARRIE	Maybe we were never meant to do it with only one other person.
CARRIE	Maybe threesomes were the relationship of the future.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, Samantha had been busy guest-starring in a show I like to call ""Sam Does the Married Guy."
KEN	""" I love that you're not my wife."
SAMANTHA	"I love that, too."
KEN	"I mean, that thing you do with your hips! Ruth won't even get on top."
CARRIE	"Ken was 37, a wine importer unhappily married to a woman who designed modular office furniture."
CARRIE	This affair was the most exciting thing that had happened to him since the '94 Montrachet.
CARRIE	"Five hours later, Charlotte's night was just beginning."
CARRIE	She and Jack had just had another fantastic date dancing for dyslexia.
JACK	"So, what do you think of her? Is she hot? You're right."
CHARLOTTE	Jack!
JACK	You're right. Maybe she's more your taste.
CHARLOTTE	Stop it.
WOMAN	have a light?
CHARLOTTE	"Sorry, I don't smoke."
WOMAN	That's a shame.
JACK	Did you see that? She was flirting with us.
CHARLOTTE	I think she was flirting with you.
JACK	"You are such a turn on, and you have no idea."
JACK	You're giving off this sexual energy all the time.
JACK	A vibe like you've got a fire inside of you.
JACK	She'd be crazy not to be in to you.
CARRIE	Who knows whether it was her vodka or her vibe but Charlotte suddenly did feel a little warm.
CHARLOTTE	I think she put her hand on my leg.
JACK	Should I ask her to join us?
CARRIE	That night she had an eye-opening experience.
CARRIE	Charlotte hadn't been that excited since she tried on her cheerleading uniform.
THERAPIST	"What do you think your dream meant? I'm in the sand box with Charlotte, Sam and Carrie and they won't play with me."
IRANDA	"I'm in the sand box with Charlotte, Sam and Carrie and they won't play with me."
IRANDA	Please.
IRANDA	It's obvious.
CARRIE	"Across town, Miranda was dealing with her own nightmare."
IRANDA	"I know it's juvenile, but it bothers me."
IRANDA	"I'm attractive, smart."
IRANDA	Right? Plenty of people should want me for a threesome.
THERAPIST	So you're saying you're attracted to your girlfriends.
IRANDA	"No! But if your friends won't go down on you, who will? That's some dream."
CARRIE	That's some dream.
CHARLOTTE	It was so real.
CHARLOTTE	I can't stop thinking about it.
CHARLOTTE	and I think I enjoyed it.
CARRIE	That's great.
CARRIE	Dreams are a good way to experiment.
CARRIE	It's like buying a dress and keeping the tags on.
CHARLOTTE	Do you think it means I should do it? Have a threesome? Jack says that I have a fire inside me.
CARRIE	Tell him they make a cream for that.
CHARLOTTE	I'm serious.
CARRIE	"It's your call, but don't do it just to make Jack happy."
CHARLOTTE	Maybe it would bring us closer.
CARRIE	Isn't it weird that you're thinking of sleeping with someone you don't know to get closer to Jack?
CHARLOTTE	How well do we ever know the people we sleep with?
CARRIE	"That was the thing about Charlotte. Just as you were about to write her off as a Park Avenue Pollyanna she'd say something so right on, you'd think she was the Dalai Lama."
CHARLOTTE	Do you think my hair too shiny today?
CARRIE	"And then, she'd say something else."
CARRIE	But the bigger question remained.
CARRIE	"If Charlotte was actually considering a threesome, who wasn't? The Village Voice had more ads looking for threesomes than it did for small, rat-infested studios running at $1000 a month."
CARRIE	But who actually answered these ads?
HONCHO	Wall Street honcho seeks two horny gal pals for an East Hampton fuck-fest at my summer home.
HONCHO	"No fatties, please."
WOMAN 2	"Sweet, suburban school teacher seeks two men to fulfill her wildest fantasies."
WOMAN 2	"You be black or hispanic, I'll be on time."
WOMAN 2	I need your dick now.
GUY 3	X-Files fanatic twosome seeks Scully look-alike for abduction fantasy.
WOMAN 3	"Me, gorgeous with big boobs."
WOMAN 3	"You, a couple with class."
WOMAN 3	Let's experience everything the city has to offer.
WOMAN 3	"I'm into museums, blow jobs, theater and golden showers."
CARRIE	I seem to be the only person in New York who still believed in the one-on-one relationship.
CARRIE	Big and I were actually doing sleep-overs.
CARRIE	Which one?
BIG	This one.
BIG	You better be careful.
BIG	I could get used to this.
CARRIE	Why is it that putting a tie around a man's neck is sometimes even sexier than taking it off?
BIG	What are you doing for lunch today? I could maybe swing an hour between meetings.
CARRIE	No.
CARRIE	"Sorry, I can't."
CARRIE	I have to interview someone.
BIG	about what?
CARRIE	Threesomes.
CARRIE	Ever done one?
BIG	Sure.
BIG	Who hasn't?
CARRIE	With who?
CARRIE	My ex-wife.
CARRIE	Suddenly my column was the last thing on my mind.
CARRIE	You were married?
BIG	Yeah. I thought I told you.
CARRIE	"No, you didn't."
IRANDA	An ex-wife.
IRANDA	That's a new twist.
CARRIE	And they had wild sex.
CARRIE	Threesomes.
CARRIE	We don't have wild sex.
CARRIE	"We used to, but now we have sweet sex."
CARRIE	Wild always beats out sweet.
IRANDA	But he's not with her anymore.
CARRIE	because they stopped having wild sex.
SAMANTHA	That's why Ken's fucking me.
SAMANTHA	His wife won't give him a blow job.
CARRIE	should That make me feel better?
IRANDA	He's never going to leave his wife for you. They never do.
SAMANTHA	Thank God.
SAMANTHA	Who needs the trouble? This is ideal.
SAMANTHA	"No muss, no fuss."
CARRIE	Sounds like you're selling toilet bowl cleaner.
IRANDA	Does this color turn you on?
CARRIE	You had to hand it to Miranda. She was determined.
CARRIE	It's a little orange.
SAMANTHA	There's only one thing left to do.
CARRIE	What? Leave him before he leaves me?
IRANDA	You kidding? Check out the ex.
CARRIE	Charlotte was right.
CARRIE	We don't really know the people we sleep with.
CARRIE	"After all, what did I really know about Mr."
CARRIE	"Big? Except he had an ex-wife named Barbara, who, I discovered, worked in publishing."
CARRIE	My plan was simple.
CARRIE	"I'd pitch her a steamy, bodice-ripping paperback which she'd probably reject but at least I'd get five minutes face-to-face with her."
RECEPTIONIST	Carrie? Come right in.
RECEPTIONIST	Barbara's ready for you.
BARABARA	Thanks.
BARABARA	Bye.
BARABARA	Carrie Bradshaw.
BARABARA	I am so excited.
BARABARA	Sit down.
BARABARA	I'm a huge fan of your work.
CARRIE	Good taste and beautiful.
CARRIE	Could it get worse? Oh.
CARRIE	Special Olympics chairwoman.
BARABARA	Sorry.
BARABARA	I haven't hung it yet.
BARABARA	"So, I'm dying to hear your pitch."
BARABARA	I never knew you were interested in writing children's books.
CARRIE	"Well, who doesn't love children's books? Five minutes of bodice-ripping material out the window."
CARRIE	So I did what any writer would do.
CARRIE	I pulled an idea out of my ass.
CARRIE	"Well, my story is about a little girl named Cathy, Little Cathy."
BARABARA	What makes Little Cathy special?
CARRIE	"Well, she's got these magic cigarettes."
BARABARA	she has magic cigarettes?
CARRIE	Yes.
CARRIE	Little Cathy and her magic cigarettes.
CARRIE	"Whenever she lights up, she can go anywhere in the whole wide world."
CARRIE	"Arabia, New Jersey."
CARRIE	"I mean, that stuff is gonna be all worked out, of course."
BARABARA	You want to write a children's book about smoking?
CARRIE	It's a children's book for adults.
BARABARA	You are outrageous.
BARABARA	I love it.
CARRIE	I thought you might.
BARABARA	I have been dying to do something with an edge.
BARABARA	This could be great.
CARRIE	It was the last straw.
CARRIE	"She was smart, beautiful, and she got me."
CARRIE	I'd have to kill her.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, Samantha was about to have her own encounter with the third kind."
SAMANTHA	"Oh, I'm sorry."
SAMANTHA	Ken!
KEN	Sam!
RUTH	You two know each other?
SAMANTHA	Sure.
KEN	Not really.
KEN	"Ruth, this is Sam."
KEN	Samantha.
KEN	She bought pinot noir from me.
KEN	"Sam, this is my wife Ruth."
RUTH	Hi.
KEN	"Okay, we should be going."
KEN	See you.
CARRIE	That afternoon was a first for Samantha.
CARRIE	She successfully screwed a guy in under two minutes.
CARRIE	"The more Miranda analyzed, the worse her nightmares got."
IRANDA	"So, the four of us get into a cab, only they won't let me sit in back with them."
IRANDA	"They make me ride in front with the driver, who's the original Chris from The Partridge Family."
THERAPIST	What I'm hearing is you're still very upset about being sexually rejected by your friends.
IRANDA	Let me ask you something.
IRANDA	Would you do a threesome with me?
THERAPIST	I think we need to talk about why you're asking me that.
CARRIE	I take that as a no.
CARRIE	That night I thought I could put the whole Barbara thing out of my mind.
CARRIE	"After all, Mr."
CARRIE	Big was with me now.
BARBARA	Nibbling his ear lobes? How sweet.
BARBARA	Let me show you how it's really done.
CARRIE	So I guess you couldn't avoid a threesome because even if you're the only person in the bed someone has always been there before you.
BIG	What just happened? Where'd you go?
CARRIE	I was preoccupied.
BIG	No kidding.
BIG	About what?
CARRIE	"Your ex-wife's breasts, your ex-wife's lips your ex-wife's long legs. My column."
BIG	"You know, I didn't tell you I was married because it was a long time ago."
CARRIE	What happened?
BIG	Alienation of affection followed by divorce. Let's not talk about the past. Please?
CARRIE	What Mr.
CARRIE	Big didn't realize was the past was sleeping right next to me.
CARRIE	"The next day, the flesh-and-blood Barbara asked me to lunch."
CARRIE	Hi.
BARBARA	Thanks for meeting me.
CARRIE	Thanks for inviting me.
BARBARA	Wow! You changed your hair.
CARRIE	Oh.
CARRIE	"Well, thanks."
BARBARA	"Listen, I have some not Great news."
CARRIE	I'm back with Mr.
CARRIE	Big?
BARBARA	The head guys didn't go for Little Cathy. But fuck 'em.
BARBARA	They wouldn't know a good book if it bit them in the ass.
CARRIE	"Yeah, fuck 'em."
BARBARA	I still love the project.
BARBARA	And at the risk of sounding like a groupie I'd really like it if we could become friends.
CARRIE	"Friends? Two hours and four chardonnays later, I was sleeping with the enemy."
CARRIE	"So, never been married?"
BARBARA	Once. long time ago.
CARRIE	Really? What happened?
BARBARA	He had a wandering eye. Wandered right over to my best friend. What about you? Are you seeing anyone?
CARRIE	No one special.
CARRIE	"For Samantha, the shit was about to hit the phone."
SAMANTHA	Hello.
KEN	It's over.
KEN	I told my wife.
SAMANTHA	who is this?
KEN	It's Ken.
SAMANTHA	Wait. You told Ruth about us?
KEN	I'm in love with you.
KEN	Now we can be together.
SAMANTHA	"No, no, no."
SAMANTHA	Hang on.
SAMANTHA	Hello.
RUTH	"This is Ruth Scheer, Ken's wife."
RUTH	I found your Number in his drawer.
SAMANTHA	Hang on.
SAMANTHA	Listen to me.
SAMANTHA	You love your wife.
KEN	no.
KEN	I'm in love with you.
SAMANTHA	"No, No, no."
CARRIE	"Sam's ""no muss, no fuss"" affair was starting to feel very mussy."
SAMANTHA	I'm back.
RUTH	I don't know who you are but Ken and I love each other very much.
SAMANTHA	Of course you do.
RUTH	We have an unshakable bond.
RUTH	"Whatever it takes, I'll keep this marriage together."
SAMANTHA	Good for you.
SAMANTHA	"Listen, this was a huge mistake."
SAMANTHA	It didn't mean anything.
SAMANTHA	It was just sex.
RUTH	"Exactly! And if being sexually adventuresome will keep this marriage together, then I am prepared to join you with him in bed."
SAMANTHA	"Oh, no."
SAMANTHA	"No, no, no."
CARRIE	Samantha was a guest star.
CARRIE	Series regular was not in her contract.
CARRIE	That night at the Attention Deficit Disorder Masked Ball Charlotte felt free to indulge her fantasy.
CARRIE	It's amazing what sequins on a stick can do to free up inhibitions.
JACK	Who here is your type?
CHARLOTTE	Do you like peacocks?
JACK	Do you?
CARRIE	Then Charlotte did the unthinkable.
CHARLOTTE	"Oh, my God."
CHARLOTTE	She winked at me.
JACK	Excellent.
CHARLOTTE	I need to get out of here.
JACK	"Hey, you okay?"
CHARLOTTE	"Yeah, I think so."
JACK	How'd it feel?
CHARLOTTE	Weird.
JACK	"Well, I enjoyed it."
CHARLOTTE	I do have another fantasy.
JACK	What's that?
CHARLOTTE	Doing it upstairs at a party.
WOMAN 4	Can I join you?
CARRIE	"She realized that this was her moment. If she was going to take the plunge, it was now or never."
CARRIE	"Unfortunately, it was Jack who plunged first."
CARRIE	Apparently someone else's fire was a little stronger than Charlotte's.
CARRIE	She was not the guest star in this fantasy.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, at a bar downtown."
AN	Miranda?
IRANDA	Hi.
WOMAN 5	What a relief.
WOMAN 5	"Most of the women who answered our ad, they were kind of"
AN	Butt ugly.
WOMAN 5	Nothing like you.
IRANDA	Thanks.
AN	We've never done anything like this before.
WOMAN 5	It's a huge fantasy of Mark's.
WOMAN 5	I offered to do it for this 30th birthday.
IRANDA	Whatever happened to giving a nice pen?
AN	Are you doing anything tonight?
IRANDA	Let me just be clear here.
IRANDA	You want to do a threesome with me.
AN	"If you're busy, we understand."
IRANDA	I tell you what.
IRANDA	Let me just make a quick phone call. Okay?
CARRIE	"That night, Miranda finally got her validation."
CARRIE	Her shrink had suggested she come three times a week.
CARRIE	I didn't see Mr.
CARRIE	Big for eight days.
BIG	That was a Great meal.
CARRIE	"Yeah, It was."
BIG	"Actually, the food was terrible, and we were talking to each other like strangers."
BIG	What is wrong?
CARRIE	"Look, you tell me you have an ex-wife. You tell me you guys had a three-way."
CARRIE	"Yes, I asked."
CARRIE	"You drop this big bomb, and you don't give me any details."
BIG	You didn't tell me why you broke up.
CARRIE	I cheated on her.
CARRIE	I know.
CARRIE	She told me at lunch.
BIG	I know You know.
BIG	She told me she told you.
CARRIE	she told you?
BIG	she told me.
CARRIE	That's another thing.
CARRIE	You didn't tell me that you're still talking to her.
CARRIE	I still talk to all my ex-wives.
CARRIE	I'm so not finding that funny.
BIG	"Oh, come- Wait a minute."
BIG	The reason we had the threesome is because we were both looking for something or someone else.
BIG	Do you know anyone who's right for me?
CARRIE	Then it was just the two of us. And I realized the real appeal of the threesome: It was easy.
CARRIE	It's intimacy that's the bitch.
CARRIE	In a city of perfect people...
CARRIE	no one was more perfect than Brooke.
CARRIE	She was an interior designer who only dated A-list guys.
CARRIE	"For Brooke, every Saturday night was like the senior prom."
CARRIE	"So, when she got married..."
CARRIE	we were all dying to see which one had made the cut.
CARRIE	Was I the only one who remembered that Brooke once described this man...
CARRIE	as more boring than exposed brick?
CARRIE	"It was your average $100,000 wedding."
CARRIE	Investment bankers and the women who hate them...
CARRIE	"classmates from Steiner, Dalton and Brown..."
CARRIE	and us.
CARRIE	We looked like The Witches of Eastwick.
CARRIE	A wedding this size always has two singles tables.
CARRIE	We were at the other one.
CHARLOTTE	Hello.
BERNIE	"Hi. I'm Bernie Turtletaub, friend of the groom."
CARRIE	It was the Turtle. A Manhattan legend known for two things:
CARRIE	good investments and bad breath.
SAMANTHA	My feet are killing me.
CARRIE	"here, sit down."
SAMANTHA	I can't. This outfit only works if I am standing.
BERNIE	I think it works either way.
SAMANTHA	"You know, I think I'm at that table over there."
BERNIE	Your friend is gorgeous.
BERNIE	What do I have to do to get to know her better?
BERNIE	Do you think the pears in this tart are bosc or bartlett?
IRANDA	Who cares?
CARRIE	"Two hours later, we were bored."
CARRIE	Supplies were dwindling...
CARRIE	and one of our passengers had jumped ship.
CHARLOTTE	Are we gonna stick around and catch the bouquet?
IRANDA	That is so not going to happen.
BERNIE	Bosc! They've got to be bosc.
BROOKE	Can you believe I finally did it?
BROOKE	You're next. Bill's got some great single friends.
BROOKE	It's always better to marry someone who loves you more than you love them.
CARRIE	People are always telling me things I don't want to hear.
CARRIE	But this one crossed the line.
CARRIE	Did I wake you?
BIG	not at all.
CARRIE	Question.
BIG	Why do people get married if they're not in love?
BIG	I don't know.
BIG	"Companionship, guilt, political asylum?"
CARRIE	Why did You get married?
BIG	I was a fool in love.
CARRIE	That is so sweet.
BIG	and then I was a fool in divorce court.
CARRIE	-Now you're just a fool.
BIG	Exactly. Which is why I'm never getting married again.
CARRIE	"Suddenly, I had to concentrate on breathing."
CARRIE	are You in bed with someone?
BIG	no. are you?
CARRIE	Just three slices of wedding cake. You jealous?
BIG	That depends. What are your plans for the frosting?
CARRIE	good night.
BIG	good night.
CARRIE	I hung up the phone wondering...
CARRIE	could I date a man who would never get married?
IRANDA	Wow! A guy who doesn't want to get married! Film at 11:00!
SAMANTHA	Don't tell me you're surprised by this.
IRANDA	You know who wants to get married? Men who miss their mommies.
CARRIE	Maybe this wasn't my target audience.
CHARLOTTE	Am I the only one who thinks this is a major bummer?
CHARLOTTE	What if you spend five years with him and in the end you have nothing to show for it?
CARRIE	I wasn't thinking about marriage until he told me to think about it. Now it's all I think about.
SAMANTHA	Just be cool. You don't care.
SAMANTHA	Then he'll wonder why you don't...
SAMANTHA	"which will make him realize he does, and then it's a whole new ball game."
IRANDA	"So in your world, it's always sixth grade."
CHARLOTTE	I think that a relationship has to be based on honesty and communication if it has any chance of succeeding.
SAMANTHA	"Okay. If you were 25, that would be adorable..."
SAMANTHA	"but you're 32 now, so that's just stupid."
CARRIE	"I can't just ignore it, can l?"
GROUP	Yes. No!
IRANDA	"What's the big deal? ln 50 years, men are gonna be obsolete anyway."
IRANDA	"I mean. Already you can't talk to them, you don't need them to have kids with..."
IRANDA	you don't even need them to have sex with anymore...
IRANDA	as I've just very pleasantly discovered.
SAMANTHA	Uh-oh. Sounds like somebody just got their first vibrator.
IRANDA	Not first. Ultimate. And I think I'm in love.
CHARLOTTE	"Oh, please, stop! This is so sad."
CARRIE	I'm not gonna replace a man with some battery-operated device.
IRANDA	"You say that, but you haven't met ""The Rabbit."""
SAMANTHA	"If you're gonna get a vibrator, at least get one called ""The Horse."""
CHARLOTTE	A vibrator does not call you on your birthday. A vibrator doesn't send you flowers the next day...
CHARLOTTE	and you cannot take a vibrator home to meet your mother.
IRANDA	I know where my next orgasm is coming from. Who here can say as much?
CARRIE	"That night, Samantha went on a date with a flesh and blood man..."
CARRIE	while the three of us went in search of furrier companionship.
IRANDA	"Ladies, I'd like you to meet the Rabbit."
CARRIE	$92?
IRANDA	Please! Think about the money we spend on shoes.
CHARLOTTE	I have no intention of using that. I'm saving sex for someone I love.
IRANDA	Fantastic. Is there a man in the picture?
CHARLOTTE	"Look! Oh, it's so cute."
CHARLOTTE	"I thought it would be all scary and weird, but it isn't. It's pink!"
CHARLOTTE	For girls!
CHARLOTTE	Look. The little bunny has a little face like Peter Rabbit.
CARRIE	It's even got a remote. How lazy do you have to be?
CARRIE	"Later that night, back at the brier patch--"
CARRIE	Hello?
SAMANTHA	You are not going to believe the evening I've had.
SAMANTHA	are You listening to me?
CARRIE	Yeah.
CARRIE	"Jerry, who Samantha met at Brooke's wedding..."
CARRIE	"took her to Lava, New York's restaurant du jour."
JERRY	"From the moment I saw you at that wedding, I knew we'd have dinner together."
SAMANTHA	Aren't you cocky!
JERRY	"I'm the kind of guy, I see something..."
JERRY	"I like it, I go after it."
SAMANTHA	You sound like my kind of guy.
JERRY	Hold that thought. I'll be right back.
CARRIE	Ten minutes and a couple of cocktails later--
SAMANTHA	Where the hell is he?
CARRIE	He obviously had seen something else he liked and gone after it.
CARRIE	"Then, just when she thought her evening couldn't get any worse--"
BERNIE	"Samantha? Hey, Samantha!"
BERNIE	It's me.
BERNIE	Bernie Turtletaub from the wedding.
SAMANTHA	"Oh, right."
BERNIE	Are you here all by yourself?
SAMANTHA	"Well, sort of. I'm--"
BERNIE	"Sit down, join me!"
BERNIE	"God, you look great."
CARRIE	What Samantha needed now more than anything was a compliment from anyone.
BERNIE	I can't believe the synchronicity. I was just thinking about you!
BERNIE	"So, do you like this shirt?"
BERNIE	My ex-girlfriend picked it out for me.
SAMANTHA	"Honey, no offense, but your breath--"
BERNIE	I know.
BERNIE	"It's these Chinese herbs I'm taking. You know, for longer life."
SAMANTHA	"Well, with breath like that, you're gonna live a very long life alone."
BERNIE	I killed the last woman who talked to me like that.
CARRIE	Samantha was impressed. The Turtle had attempted a joke.
SAMANTHA	"Once we get the breath under control, I'm gonna take him shopping for a whole new wardrobe."
SAMANTHA	He's a cute little fixer-upper.
CARRIE	"Sweetheart, he's a man, not a brownstone."
SAMANTHA	"Honey, when I'm through with him, he'll be Gracie Mansion."
CARRIE	Samantha and the Turtle?
CARRIE	"But then again, I'm dating a man who will never get married..."
CARRIE	and Miranda is having a meaningful relationship with something that comes in a box from Japan.
CARRIE	"In a city of great expectations, is it time to settle for what you can get?"
CARRIE	I needed some answers.
CARRIE	"Later that week, I met Brooke."
CARRIE	"Just back from her honeymoon, she was all business: the business of marriage."
BROOKE	I'd like to return these.
BROOKE	Is there any way you can melt them down into one decent gift?
BROOKE	His friends.
CARRIE	"So, how is it being married?"
BROOKE	It's fabulous. I feel like an enormous weight has been lifted.
CARRIE	And that's a good thing.
BROOKE	What's that supposed to mean?
CARRIE	"It just means you're happy with Allen, right?"
BROOKE	"Yes, I'm happy."
CARRIE	Then I'm happy for you.
CARRIE	"Listen, I hope I didn't give you the wrong idea."
CARRIE	I think Allen's great.
CARRIE	"I mean, he's incredibly successful."
BROOKE	We think we're Carolyn Bessette. One day John
BROOKE	-John's out of the picture...
BROOKE	and we're happy just to have some guy who can throw around a frisbee.
BROOKE	"Look who's here. Hey, you two!"
BERNIE	What a small world!
CARRIE	I couldn't believe it.
CARRIE	It was the Turtle wearing Helmut Lange.
BROOKE	"Wow, he looks great!"
SAMANTHA	Doesn't he?
CARRIE	He twirls!
SAMANTHA	What do You think?
BROOKE	Fabulous.
SAMANTHA	He's like a whole new person.
BERNIE	Don't I have a 3:00?
SAMANTHA	That's right. I'm taking him to Bliss for a facial.
SAMANTHA	See you later. Bye.
BROOKE	"I have to run, too. I'll call you."
BROOKE	Smart girl.
BROOKE	She seems happy.
CARRIE	"Samantha left with the Turtle, Brooke left with a better gift..."
CARRIE	and I left wondering if everyone in Manhattan was settling.
CARRIE	My Zen teacher once told me that there was nothing like yoga to quiet a busy mind.
CARRIE	Just as I had reached the moment of no thought--
CHARLOTTE	I think I broke my vagina.
CARRIE	Sorry. am I pulling Too hard?
CHARLOTTE	"Metaphorically, I mean. With the Rabbit."
CHARLOTTE	Yes.
CARRIE	So you've been using it!
CHARLOTTE	"I'm scared if I keep using it, I won't be able to enjoy sex with a man again."
CARRIE	Why?
CHARLOTTE	Have you ever been with a man..You know...
CHARLOTTE	and he's like... he's doing everything and it feels good...
CHARLOTTE	but somehow you just can't manage to--
CARRIE	Come?
CHARLOTTE	Yeah.
CHARLOTTE	"Well, it's weird, 'cause with the Rabbit it's like every time, boom!"
CHARLOTTE	"And one time, I came for like five minutes."
CARRIE	It's not illegal.
CHARLOTTE	"Yeah, but no man ever did that. I'm scared. What am I gonna do?"
CARRIE	"Well, you know. You could still enjoy sex with a man and the Rabbit."
CHARLOTTE	"No, no. I'm done with it."
CHARLOTTE	That's it. I'm never going to touch that thing again.
CHARLOTTE	I got to cancel on the ballet tonight.
CARRIE	Why?
CHARLOTTE	I'm expecting a phone call...
CHARLOTTE	"Iong distance phone call, transatlantic."
CARRIE	Charlotte could never tell a decent lie.
CARRIE	I knew an addict when I saw one.
CARRIE	"I love Sleeping Beauty! The music, the sex, the costumes!"
CARRIE	It's so romantic!
STANFORD	"You only like it because she gets to sleep for 100 years, and she doesn't age."
CARRIE	I invited Stanford to the ballet. I knew he was available.
CARRIE	"Stanford, cute, huh?"
STANFORD	I've had it with the whole gay scene.
STANFORD	It's so competitive. You won't believe what happened to me last week.
CARRIE	"Evidently Stanford, tired of bars and blind dates..."
CARRIE	decided to place a personal ad.
CARRIE	"He scheduled a rendezvous with the only respondent on a cold, Sunday afternoon."
CARRIE	"Twenty minutes and three false alarms later, he was ready to call it quits."
AN	Stanford?
STANFORD	Yes.
AN	Sorry. This is not gonna happen.
STANFORD	It's so brutal out there.
STANFORD	Even guys like me don't want guys like me.
STANFORD	I just don't have that gay look.
CARRIE	I don't know. You look pretty gay to me.
CARRIE	"Come on, maybe it's just a phase."
STANFORD	Puberty is a phase. Fifteen years of rejection is a lifestyle.
CARRIE	Sometimes I think I should just marry a woman and get all the money.
CARRIE	"What is There, a cash prize?"
STANFORD	Yeah
STANFORD	My grandmother gives everyone in the family their inheritance when they get married.
CARRIE	She doesn't know you're gay?
STANFORD	She doesn't believe in gay.
CARRIE	Really? That's funny. Big doesn't believe in marriage.
CARRIE	"Maybe you should propose to me, and we'll all live happily ever after."
STANFORD	You really do want It all.
CARRIE	-I don't know. Maybe nobody gets it all.
STANFORD	"Though, you do have a point."
STANFORD	We're best friends. We make each other laugh.
STANFORD	We both sleep with men.
STANFORD	This is not a bad idea at all.
CARRIE	"Actually, I was kidding."
STANFORD	I'm not! Think about it.
STANFORD	Who else would keep you in expensive shoes and encourage you to cheat?
CARRIE	Now you're talking!
CARRIE	Friday night at the ballet with a man who shared my passion for hot men in tights.
CARRIE	Saturday afternoon in bed with a man who shared my passion for passion.
CARRIE	Maybe there was such a thing as having it all.
BIG	What's that smile about?
CARRIE	"Oh, I got a marriage proposal last night."
BIG	Really?
BIG	From whom?
CARRIE	"A very handsome, witty young man about to come into his inheritance."
BIG	"Oh, I see. Anyone I know?"
CARRIE	Actually his name is Stanford. Stanford Blatch.
BIG	I thought he was gay.
CARRIE	He is.
BIG	That should make for an interesting column.
BIG	What are you gonna do about sex?
CARRIE	I have you.
BIG	I guess you've got it all figured out...
BIG	Mrs. Blatch.
CARRIE	"The more he mocked me, the more convinced I became that this idea was genius."
CARRIE	"That night, Miranda and I had plans to join Charlotte..."
CARRIE	for a gallery opening in Chelsea when--
CARRIE	Hello?
CHARLOTTE	"Carrie, it's Charlotte."
CHARLOTTE	"I'm really sorry, but I'm going to have to cancel."
CHARLOTTE	I'm totally wiped out.
CARRIE	Wiped out!
CARRIE	"That was Charlotte speak for ""I'm spending the night with my vibrator."""
CHARLOTTE	"But you guys have fun, though."
CARRIE	There was only one thing to do.
CARRIE	A rabbit intervention.
CARRIE	"Come on, let's go!"
CARRIE	"Okay, where is it?"
CHARLOTTE	What are You talking about?
IRANDA	The Rabbit. Give us the Rabbit.
CARRIE	"Hey, it's a vibrator. It's not like it's crack."
CARRIE	"Charlotte, you hid the Rabbit behind a stuffed rabbit? That is so you."
CHARLOTTE	You have a lot of nerve coming in here. You're the one who made me get it.
IRANDA	I thought you could handle it.
CHARLOTTE	It's no big deal. I'd just rather stay home with the Rabbit than go out with men.
CHARLOTTE	All right. You're right. I'll go get dressed.
CARRIE	"With a little help from her friends, Charlotte decided"
CARRIE	that she wasn't going to settle for herself.
CARRIE	While Samantha was doing everything in her power to remake the Turtle
CARRIE	into a man she could fall in love with.
SAMANTHA	How's your dinner?
BERNIE	It's questionable.
BERNIE	I can't figure out whether the mushrooms are shitake or chantrelle.
BERNIE	They're definitely not porcini.
BERNIE	Maybe they're wood ear.
SAMANTHA	Maybe it doesn't matter.
BERNIE	My God! They're trompettes!
CARRIE	"It was then that Samantha realized that even with all her effort,"
CARRIE	he was still just the Turtle in black.
SAMANTHA	"You know, I'm not feeling very well."
SAMANTHA	I think I'm going to have to send myself home.
SAMANTHA	I'll call you.
BERNIE	Excuse me. Do you like this shirt?
BERNIE	My ex-girlfriend picked it out.
CARRIE	After 12 phone calls and three e-mails...
CARRIE	Stanford badgered me into at least meeting his grandmother.
CARRIE	I love that suit you're wearing.
GRANDMOTHER	Designed by Coco Chanel herself.
CARRIE	Seriously?
STANFORD	Grandmother's been wearing that same suit for 40 years.
GRANDMOTHER	And it still fits.
GRANDMOTHER	It never goes out Of style.
CARRIE	Never.
GRANDMOTHER	"I have it in blue, black, pink."
STANFORD	And eggshell!
GRANDMOTHER	Exactly.
GRANDMOTHER	Stanford tells me you're a writer.
CARRIE	"Yes, I have a column in The Star."
GRANDMOTHER	"I was a career woman many, many years ago."
GRANDMOTHER	But I gave it up to have children.
CARRIE	"Oh, wow! ls this you?"
GRANDMOTHER	Not a bad-looking girl. Don't you think?
STANFORD	Doesn't she look exactly like Deborah Kerr in An Affair to Remember?
CARRIE	She does.
CARRIE	"Oh, my God! This has to be Stanford."
CARRIE	You're the same person.
STANFORD	That's enough.
CARRIE	Come on. This is fun. I had no idea you had such a big family.
GRANDMOTHER	"How about you, honey? Do you want a family?"
CARRIE	As I looked around at all the memorabilia and family photographs...
CARRIE	"the faces of brides and grooms, children and grandchildren..."
CARRIE	I realized--
CARRIE	"Yes, I do."
GRANDMOTHER	"Stanny, be a dear. Go in the kitchen and get me some matches."
STANFORD	Of course.
GRANDMOTHER	I love my Stanford. He's a very sweet boy.
GRANDMOTHER	"But you know, he is a fruit."
CARRIE	I realized then that the only inheritance Stanford was going to get from his grandmother...
CARRIE	was her collection of Chanel suits.
BIG	Salt. Yeah.
CARRIE	"That night at dinner, I knew I would have to break the news to Big."
BIG	What do you think?
CARRIE	I do want to get married someday.
CARRIE	Maybe not today.
CARRIE	But I don't want... I can't date somebody that won't. What's the point?
BIG	Definitely too much salt.
BIG	"I mean, it's all in the timing. You gotta brown the garlic..."
BIG	"before you put in the onions, know what I mean?"
BIG	I thought we were having fun.
CARRIE	"It's bitter, but it definitely has possibilities."
BIG	You have a little bit of sauce on the lip...
BIG	right there.
CARRIE	My Zen teacher also said the only way to true happiness...
CARRIE	is to live in the moment and not worry about the future.
CARRIE	"Of course, he died penniless and single."
CARRIE	Let's be honest.
CARRIE	Sometimes there is nothing harder in life than being happy for somebody else.
CARRIE	Like lottery winners or extremely successful people who are 27.
CARRIE	Then there's that hell on Earth...
CARRIE	that only your closest friends can inflict on you--
CARRIE	the baby shower.
IRANDA	You could not drag me to that thing if you put a grappling hook in my mouth.
SAMANTHA	"Frankly, I think it's sad, the way she's using a child to validate her existence."
CARRIE	Exactly. Why can't she just use sex and a nice cocktail like the rest of us?
CHARLOTTE	I'm happy for her... I am.
IRANDA	"If I see another crepe paper stork, I'm gonna rip its cardboard beak off."
CARRIE	"Can I ask you, would any baby shower bother you..."
CARRIE	or is this one worse because it's Laney's?
CARRIE	Laney Berlin. You can't really describe her.
CARRIE	You just had to know her.
CARRIE	Chances are eight years ago you probably did.
SAMANTHA	"So help me, she fucks on my couch, she buys it."
CARRIE	Isn't that how you got the couch from me?
AN	"Laney, show us your tits!"
LANEY	Give it a rest! You guys have seen enough of my tits.
CROWD	Tits! Tits! Tits!
CARRIE	Laney did A&R for a record label...
CARRIE	"or, as she used to call it, sex with an expense account."
CARRIE	"Every time she went on a scouting trip, she came back with some hot new group..."
CARRIE	and a gynecological condition no one had ever heard of.
IRANDA	"Those things make so many public appearances, they need a booking agent."
SAMANTHA	"Look at her, the poster girl for low self-esteem."
IRANDA	"I have low self-esteem, but I express it the healthy way--"
IRANDA	by eating a box of Double Stuff Oreos.
SAMANTHA	She's so sad.
SAMANTHA	Take it off!
CARRIE	Samantha and Laney had a long-standing rivalry.
CARRIE	"Both wild, both sexy..."
CARRIE	both incredibly insecure.
CARRIE	"Two years ago, Laney did the most shocking thing of all."
CARRIE	"She met a Wall Street investment banker, married him..."
CARRIE	and moved to Connecticut.
CARRIE	That wasn't supposed to happen.
CARRIE	She was supposed to have sex with Sid Vicious and move to heroin.
CHARLOTTE	"Come on, guys. It'll be fun. We've never even been to visit her in Connecticut."
IRANDA	Exactly. There's a reason for that.
CARRIE	Lyme disease?
IRANDA	That's another good one.
CHARLOTTE	"But, it's a baby shower."
IRANDA	"No, it's a cult."
CARRIE	a cult? What are You talking about?
IRANDA	Listen to me.
IRANDA	"They all think the same, dress the same..."
IRANDA	and sacrifice themselves to the same cause- babies.
CHARLOTTE	She's insane.
IRANDA	"Hey, I've lost two sisters to the motherhood. I know what I'm talking about."
CARRIE	I think we should go. It's the right thing to do.
SAMANTHA	Give me one good reason.
CARRIE	Okay. You're driving down the road. You see a sign.
CARRIE	"It says ""two-headed snake."" You pull over."
CARRIE	Wild Laney is having a baby shower. You pull over.
SAMANTHA	She's got a point. It's the right thing to do.
SAMANTHA	Just imagine how fat she must be.
CARRIE	"As I penciled in the date, I noticed something missing."
CARRIE	In between the Versace show and dinner at Moomba...
CARRIE	there it wasn't--
CARRIE	"my period, four days late."
CARRIE	"That Saturday, also known as ""Seven Days Late""..."
CARRIE	four city girls set off to visit the country mice.
CARRIE	Are we there yet?
IRANDA	"I've already had two of these, so we're gonna be stopping a lot."
CARRIE	"Hey, nice outfit. Is there gonna be some belly dancing at the shower?"
SAMANTHA	Right after the gifts.
CARRIE	"Oh, shit! I totally spaced. I forgot to buy her a present."
CARRIE	How tacky is it to give the mother-to-be a fistful of cash?
SAMANTHA	Don't worry about it. You can go in on mine.
CARRIE	You bought a pregnant woman a bottle of Scotch?
SAMANTHA	The invitation said BYOB.
IRANDA	"That meant ""bring your own baby."""
CARRIE	What did You get her?
IRANDA	Condoms.
CARRIE	"Seriously, What did You get her?"
IRANDA	Seriously. They're pastel.
CHARLOTTE	"Hey, guys! Wait, wait!"
CHARLOTTE	"Hey, guys, wait for me!"
IRANDA	"Oh, my God! Look at the size of that thing."
IRANDA	we Could drive That to Connecticut.
CARRIE	I'm putting my name on that card.
IRANDA	"All right. Go, go, go, go."
SAMANTHA	Does anybody know how to drive?
CARRIE	As I turned the midsize coupe onto Hollyhock Lane...
CARRIE	I was struck by how a place so filled with nature...
CARRIE	could look so unnatural.
CARRIE	"Oh, Toto, I don't think we're in Manhattan anymore."
CHARLOTTE	Her house is beautiful!
CHARLOTTE	"Oh, and look at her dog!"
CHARLOTTE	"Hey, boy! Come here, boy!"
CHARLOTTE	"Come here, boy!"
CHARLOTTE	Why didn't he come?
IRANDA	Invisible electric fencing.
IRANDA	It's the latest thing. My sister has it.
CARRIE	"Ready, girls?"
CARRIE	Let's go.
CARRIE	"Charlotte sweetie, don't forget our gift."
SAMANTHA	Look at you! You're huge!
LANEY	I know.
LANEY	Isn't it great? I can eat anything I want. Jealous?
LANEY	Come on in. Come in.
LANEY	"Brigid, Roxanne, these are my friends from the city."
BRIGID	We didn't think you'd make it.
CARRIE	We got lost. We took the wrong bridge.
LANEY	"Remember that feeling, like if you left Manhattan...even for a second,"
LANEY	you'd fall off the edge of the earth?
BRIGID	"Oh, God, don't remind me."
BRIGID	"Oh, my God! It's the Bellini baby basket!"
BRIGID	"Oh, look, everybody!"
BRIGID	It's the Bellini baby basket!
SAMANTHA	"Speaking of Bellinis, I'm gonna have a big drink."
SAMANTHA	Jealous?
LANEY	Is she still barhopping and bed-hopping?
LANEY	It's so sad when that's all you have.
LANEY	"Okay, this is Rebecca..."
LANEY	Susan... - Hello.
LANEY	Mindy.
LANEY	"Don't get up, sweet heart. She's doing this in vitro thing."
LANEY	She's not supposed to move at all.
LANEY	That's Betsy and her boy Harry.
LANEY	They're inseparable. They do everything together.
LANEY	We call them our old married couple.
LANEY	Except it's not that funny since Betsy and her husband are getting divorced.
VOICE IN DISTANCE	"Laney, we need you!"
IRANDA	So all I have to do to meet the ideal man is give birth to him.
WOMAN	I love my son. Andy is 11 months old.
WOMAN	"He is a god, and I tell him so every day."
CARRIE	"Thirty years from now, what do you think the chances are..."
CARRIE	that some woman's gonna be able to make Andy happy?
IRANDA	I'm gonna go with zero.
CHARLOTTE	"Oh, it's adorable!"
IRANDA	Look at that Charlotte.
CHARLOTTE	I wish they made this in my size.
IRANDA	"I told you, it's a cult. We can't separate."
IRANDA	"Once they isolate you from the herd, it's all over."
CARRIE	As I watched Laney tear open a terry cloth baby bib...
CARRIE	with the same enthusiasm she once reserved...
CARRIE	for tearing off rock stars' pants...
CARRIE	I couldn't help but wonder...
CARRIE	"""Was I next?"""
CARRIE	You know what? I have to pee.
IRANDA	"If you're not back in five minutes, I'm coming after you."
CARRIE	"The truth is, I needed to escape."
CARRIE	The party had turned into a preview...
CARRIE	a preview of a life I didn't know if I was ready for.
CARRIE	"Even seven months pregnant, Laney couldn't keep her clothes on."
CARRIE	"Clearly, a part of the old Laney had survived."
CARRIE	"But I wondered, what was still buried..."
CARRIE	deep inside the mommies downstairs?
OM	"Before I married my husband, I slept around with everybody."
OM	Now I have an lnternet lover.
OM	No one knows.
WOMAN 1	"When I was senior vice president, 212 people reported to me on a daily basis."
WOMAN 1	Now I just yell at the gardener...
WOMAN 1	who doesn't understand a single word.
WOMAN 2	I'm exactly the same. I love my life.
WOMAN 2	"But every now and then, I can't help but think about..."
WOMAN 2	Lisa.
WOMAN 3	Sometimes I climb up into the kids' tree house...
WOMAN 3	"with my Walkman, light up a joint..."
WOMAN 3	and listen to Peter Frampton.
CARRIE	There's a woman in there breast-feeding a child who can chew steak.
IRANDA	You know how I feel about that?
IRANDA	"If you can ask for it, you're probably too old to have it."
WOMAN	"Jeremy, no!"
IRANDA	I just realized...
IRANDA	maybe it's maturity or the wisdom that comes with age...
IRANDA	"but the witch in Hansel and Gretel, she's very misunderstood."
IRANDA	"I mean, the woman builds her dream house..."
IRANDA	and these brats come along and start eating it.
CHARLOTTE	I just have to tell you your home is beautiful.
LANEY	Thank you. I know it's a big change.
LANEY	"But at some point, you have to get serious and settle down."
LANEY	"I mean, life is not a Jacqueline Susann novel--"
LANEY	four friends looking for life and love in the big city.
CHARLOTTE	Stop it! You are not going to clean up at your own shower.
WOMAN	"Relax, 'cause once Todd or Shayla comes around, you'll never stop cleaning up."
CHARLOTTE	Shayla? Did you say Shayla?
WOMAN	"It's so unique, isn't it?"
CHARLOTTE	It's so my name!
LANEY	I thought your name was Charlotte.
CHARLOTTE	"No, it's not my name."
CHARLOTTE	"It's my name, my secret baby name..."
CHARLOTTE	that I made up when I was 11 years old for my daughter when I had her.
CHARLOTTE	I told you. Don't tell me you don't remember.
LANEY	"I'm sorry, I really don't."
CARRIE	A complete lie. She remembered. We all remembered.
CARRIE	Charlotte had made us all swear never to use it.
LANEY	Anyway my husband heard It somewhere else.
CHARLOTTE	Really? Where? Because I didn't tell him.
LANEY	I can't believe you're freaking out over a name.
WOMAN	"I mean, you're not even pregnant."
CHARLOTTE	That's not the point!
SAMANTHA	What's going on?
CHARLOTTE	she stole my baby name.
SAMANTHA	You bitch!
SAMANTHA	Let's go.
CARRIE	Beers and bar nuts at Flanagan's off Route Five...
CARRIE	were the perfect antidote to Laney's House of Humiliation.
CHARLOTTE	"If I hadn't waited this long to have a baby, that name would be mine."
CARRIE	"Oh, Charlotte, come on. You're still young. You have plenty of time to have children."
CHARLOTTE	"No, I don't."
CHARLOTTE	I don't want to be one of those 40-year-old moms.
CHARLOTTE	No offense.
SAMANTHA	I don't want to be one of them either.
SAMANTHA	There are no frozen eggs in my freezer.
CHARLOTTE	Was the bathroom clean?
IRANDA	What do you think?
IRANDA	This is why I hate baby showers. You always leave feeling depressed.
SAMANTHA	"Paddy, another round."
SAMANTHA	"Well, l, for one, love my life."
SAMANTHA	And I will not be made to feel inadequate by all this baby talk.
IRANDA	I spoke to a woman with a master's in finance.
IRANDA	All she wanted to talk about was her Diaper Genie.
CARRIE	"Oh, come on, guys. It doesn't have to be like that."
CARRIE	You don't have to lose yourself to have a kid.
CARRIE	"I know plenty of cool, hip mothers..."
CARRIE	who live in the city and still have great careers and stuff.
IRANDA	Who?
CARRIE	I'm late. I missed my period.
SAMANTHA	"Paddy, honey, where are those beers?"
IRANDA	How late?
CARRIE	"I don't know, just a few- Seven days."
SAMANTHA	"Oh, honey, gray area."
SAMANTHA	"True, you're in front of the firing squad..."
SAMANTHA	but you haven't been shot.
IRANDA	I was once ten days late.
CARRIE	Really? were You having sex?
IRANDA	No.
IRANDA	What are you going to do? You gonna tell Big?
CARRIE	I am not going to tell him until I know what l--
CARRIE	till I know how l- what--
CARRIE	"No, I am not going to tell him..."
CARRIE	until I know how to finish this sentence.
CHARLOTTE	What did I miss?
SAMANTHA	Nothing.
CARRIE	"That night, Charlotte got out her wish box..."
CARRIE	where she kept reminders of all the things she hoped for in life--
CARRIE	a gift for Shayla...
CARRIE	a town house in the city...
CARRIE	a beach house in East Hampton...
CARRIE	her dream man...
CARRIE	her backup dream man.
CARRIE	It's very strange when the life you never had flashes before your eyes.
CARRIE	Carrie Held Hostage: Day Eight.
CARRIE	Miranda and I went shopping.
CARRIE	I'm on total ovary overload. Which kind do I get?
IRANDA	"Here. This one's on sale, half off."
CARRIE	"Sweetie, I just spent $395 on a pair of open-toed Gucci's last week."
CARRIE	this is not the place to be frugal
IRANDA	. -All right.
CARRIE	What about this one?
IRANDA	"Oh, Firts response. I remember First Response."
IRANDA	I had a very reassuring moment once with First Response.
IRANDA	Here's hoping.
CARRIE	What if I am?
IRANDA	"If you am, you am."
CARRIE	I don't think I'd be very good at this.
CARRIE	"I mean, am I maternal?"
CARRIE	"When I was a little girl, I left my baby doll out in the rain for four days."
CARRIE	Her face peeled off. That can't be good.
IRANDA	But I mean if you-
CARRIE	I shaved my Barbie's head when I was mad at her.
IRANDA	"When I was little, I took a rubber band and put it around my dog Pepper's snout."
IRANDA	what?
CARRIE	god.
CARRIE	"Can you picture it, us with--"
IRANDA	Kids?
CARRIE	Babies.
IRANDA	I'll probably end up with five.
CARRIE	Five hours and two packs of gum later...
CARRIE	I decided I couldn't take the test...
CARRIE	"till I knew exactly how I felt about the results, either way."
CARRIE	Hello?
LANEY	It's Laney.
LANEY	I just wanted to tell you it was so great seeing you guys the other day.
LANEY	"I know I was a big bitch, but you gotta know my hormones are going wild."
CARRIE	"The truth is, Laney's hormones have been going wild since she was ten."
LANEY	Seeing you made me remember how much fun we used to have.
CARRIE	We did. It's amazing how much time has gone by.
LANEY	Tell me about it.
LANEY	But I miss us. I really do.
LANEY	we should get together more often. - Mm -hmm.
CARRIE	Mm -hmm.
LANEY	"But I mean, we should get together, not just say we're going to..."
LANEY	but really do it.
CARRIE	"Absolutely. Listen, I've gotta go. I'm running late."
LANEY	where are You off to?
CARRIE	Actually Samantha's having one of her parties.
LANEY	she is? - Yeah.
LANEY	"Oh, man! See, that's the kind of thing- I love Samantha's parties."
LANEY	Why didn't you tell me?
CARRIE	"Next time. I promise, All right?"
CARRIE	"Okay, bye."
CARRIE	Faced with her own inadequacies...
CARRIE	Samantha did something only Samantha could do.
CARRIE	She threw an l-don't-have-a-baby shower...
CARRIE	to let everyone know she was fabulous.
SAMANTHA	Great to see you!
SAMANTHA	Oh! I don't have a baby!
SAMANTHA	Everybody drink!
SAMANTHA	are You having fun?
CARRIE	"Yes, I am, But not as much fun as Miranda."
CARRIE	Still convinced that marriage plus baby equals death...
CARRIE	Miranda chose life...
CARRIE	"also known as Ed, Samantha's accountant."
SAMANTHA	"If she fucks on that couch, she buys it."
LANEY	"Hey, you guys, the entertainment has arrived!"
SAMANTHA	What are You doing here?
LANEY	What I do best- partying!
CARRIE	Maybe we better sit down.
LANEY	Fuck no! Where's the bar?
LANEY	Somebody get me a drink!
CARRIE	"I don't knw, Laney. You think that's a good idea?"
LANEY	Fuck yeah. I'm due any day. What's one little drink gonna matter?
LANEY	Maybe it'll help me go into labor.
SAMANTHA	"She gives birth on that couch, she buys it."
CHARLOTTE	What are you doing here? What is she doing here?
LANEY	I missed You guys. Us?
CHARLOTTE	Us?
CHARLOTTE	"The pathetic, live-for-the-moment New York single girls..."
CHARLOTTE	who think that life is a Jacqueline Susann novel?
LANEY	"Look, I'm sure you get asked this all the time, but what is your problem?"
CHARLOTTE	"My problem? Just that I had a dream and you killed it, in a nutshell."
LANEY	"Really? You're lucky, because at least you know what happened to your dream."
LANEY	I have absolutely no idea what happened to mine.
VOICE	"Hi, Laney!"
CARRIE	I spent the next hour keeping Charlotte away from Laney...
CARRIE	and Laney away from the vodka.
CARRIE	Look who came up for air.
IRANDA	He's a good kisser and he's gonna do my taxes for free.
JONATHAN	"Excuse me. I'm sorry. Hey, Carrie."
CARRIE	"Hey, Jonathan."
JONATHAN	"Listen, I've been talking to your friend Charlotte. She's great."
JONATHAN	is she seeing anybody?
CARRIE	Wide open.
IRANDA	Just don't mention the name Shayla.
JONATHAN	I'm sorry?
CARRIE	Nothing.
CARRIE	It's a private joke. Go forth and date.
CARRIE	His name was Jonathan Bix.
CARRIE	He was a trader at Bear Sterns...
CARRIE	and had just closed escrow on a house in the Hamptons.
CARRIE	Charlotte suddenly realized all was not lost.
CARRIE	As she sipped her beer...
CARRIE	she mentally Scotch-taped her dream house back together again.
LANEY	This party sucks.
CARRIE	"Laney, maybe we should think about getting you home, all right?"
LANEY	"No, I don't wanna go back there."
LANEY	"Hey, you fuckers! Who wants to see my tits?"
AN	I'll take a look.
CARRIE	"Laney, come on. Come back. Don't do this."
LANEY	Relax! It'll be fun!
LANEY	"All right, look. Now we're gonna have a party."
LANEY	Pregnant lady showin' her tits!
IRANDA	"Oh, my God."
SAMANTHA	This is at once so sad...
SAMANTHA	and the most fabulous validation I've ever gotten in my life.
LANEY	This is weird.
LANEY	I don't think I can do this.
AN	No biggie.
CARRIE	Despite her best efforts to run free...
CARRIE	it appeared that Laney Berlin's invisible electric fence...
CARRIE	stretched all the way to Manhattan.
LANEY	"No, I know I can do it. Just give me one more chance."
CARRIE	"Laney, it's not who you are anymore. It's all right."
LANEY	I didn't know that was gonna happen. Nobody told me that was gonna happen.
LANEY	"I mean, somebody should warn you."
CARRIE	It's all right.
LANEY	"One day you're gonna wake up, and you're not gonna recognize yourself."
CARRIE	Can you take her to Connecticut?
CARRIE	I spent the entire next day sitting on a park bench watching children play.
CARRIE	"If I had to, could I do this?"
CARRIE	Would I be any good?
CARRIE	Would I somehow manage to stay me?
CARRIE	"Hello. Oh, my!"
OM	"Oh, sorry."
CARRIE	That's okay. She's adorable.
OM	"Yeah, most of the time."
OM	"You wanna go home? Yeah, yeah."
CARRIE	Bye. - Bye -Bye.
CARRIE	On the way home...
CARRIE	I got my period.
CARRIE	New York City is all about sex.
CARRIE	People getting it. People trying to get it.
CARRIE	And people who can't get it.
CARRIE	No wonder the city never sleeps. It's too busy trying to get laid.
CARRIE	But if you ever actually do manage to get someone in bed...
CARRIE	the real fun begins.
BIG	That's the kind with nuts in it.
CARRIE	We love our nuts.
CARRIE	After sleeping together for many weeks...
CARRIE	Big and I had gotten comfortable enough to really sleep together.
CARRIE	It was nice. It was the way...
CARRIE	I'd always dreamed it could be.
BIG	good morning.
CARRIE	morning.
BIG	Was that you?
CARRIE	"Oh, my God."
BIG	I think it might be worse under there.
CARRIE	Shut up!
CARRIE	I hadn't dressed so quickly since the time...
CARRIE	I was caught in the boy's dorm sophomore year.
BIG	Wait. Don't you want some coffee?
CARRIE	"Oh, gosh."
CARRIE	I'm late for a thing.
CARRIE	"Oh, my God. I was mortified."
CARRIE	I didn't call him the rest of the day.
CARRIE	"I tried to lose myself in work, but every time I stopped to think..."
CARRIE	"Oh, god."
CARRIE	I'd relive my hell all over again.
CARRIE	"The next day, I realized how childish I was behaving."
CARRIE	I decided to stop avoiding the situation and take the grown-up approach--
CARRIE	complete and utter denial.
CARRIE	I saw the Met is opening a new Goya exhibit.
CARRIE	Do you want to go this Saturday?
BIG	Sure.
BIG	"Could you get me some more duck sauce, please?"
CARRIE	I most certainly can.
CARRIE	"Oh, and we have to stop and see the Renoirs. I love the Renoirs."
CARRIE	There's a moment in every relationship where romance gives way to reality.
BIG	You know- You know what?
BIG	I'm exhausted.
BIG	You mind if we just call it a night? Okay?
CARRIE	Sure.
BIG	Good night.
CARRIE	Night.
CARRIE	That was the first night we slept together and didn't make love.
CARRIE	"By the middle of the next week, it was three times in a row..."
CARRIE	and I was beginning to worry.
IRANDA	Three times? Try three months.
CARRIE	no.
IRANDA	Yes.
IRANDA	Now would be a good time to wipe that horrified look off your face.
CARRIE	"I'm sorry, sweetie."
CARRIE	I just- I didn't know. Where have I been?
IRANDA	You've been having sex.
IRANDA	I've been at Blockbuster renting videos. It's tragic.
IRANDA	I'm like two rentals away from a free pound a Gummy Bears.
CARRIE	Relax. You're just in a dry spell.
IRANDA	I can't believe you said that.
IRANDA	You're all freaked out about three times. I'm talking three months.
CARRIE	That's different. Not doing it when you're with someone means much more...
CARRIE	than not doing it when you're not with someone.
IRANDA	What are you worried about?
IRANDA	I thought you said everything felt really comfortable and great.
CARRIE	Maybe Too comfortable.
IRANDA	What do You mean?
CARRIE	I farted.
CARRIE	I farted in front of my boyfriend.
IRANDA	And?
CARRIE	And we're no longer having sex.
CARRIE	And he thinks of me as one of the boys.
CARRIE	And I'm gonna have to move to another city...
CARRIE	where the shame of this won't follow me.
IRANDA	You farted. You're human.
CARRIE	I don't want him to know that.
CARRIE	"I mean, he's this perfect guy."
CARRIE	He walks around his perfect apartment with his perfect suit.
CARRIE	"He's perfect, perfect, perfect, and I'm the girl who farts."
CARRIE	No wonder we're not having sex.
IRANDA	You're insane!
IRANDA	It's been three times. It's perfectly normal.
CARRIE	Says who? I mean...
CARRIE	say it's not the--
CARRIE	then what else is going on?
CARRIE	Is it normal to be in the same bed and not do it?
IRANDA	I guess it depends on what's normal for you.
CARRIE	"Oh, God. I hate that."
CARRIE	Who am I to know what's normal?
CARRIE	I haven't dated in a hundred years. I haven't a clue.
IRANDA	"Well, three months is not normal for me."
IRANDA	One month was interesting. Two months was numbing.
IRANDA	"Three months, I am going out of my mind."
CARRIE	There are 1.3 million single men in New York...
CARRIE	1.8 million single women.
CARRIE	And of these more than 3 million people...
CARRIE	about 12 think they're having enough sex.
CARRIE	How often is normal?
AN	I have to masturbate three times a day just to make it through.
AN	"Some people take coffee breaks, I take jerk-off breaks."
WOMAN	They say the average 33-year-old woman has sex 3.5 times a week.
WOMAN	I'd like to know who that woman is.
SECOND MAN	My wife and I haven't has sex since the baby was born.
SECOND MAN	The baby's applying to Yale next fall.
SECOND WOMAN	Once- One time a day...
SECOND WOMAN	but two time on very special day.
SAMANTHA	Normal is the halfway point between what you want and what you can get.
CARRIE	"Even in the plow position, I could count on Samantha..."
CARRIE	for amazing sexual clarity.
YOGA INSTRUCTOR	Very good. Let's move on to downward facing dog.
SAMANTHA	"With him, I could do it every hour on the hour."
CARRIE	Do you think it means something if Big and I are sleeping together...
CARRIE	but we're not sleeping together?
SAMANTHA	the truth?
CARRIE	when have I ever wanted that?
CARRIE	"Okay, tell me."
SAMANTHA	I think there's trouble. I mean...
SAMANTHA	sex is a barometer for what's going on in the relationship.
CARRIE	"I wasn't going to tell you this, but..."
CARRIE	I farted.
SAMANTHA	then move your mat away.
CARRIE	not now. I did It in front Of Big.
SAMANTHA	Huge mistake.
CARRIE	You think?
CARRIE	It wasn't a choice. I'm human. It happened.
SAMANTHA	"No, honey, you're a woman, and men don't like women to be human."
SAMANTHA	"We aren't supposed to fart, douche..."
SAMANTHA	use tampons or have hair in places we shouldn't.
SAMANTHA	"I mean, hell, a guy once broke up with me because I missed a bikini wax."
CARRIE	I knew it.
CARRIE	This is a watershed relationship moment I'm never gonna be able to erase.
SAMANTHA	Sure you will.
SAMANTHA	Just go over there and fuck his brains out and he'll forget all about it.
SAMANTHA	Men aren't that complicated. They're kind of like plants.
YOGA INSTRUCTOR	Concentrate. Quiet your insides.
CARRIE	now he tells me.
YOGA INSTRUCTOR	Roll over on your backs. Take goddess pose.
YOGA INSTRUCTOR	Let your breathing work with you.
YOGA INSTRUCTOR	In...
YOGA INSTRUCTOR	and out.
YOGA INSTRUCTOR	In.
YOGA INSTRUCTOR	Out.
SAMANTHA	Would you like to go for a coffee sometime?
CARRIE	45 minutes and three animal positions later...
CARRIE	Samantha and Siddhartha were sipping green tea...
CARRIE	at a nearby health food restaurant.
CARRIE	Tofu or not tofu.
SAMANTHA	I always feel so amazing after yoga.
SAMANTHA	"My body feels so open, so alive..."
SAMANTHA	so ready for anything.
YOGA INSTRUCTOR	Samantha.
SAMANTHA	Yes?
YOGA INSTRUCTOR	I'm celibate.
YOGA INSTRUCTOR	"I practice ""parmacharia,"" Tantric celibacy."
YOGA INSTRUCTOR	I gave up sex three years ago.
SAMANTHA	My God. Why?
SAMANTHA	"Or more importantly, why? Didn't you like it?"
YOGA INSTRUCTOR	"Oh, I loved it. I'd have sex mooring, noon and night."
YOGA INSTRUCTOR	"Sometimes three women a day, and I was always ready for more."
SAMANTHA	Now you're just being cruel.
YOGA INSTRUCTOR	no.
YOGA INSTRUCTOR	It was all ego.
YOGA INSTRUCTOR	And where I am now is so much better than sex.
SAMANTHA	"Oh, come on, honey. Nothing's better than sex."
YOGA INSTRUCTOR	Think about really good foreplay.
YOGA INSTRUCTOR	Your sexual energy's just starting to awaken.
YOGA INSTRUCTOR	Now imagine a three-year foreplay...
YOGA INSTRUCTOR	where all that sexual energy is coursing through your body...
YOGA INSTRUCTOR	but it never gets released.
YOGA INSTRUCTOR	It just recycles.
YOGA INSTRUCTOR	Builds. Rises.
YOGA INSTRUCTOR	Until your entire being is humming with that electric sexual energy.
SAMANTHA	My apartment's just around the corner.
YOGA INSTRUCTOR	The only thing hotter than sex is not having sex.
CARRIE	"Amazingly, talking dirty about not having sex..."
CARRIE	was the most sexually deviant act...
CARRIE	Samantha had participated in for months.
CARRIE	The next night when I met Charlotte for dinner...
CARRIE	I had reached my own transcendental state.
CARRIE	Pure Big obsession.
CARRIE	Ok. The first time he was tired.
CARRIE	"The next two times, l--"
CARRIE	"I don't know. I don't know. It's bad, isn't it?"
CHARLOTTE	"Carrie, relax. There's nothing wrong with your relationship."
CARRIE	That's not all. I-
CHARLOTTE	what?
CARRIE	I couldn't bring myself to tell her.
CARRIE	I was afraid she'd go spontaneously deaf.
CARRIE	I'm sorry. What were you saying?
CHARLOTTE	People put too much emphasis on the importance of sex.
CHARLOTTE	It's not the most important thing in a relationship.
CARRIE	Right.
CHARLOTTE	"take Kevin and l, for example."
CHARLOTTE	"We've been going out for weeks, and we still haven't done it."
CHARLOTTE	"I mean, we touch and cuddle..."
CHARLOTTE	"but he's sweet, and he respects my boundaries."
CHARLOTTE	"I like it. It makes it special. Oh, there he is."
CARRIE	Meeting a friend's new boyfriend for the first time is always a little tense.
CARRIE	What if you don't like him? What if he doesn't like you?
CHARLOTTE	"Kevin, this is my good friend Carrie."
KEVIN	"Hey, Carrie."
CARRIE	What if you've already slept with him?
CHARLOTTE	You two know each other.
CARRIE	"Well, kind of."
KEVIN	We used to go out.
CARRIE	"Well, kind of used to go out."
CHARLOTTE	You two used to go out? That's so funny.
CHARLOTTE	Isn't that funny?
KEVIN	That's my office.
KEVIN	I got to take this. I'Il be right back.
CHARLOTTE	"Okay, when?"
CARRIE	Three years ago?
CHARLOTTE	Three years. I can live with that.
CHARLOTTE	Serious?
CARRIE	no.
CHARLOTTE	Good. Why'd you break up?
CARRIE	We were in different places and l--
CHARLOTTE	"Carrie, we don't have time for diplomacy. Just tell me."
CARRIE	He's a sex maniac.
CARRIE	When Charlotte discovered that Kevin had tucked his libido away...
CARRIE	"for her comfort level, she was even more moved by his restraint."
CHARLOTTE	I want you to know how much I appreciate your patience.
CHARLOTTE	You've been so patient with me.
CHARLOTTE	Shows how much you really care.
CHARLOTTE	And all that waiting...
CHARLOTTE	is gonna make it all the more special for us now.
CHARLOTTE	There's only gonna be one stop. Thanks.
KEVIN	I don't think this is gonna work.
CHARLOTTE	Why? ls It me?
KEVIN	"No, you're great."
KEVIN	I'm just not that sexual a guy.
CHARLOTTE	It's me. I know it's me.
CHARLOTTE	"Look, Carrie told me that you were quite sexual."
CHARLOTTE	"In fact, I believe she used the word ""maniac."""
KEVIN	That was before.
CHARLOTTE	before what?
KEVIN	Prozac.
CHARLOTTE	Prozac.
KEVIN	Yeah. I used to be such a mess.
KEVIN	Mr. Mood Swing. It's a total lifesaver.
KEVIN	The only downside is it takes the air out of my tires.
KEVIN	"After a while, it's kind of like a taffy pull."
CHARLOTTE	It's okay. Don't worry about it.
KEVIN	I don't. I wish I could say I felt worse...
KEVIN	"but to tell you the truth, these days, nothing gets me down."
KEVIN	You want to watch a movie?
CARRIE	Terrified of going to Big's...
CARRIE	for what could become another platonic sleepover...
CARRIE	I paced my apartment and tried not to think about our lack of sex when--
CARRIE	"There they were, my new neighbors--"
CARRIE	Mr. and Mrs. Get-it-on.
CARRIE	A couple so obviously into each other there was only one thing to do--
CARRIE	watch.
CARRIE	Then something wonderful happened.
CARRIE	My desire overcame my fear.
CARRIE	"Hi, it's me."
CARRIE	Is it okay if I come over? Okey.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, across town at the corner of Nirvana and West Third..."
CARRIE	Siddhartha was helping Samantha along her newfound path.
YOGA INSTRUCTOR	"""Blocks are connection to our inner life..."
YOGA INSTRUCTOR	"and true identities."""
SAMANTHA	You're hard.
YOGA INSTRUCTOR	I know.
YOGA INSTRUCTOR	"""Our addictions and attachments..."
YOGA INSTRUCTOR	are a way to block our spiritual hunger...
YOGA INSTRUCTOR	"through unhealthy and dependent ways."""
SAMANTHA	You're still hard.
YOGA INSTRUCTOR	It'll go down.
SAMANTHA	So can l.
CARRIE	I showed up at his apartment feeling sexy and confident.
CARRIE	Wearing my secret-weapon skirt that really hugged my hips...
CARRIE	I was ready to go.
CARRIE	He didn't have a prayer.
CARRIE	Very nice. Come on in. I'm watching the fight.
BIG	Baby.
BIG	Come on. Let me watch this.
BIG	"Oh, man!"
BIG	"Jesus, Carrie! Come on!"
BIG	Would you knock it the fuck off? I'm trying to watch this fight.
CARRIE	Fine. I'll leave.
CARRIE	What is wrong with you? Why are you acting so nuts?
CARRIE	Maybe I'm not perfect. Maybe I don't fit into your perfect life...
CARRIE	with your perfect apartment and your perfect pay-per-view fight.
CARRIE	Maybe I should leave.
CARRIE	I stood there and waited for the obligatory...
CARRIE	he's-coming-to-stop-me ten seconds.
CARRIE	He didn't.
CARRIE	"By the time I got home, I was sure he'd left an apology on my voice mail."
CARRIE	You have no new messages in your mailbox.
CARRIE	I didn't sleep very well that night...
CARRIE	but I wasn't the only one.
CARRIE	After a night of spiritual reading with her hunky guru...
CARRIE	Samantha began to feel things she hadn't felt in a very long time--
CARRIE	frustrated and horny.
CARRIE	She decided it was time to put an end to her suffering.
CARRIE	But just as she reached the place Krishna called the gateway to life...
CARRIE	she turned back and decided not to enter.
CARRIE	"After all, she'd come this far."
CARRIE	She could continue not to come at all.
CARRIE	In an effort to get her mind off sex...
CARRIE	Miranda had rented a five-hour Danish documentary...
CARRIE	on the Nuremberg trial.
CARRIE	It actually worked until-
CONSTRUCTION WORKER	"Hey, gorgeous!"
CONSTRUCTION WORKER	Why don't you quick drop this?
CONSTRUCTION WORKER	"Hey, she's thinkin' about it."
CONSTRUCTION WORKER	"Where you goin' so fast? I got what you want, I got what you need."
CARRIE	Like every woman consumed with a relationship problem...
CARRIE	I needed a project to keep my mind from obsessing...
CARRIE	and my hands from dialing his number.
IRANDA	Three months and one week.
CARRIE	Miranda needed to keep her hands busy as well.
IRANDA	did he call?
CARRIE	Nope.
CARRIE	And it's been two days.
IRANDA	Nice color. Ecru?
CARRIE	Egg shell.
CARRIE	"Well, I think it's over."
CARRIE	I should never have farted.
IRANDA	"Jesus, Carrie! That's it. I've heard enough about the fart."
IRANDA	It's not the fucking fart.
CARRIE	I know it's not the fucking fart.
CARRIE	I just...I think I'm in love with him...
CARRIE	and I'm terrified that's he's gonna leave me because I'm not perfect.
IRANDA	All right.
IRANDA	Let's just put the roller down and go in the other room and talk.
CARRIE	Sex has stopped. He hasn't called.
CARRIE	What if he never calls and three weeks from now...
CARRIE	I pick up The New York Times and I read that he's married...
CARRIE	some perfect little woman who never passes gas under his $500 sheets.
IRANDA	When did you get so obsessed with being perfect?
CARRIE	I don't know. It's something about him. You should see me around him.
CARRIE	"I'm not like me. I'm like ""together Carrie."""
CARRIE	"I wear little outfits- ""sexy Carrie,"" and ""casual Carrie."""
CARRIE	Sometimes I catch myself actually posing. It's exhausting.
IRANDA	Then stop.
IRANDA	Why don't you show him more of this Carrie? She's great.
CARRIE	What if he doesn't like her? Miranda?
IRANDA	"Oh, my God!"
IRANDA	Look at them.
CARRIE	I had no idea they did an afternoon show.
CARRIE	"When a show is good, word gets around."
CARRIE	"There we were, the '90s version of matinee ladies."
CARRIE	Who said the theater was dead.
IRANDA	"Samantha, I cannot believe that you would give this up on purpose."
SAMANTHA	"Actually, I hardly Miss it."
IRANDA	how long has It been?
SAMANTHA	a hundred years.
CHARLOTTE	"It never goes down, does it?"
CHARLOTTE	"Look, it's still--"
SAMANTHA	Hard.
CHARLOTTE	Yeah.
SAMANTHA	"Gummy Bear, please."
SAMANTHA	Give me the fucking candy.
CARRIE	"Hey, snapping over Gummy Bears..."
CARRIE	might be a sign that celibacy's not for you.
SAMANTHA	All I can say is that my big payoff better be worth it.
IRANDA	"Samantha, I don't understand you."
IRANDA	There are people starving out there and you're fasting.
SAMANTHA	Stop complaining. At least you can take care of yourself.
IRANDA	I'm way beyond that point.
IRANDA	"Beside, I think I've given myself carpal tunnel."
CARRIE	"Sure, it's all fun until you get to know each other."
CARRIE	That move is what they're famous for.
CHARLOTTE	It's been an hour. How can that guy still be--
SAMANTHA	Hard.
CHARLOTTE	I have got to try this again with Kevin.
CHARLOTTE	"We really like each other. That's got to be stronger than a drug, right?"
IRANDA	I'm warning you.
IRANDA	"If I make it to four months, I'm humping one of you."
SAMANTHA	"Oh, my God."
IRANDA	I hate them.
CARRIE	"After the second show, each of us went on with our Saturdays."
CARRIE	Miranda went to get a movie and another pound of Gummy Bears.
CONSTRUCTION WORKER	"Hey, it's my sweetheart!"
CONSTRUCTION WORKER	"You're looking good, baby. Good enough to eat."
CONSTRUCTION WORKER	"Where are you goin', doll? I got what you want."
CONSTRUCTION WORKER	I got What You need.
IRANDA	You talking to me?
CONSTRUCTION WORKER	"We got a live one, boys."
IRANDA	You got what I want? You got what I need?
IRANDA	"Well, what I want is to get laid. What I need is to get laid."
CONSTRUCTION WORKER	"Take it easy, lady. I'm married."
IRANDA	"All talk and no action, huh? What a cafone!"
CONSTRUCTION WORKER	"Yeah, she's something else."
CARRIE	Samantha decided to channel her frustration at yoga.
YOGA INSTRUCTOR	Good.
YOGA INSTRUCTOR	Now release and breathe.
SAMANTHA	"Unless you're planning to move those hands down, get them off me."
YOGA INSTRUCTOR	Exhale and turn around into asana.
CARRIE	She had reached the end of her path and her patience.
SAMANTHA	Wanna a fuck?
AN	Yeah.
CARRIE	Samantha spent the rest of the afternoon having multiple yo-gasms.
CARRIE	"Later that night, Charlotte was determined to prove she was stronger..."
CARRIE	than selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors.
KEVIN	Isn't your arm getting tired?
CHARLOTTE	"No, I think it's starting to work."
KEVIN	"Charlotte. It's not, and I'm beginning to chafe."
KEVIN	You okay?
CHARLOTTE	Yeah.
CHARLOTTE	I've just never been in this situation before.
CHARLOTTE	Do you think you'll ever--
CHARLOTTE	never mind.
KEVIN	"What, think I'll ever go off it?"
CHARLOTTE	Yeah.
KEVIN	Nope.
CHARLOTTE	Not even for me?
KEVIN	Nope.
KEVIN	Come on. Wouldn't you rather be with a guy who's kind and giving...
KEVIN	and not that interested in sex...
KEVIN	"than an unstable, oversexed prick who only wants to get laid?"
CHARLOTTE	Nope.
CARRIE	Once Charlotte realized she couldn't get what she thought she didn't want...
CARRIE	she couldn't imagine going on without it.
CARRIE	Saturday night's dinner came and went with no call from Big.
CARRIE	My life was suddenly shit...
CARRIE	but my cabinets were looking fabulous.
CARRIE	who is it?
BIG	me.
BIG	Surprise.
CARRIE	Yeah.
BIG	What's all this?
CARRIE	I'm painting.
BIG	I can see that.
CARRIE	Why didn't you call?
BIG	Why didn't you call?
BIG	So this is where you live.
BIG	About time you invited me up.
CARRIE	I didn't invite you.
BIG	I know.
BIG	It's nice. Very nice.
CARRIE	"No, it's not. It's a mess."
CARRIE	The floors need to be stripped and the curtains are--
CARRIE	I want to change a lot of it.
BIG	I don't know.
BIG	I like it.
BIG	I like it the way it is.
BIG	What was that all about the other night?
CARRIE	That was me...
CARRIE	having a meltdown.
BIG	Nice paint.
BIG	Egg shell?
CARRIE	Yes.
BIG	Did you know there's a couple humping outside of your window?
CARRIE	"Really? Oh, I never noticed."
CARRIE	All I could think was why aren't we having sex?
CARRIE	Is this normal? What's wrong?
CARRIE	where are we going?
BIG	"Oh, hell."
BIG	We can do better than that.
CARRIE	And then he kissed me.
CARRIE	Odd! How normal can sometimes feel so uncomfortable.
CARRIE	My friend Miranda was dating Thomas John Anderson...
CARRIE	an up-and-coming New York playwright.
THOMAS JOHN ANDERSON	"Oh, God."
IRANDA	That was wonderful.
CARRIE	Things were going great except for one thing.
THOMAS JOHN ANDERSON	I'll be right back.
CARRIE	Immediately after sex...
CARRIE	he'd hop out of bed and shower.
THOMAS JOHN ANDERSON	be Right back.
CARRIE	"night after night, It was the same thing."
THOMAS JOHN ANDERSON	I'll be right-
IRANDA	Yeah.
CARRIE	She decided to confront Thomas John Anderson as soon as he dried off.
IRANDA	"So, what's with the showers?"
THOMAS JOHN ANDERSON	What do You mean?
IRANDA	You always get up and shower right after we're done.
IRANDA	I'm starting to feel like it's me.
THOMAS JOHN ANDERSON	"No, it's not you. It's just--"
IRANDA	what?
THOMAS JOHN ANDERSON	It's just a habit I have.
THOMAS JOHN ANDERSON	"Growing up, the nuns told us sex was a sin."
THOMAS JOHN ANDERSON	So I just got into the habit of taking a shower after l...
THOMAS JOHN ANDERSON	"you know, came."
IRANDA	"Oh, the nuns."
THOMAS JOHN ANDERSON	"Miranda suddenly realized she was dating ""Catholic Guy."""
CARRIE	So you think the water serves as a retro baptism kind of thing?
IRANDA	Beats me. If I'd known he was Catholic...
IRANDA	I never would've gone out with him in the first place.
IRANDA	they should make them wear a sign.
CARRIE	Single people in New York...
CARRIE	rarely ask about their dates' religious backgrounds...
CARRIE	for the same reason they don't ask the number of former sex partners:
CARRIE	Too scary.
IRANDA	"I mean, he's a rational..."
IRANDA	Iogical guy in every respect but this.
CARRIE	Clean. You forgot clean. He's a clean guy.
IRANDA	Leave it to me to find the only religious guy still left in Manhattan.
CARRIE	New York is a city filled with places to worship.
CARRIE	But it recently dawned on me...
CARRIE	the only time I ever heard anyone mention going into one...
CARRIE	was for a singles mixer.
CARRIE	Are relationships the religion of the '90s?
CARRIE	"Having been raised in the church of ""be nice to people..."
CARRIE	"and don't talk with your mouth full""..."
CARRIE	I decided to check out some more traditional religious types...
CARRIE	in their natural habitat.
CARRIE	"As I watched people leaving church, I was amazed at how they looked."
CARRIE	"Valentino, Escada, Oscar de la Renta."
CARRIE	What is it about God and fashion that go so well together?
CARRIE	"And suddenly, there he was wearing Armani on Sunday."
CARRIE	Big.
CARRIE	I admit it was kind of a shock.
CARRIE	"Up until that moment, I thought he only believed in the Yankees."
CARRIE	"Hello there, churchgoer."
BIG	What are You doing here?
CARRIE	Research.
CARRIE	I'm doing a column on closet Presbyterians. You know any?
BIG	"Actually, I'm an atheist, but don't tell the minister."
CARRIE	Who's the mystery woman?
BIG	My mother.
BIG	I take her to church every Sunday.
CARRIE	Really?
CARRIE	I'm so loving that. How come you never told me?
BIG	"Well, you write every Sunday, so--"
CARRIE	So every Sunday- church.
BIG	Right.
BIG	"You know, I've got 20 minutes before my racquetball game."
BIG	Why don't we have coffee?
CARRIE	I can't. I'm on deadline...
CARRIE	"and this cappuccino just kicked in, so--"
BIG	So?
CARRIE	God bless.
CARRIE	It was one of those awkward relationship moments...
CARRIE	where you feel like you know nothing about the person...
CARRIE	you thought you knew everything about.
IRANDA	He goes to church with his mother?
IRANDA	That can't be good.
CHARLOTTE	Don't listen to her.
CHARLOTTE	A man who cares about mother makes a wonderful husband.
CARRIE	I think it's sweet.
IRANDA	"sure, All religions are sweet..."
IRANDA	until you get to that shower-after-sex phase.
CHARLOTTE	Oh my god. is he Still doing that?
IRANDA	It's amazing he has any skin left.
CARRIE	Have you tried taking a shower with him?
IRANDA	I'm afraid he'll pull out garlic and a cross.
CHARLOTTE	"So, which church does his mother go to?"
CARRIE	Park Avenue Presbyterian.
CHARLOTTE	Good church. It's one of the best on the East Side.
CARRIE	"What, are you rating churches? ls there a Zagat guide for that?"
IRANDA	"Four stars, great bread, disappointing wine selection."
CARRIE	"The thing is, I'm dying to meet his mother."
CARRIE	Can you imagine?
CHARLOTTE	Getting on the good side of his mother is like closing the deal.
SAMANTHA	I'm sorry I'm late.
CARRIE	It's about time.
SAMANTHA	I just had a five-hour lunch with James.
CARRIE	Five-hour lunches. I remember those.
SAMANTHA	"Ladies, I have an announcement."
SAMANTHA	Please don't laugh.
IRANDA	what?
SAMANTHA	I'm in love.
IRANDA	what?
CARRIE	Samantha uttering those words to us...
CARRIE	was an event as unfathomable...
CARRIE	as Moses parting the Red Sea.
CARRIE	It all started a couple of weeks ago...
CARRIE	on a particularly blah Wednesday night.
CARRIE	Samantha decided to treat herself to a night of great music.
JAMES	I couldn't help but notice how you move to the music.
JAMES	It's beautiful.
SAMANTHA	"Well, I love jazz."
JAMES	That's pretty clear.
SAMANTHA	Are you a musician?
JAMES	Yeah.
JAMES	Trapped in the body of a lawyer.
SAMANTHA	"Well, we won't tell anyone."
JAMES	May I join you?
SAMANTHA	Sure.
CARRIE	After they closed the jazz joint they walked and talked for blocks.
JAMES	You have to at least try one of the glazed.
JAMES	It's a little bit of heaven.
SAMANTHA	Heavenly. And I never thought I'd get there.
JAMES	Why not? An angel like you?
CARRIE	And then Samantha did something rather shocking for a first date--
CARRIE	she didn't ask him home.
SAMANTHA	"Thanks, James."
SAMANTHA	I had a wonderful time.
JAMES	Can I see you again?
SAMANTHA	I'd love that.
CARRIE	"And with that one touch, Samantha..."
CARRIE	who was never a believer in relationships...
CARRIE	suddenly became a convert.
SAMANTHA	"I mean, I'd totally given up on the idea that you could actually talk to men."
CARRIE	Don't spread that around.
SAMANTHA	before James...
SAMANTHA	all my conversations consisted of two sentences--
SAMANTHA	"""give it to me"" and ""go home."""
SAMANTHA	And I owe it all to Charlotte.
CHARLOTTE	Me? What did I do?
SAMANTHA	All that bullshit you spout...
SAMANTHA	about not sleeping with men right away actually paid off.
SAMANTHA	"I mean...if I'd fucked James already, who knows where we'd be."
IRANDA	Wait. You haven't had sex yet?
SAMANTHA	Soon.
SAMANTHA	You know...
SAMANTHA	I think he's someone I could actually marry.
CHARLOTTE	"Samantha, that's great."
CARRIE	The idea that Samantha could possibly get married before she did...
CARRIE	shook Charlotte's beliefs to the core.
CARRIE	She took some drastic action.
CARRIE	She made an appointment to see Noanie Stine...
CARRIE	psychic to the stars and a cosmic connection...
CARRIE	who lived in a brownstone between Central Park West and Columbus.
CHARLOTTE	is this You and Madonna?
NOANIE	Yeah.
NOANIE	We go to the same Cabala class.
NOANIE	Now...
NOANIE	"pick three cards, face down with your left hand."
CARRIE	Charlotte had heard about Noanie through a sorority sister...
CARRIE	whose marriage she had very accurately predicted.
NOANIE	"Ok. Now, is there one question in particular?"
CHARLOTTE	"Well, no."
CHARLOTTE	Just--
CHARLOTTE	There is.
CHARLOTTE	When will I get married?
NOANIE	"""Ace of wands."" Prosperity."
NOANIE	"""Nine of cups."" Strength and independence."
NOANIE	"""The Hanged Man."" A new awakening."
NOANIE	"You're a strong, independent woman..."
NOANIE	"with great success in your future, but I do not see marriage."
CHARLOTTE	Excuse me?
NOANIE	I don't see it.
CHARLOTTE	what?
NOANIE	I don't see marriage.
CHARLOTTE	"Well, how can you just say that like that?"
CHARLOTTE	"I mean, what about my feelings?"
NOANIE	"Honey, I'm a psychic. I'm not a shrink."
CARRIE	"So, who is the fabulous mother in the hat..."
CARRIE	and when do I get to go to church with you two?
BIG	You want to go to church?
CARRIE	You say that like I'm the antichrist or something.
BIG	No. It's just I never thought of you as the church type.
CARRIE	"Oh, really? What type am l?"
BIG	The incredibly beautiful and intelligent type.
BIG	What religion are you?
CARRIE	I'm no one religion in particular. I'm open to all.
BIG	Kind of like a 7-Eleven?
CARRIE	come on.
CARRIE	I want to go to church with you and your mommy. How about this Sunday?
BIG	"Well, it's just a private little thing..."
BIG	"my mother and I do, just the two of us."
BIG	You want to go to the Caribbean next week?
CARRIE	Sure. I'll go pack my jet ski.
BIG	"No, I'm serious. We could both use a vacation."
BIG	"The sun, the sand, you and me. You waiting on me."
BIG	can You get away?
CARRIE	"Yeah, but I can't afford it."
BIG	I'll tell you what. I'll buy the tickets.
BIG	"When we get to St. Barts, you can buy me one big margarita."
IRANDA	Wait. I want to hold you.
THOMAS JOHN ANDERSON	I'll be right back.
IRANDA	Stay here a second.
IRANDA	Isn't this nice? Us together?
THOMAS JOHN ANDERSON	Yeah.
THOMAS JOHN ANDERSON	"Look. I'm just gonna go jump in the shower, and then, boom, I'm all yours."
IRANDA	There's nothing sinful about sex.
THOMAS JOHN ANDERSON	"Oh, really?"
THOMAS JOHN ANDERSON	"Well, thanks for clearing that up."
THOMAS JOHN ANDERSON	And what is that? The gospel according to Miranda?
THOMAS JOHN ANDERSON	And what are you gonna tell me next that God made the body...
THOMAS JOHN ANDERSON	and if God made the body and sex is an expression of that body...
THOMAS JOHN ANDERSON	how could anything made by that God-made body be considered sin?
IRANDA	"Well, yeah."
THOMAS JOHN ANDERSON	It's a miracle! I'm healed!
THOMAS JOHN ANDERSON	You're free to go work with the lepers now.
THOMAS JOHN ANDERSON	I guess this means I'm not going to hell.
THOMAS JOHN ANDERSON	"Great news! Thank you, Miranda."
THOMAS JOHN ANDERSON	Thank you for saving my immortal soul.
CARRIE	In her effort to help...
CARRIE	Miranda had accidentally detonated some kind of Catholic guilt bomb.
THOMAS JOHN ANDERSON	I'm gonna go take a shower.
THOMAS JOHN ANDERSON	"When I come out, I'd kind of like it if you weren't here."
IRANDA	You got it.
CARRIE	"Six months later, that exact same speech..."
CARRIE	would find its way into Thomas John Anderson's...
CARRIE	hit-off-Broadway play Shower of Shame.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, downtown..."
CARRIE	Samantha was preparing to see God.
JAMES	I know it's only been a couple of weeks...
JAMES	"but I love you, Samantha."
SAMANTHA	I love you too.
SAMANTHA	"Oh, honey, I can't wait any longer."
SAMANTHA	Just unzip and get over here.
SAMANTHA	"Okay, I'm ready."
SAMANTHA	Put it in.
JAMES	It is in.
CARRIE	Samantha said a little prayer that he was kidding.
CARRIE	He wasn't.
CARRIE	Sunday morning. A time for rest. A time for relaxation.
CARRIE	A time for spying.
CARRIE	The plan was simple. Just get a look at the mother...
CARRIE	then Miranda and I would go for eggs.
IRANDA	Look at how crowded it is. What a sham.
CARRIE	"Will you lighten up? It's a Presbyterian church, not a Catholic one."
IRANDA	"Whatever. Catholics, Episcopalian, Buddhists, Shakers, Quakers."
IRANDA	"All the same, all designed to fuck up our sex lives."
CARRIE	"Here, pray."
CARRIE	There they are.
IRANDA	Where?
CARRIE	Right there.
CARRIE	As I watched Big standing quietly next to his mother--
CARRIE	"tall, proud, respectful--"
CARRIE	I think I fell a little bit more in love with him.
PRIEST	Let us pray.
PRIEST	We come together-
IRANDA	We're out of here.
IRANDA	Here they come. Let's make a break for it.
CARRIE	"No, they saw me. I have to say hello."
CARRIE	I can't pray and run.
CARRIE	There they are.
CARRIE	Go. I'm fine.
BIG	Aren't you the young lady who made all that noise?
CARRIE	Slippery gloves.
CARRIE	'Morning.
BIG'S MOM	good morning.
CARRIE	It's a lovely church.
BIG'S MOM	"Yes, isn't it?"
CARRIE	Don't you think it's lovely?
BIG	"Mother, this is my friend Carrie."
CARRIE	I searched her face looking for the light of recognition.
CARRIE	But there was nothing.
BIG'S MOM	I'm just going to say goodbye to the pastor. It was lovely meeting you.
BIG	"""My friend Carrie""?"
BIG	You show up at church after I asked you not to.
BIG	What are you trying to do? test me? Why all of a sudden interested in meeting my mother?
CARRIE	Why hasn't the woman even heard of me?
BIG	My mother doesn't need to meet...
BIG	another girlfriend.
CARRIE	I didn't mean--
BIG	I mean...
BIG	I'll introduce you as my girlfriend when I'm sure.
BIG	"Look, I have to do things on my time frame."
CARRIE	"""Time frame""?"
CARRIE	We've been going out for months.
CARRIE	I really don't know what else to say to you.
BIG	We'll get there. You just have to have a little faith.
CARRIE	"""Faith""?"
BIG	Yeah. Look.
BIG	In a couple of days we're going on vacation. We'll have plenty of time to talk of this.
BIG	"Right now, I've got to get my mother home. Okay?"
CARRIE	"Well, go."
CARRIE	Just go.
IRANDA	Move over.
IRANDA	I didn't leave.
IRANDA	You didn't seem fine.
CARRIE	He introduced me to his mother as a friend.
CARRIE	She never heard of me.
CARRIE	That isn't a good sign.
IRANDA	Maybe they're not that close.
CARRIE	Don't lie. You're in a church.
CARRIE	I can't get inside.
CARRIE	I don't know what else I can do.
CARRIE	Late that night in the Church of Disco...
CARRIE	Stanford invited everyone he knew...
CARRIE	to a party to introduce a new fragrance--
CARRIE	Fallen Angel.
CARRIE	"Also, he wanted to show off his new boyfriend..."
CARRIE	Allanne.
STANFORD	Isn't this fun? It's like hell with a cover charge.
STANFORD	"Carrie, this is Allanne. Carrie."
CARRIE	Hi. Nice to meet You finally.
ALLANNE	You too.
STANFORD	Did I tell you that Allanne designed the Fallen Angel bottle?
CARRIE	Yes. Congratulations.
ALLANNE	Thank you. Excuse me for a second.
ALLANNE	I just saw someone I want to say hello to.
STANFORD	So you know what we did today?
STANFORD	We shopped for Deco cabinet handles for his armoire.
STANFORD	I turned into one of those couples we hate and I'm loving it!
CARRIE	Stanford and Allanne worshiped the same God--
CARRIE	style.
STANFORD	So you all excited for the big vacaciones?
CARRIE	No. I don't know. I can't help feeling...
CARRIE	Iike it's some sort of consolation prize for not letting me in his life.
STANFORD	What is going on with you two?
CARRIE	We're not in the greatest place.
STANFORD	What happened?
CARRIE	He wouldn't introduce me to his mother.
IRANDA	Thanks.
IRANDA	Skipper. Hi.
CARRIE	It seems Stanford had invited everyone in his Rolodex.
SKIPPER	I was hoping I'd see you here.
SKIPPER	I've been totally thinking about you since we broke up.
IRANDA	You have?
SKIPPER	Totally.
SKIPPER	You look great.
IRANDA	Thanks. So do you.
CARRIE	Miranda looked at Skipper.
CARRIE	The months apart had shed a new light on him.
CARRIE	"Actually, they'd shed a new light on his shower-free feelings about sex."
CARRIE	"Later that night, the three of us tracked Samantha to the ladies' room..."
CARRIE	to get the lowdown on her love life with James.
CHARLOTTE	Here you are. We've been looking for you everywhere.
CARRIE	"So, how is everything?"
IRANDA	She means have you and James done it yet?
CARRIE	And?
SAMANTHA	It's nice.
CHARLOTTE	I'm so happy for you.
CARRIE	"Sweetie, what is it?"
SAMANTHA	Nothing.
CARRIE	What's going on? Why are you crying?
SAMANTHA	James has a small dick.
CARRIE	It's not the end of the world.
SAMANTHA	It's really small.
CHARLOTTE	how small?
SAMANTHA	Too small.
CARRIE	Size isn't everything.
SAMANTHA	Three inches?
CARRIE	Well-
SAMANTHA	Hard?
CHARLOTTE	is he a good kisser?
SAMANTHA	who the Fuck cares?
SAMANTHA	His dick is like a gherkin!
SAMANTHA	I feel so terrible. Listen to me. I'm a bad person.
IRANDA	Don't beat yourself up. You had certain expectations and you're disappointed.
SAMANTHA	Why? Why?
SAMANTHA	Why does he have to have a small dick?
SAMANTHA	I really like him.
IRANDA	I thought You loved him.
CARRIE	Look. We've all been there.
CHARLOTTE	That's for sure.
IRANDA	I was once with a guy the size of one of those little miniature golf pencils.
IRANDA	Couldn't tell if he was trying to fuck me or erase me.
CARRIE	I'm sorry. It's just
CARRIE	- It's funny.
IRANDA	Let's not lose perspective.
IRANDA	There are ways to work around this.
SAMANTHA	I don't want to work around this.
SAMANTHA	I love a big dick. I love it inside of me.
SAMANTHA	I love looking at it. I love everything about it.
SAMANTHA	"When I blow him, it's like..."
SAMANTHA	nothing.
IRANDA	can You talk to Him about it?
SAMANTHA	no.
SAMANTHA	It's the only thing we can't talk about.
SAMANTHA	What am I gonna do?
CHARLOTTE	how is he with his tongue?
CARRIE	"Charlotte left us all behind, telling us she had another party to go to."
CARRIE	She took a cab to a part of town never mentioned in the New Yorker.
CHARLOTTE	Will I ever get married?
READER	I call the power of all the saints.
READER	St. Lazarus.
READER	St. Rosa. Send me your guidance.
READER	Send me the truth.
READER	Send me an answer.
READER	No yolk.
CHARLOTTE	What does that mean?
READER	You'll never be married.
READER	You are cursed.
READER	"But do not worry. For $100 dollars, we can remove it."
CARRIE	"The entire way home, Charlotte berated herself for being so foolish."
CARRIE	She simply refused to give in to the idea...
CARRIE	that she would never get married.
CHARLOTTE	Sorry.
CARRIE	"All she had to do was keep believing, and it would happen."
CARRIE	It was 3:00 a.m. in the Church of Disco...
CARRIE	and Miranda couldn't believe what she was about to say.
IRANDA	You want to spend the night?
SKIPPER	the night? the whole night?
IRANDA	"Yeah, the whole night."
SKIPPER	I knew we'd get back together
IRANDA	. You did?
SKIPPER	Yep.
SKIPPER	Every night I'd light a candle and say a little prayer.
IRANDA	You're a freak.
CARRIE	Samantha tried desperately to believe that love was stronger than sex.
JAMES	Why are you crying?
JAMES	I'm just so happy.
CARRIE	I stayed up all night questioning my faith in faith.
CARRIE	"I mean, hadn't I had faith in us all along?"
CARRIE	Faith that all the withholding would stop.
CARRIE	"Faith that he'd say ""I love you."""
BIG	Let's go!
BIG	"Hey, hurry. We're gonna miss the plane."
CARRIE	"Wait, wait. Put them down a second."
CARRIE	Just put them down.
BIG	What?
CARRIE	I need a sign.
CARRIE	"I mean, you told me to have faith, but, see..."
CARRIE	"I'm kind of losing mine, so..."
CARRIE	I need a sign.
BIG	"What, like in those old religious movies? You wanna a voice from above?"
CARRIE	Just tell me I'm the one.
CARRIE	"You don't have to tell your mother or the whole world, just--"
CARRIE	Just tell me.
BIG	I can't do this.
BIG	"Carrie, Carrie. Just get in the car. Please."
CARRIE	I can't.
CARRIE	"I love you, but I can't."
BIG	So that's it?
CARRIE	"After he left, I cried for a week."
CARRIE	And then I realized I do have faith.
CARRIE	Faith in myself.
CARRIE	Faith that I would one day meet someone...
CARRIE	who would be sure that I was the one.
CARRIE	When you live on a tiny island like Manhattan the odds of bumping into the one who broke your heart are incredibly high.
CARRIE	The odds of bumping into him when you look like shit are even higher.
CARRIE	"After a break-up, certain streets, locations even times of day are off-limits."
CARRIE	The city becomes a deserted battlefield loaded with emotional land mines.
CARRIE	You have to be very careful where you step or you could be blown to pieces.
IRANDA	"Get your coat, Anne Frank, we're going out."
CARRIE	I'm really not in the mood.
IRANDA	Coat on.
IRANDA	Body out.
CARRIE	Where are we going? .
IRANDA	It's a surprise
CARRIE	Only if it's nowhere I can run into him.
IRANDA	Just when exactly do you think you're gonna be getting out of this hostage situation?
CHARLOTTE	Miranda.
IRANDA	Am I wrong?
CHARLOTTE	"Don't listen to her, it's only been a month."
CHARLOTTE	It takes half the total time you went out with someone to get over them.
CARRIE	I always like a math solution to any love problem.
CHARLOTTE	It's the break-up rule.
CHARLOTTE	You and Big only went out for a year.
CHARLOTTE	She's got five more months to get over him.
IRANDA	Cut your losses and get back in the game.
IRANDA	"When Eric and I broke up, I got over him right away."
CARRIE	I don't really remember it being like that.
CHARLOTTE	Eric who?
IRANDA	"Eric, asshole I dated a couple of years ago."
CHARLOTTE	That Eric.
CARRIE	Miranda called Eric the love of her life until he left her for another woman.
CARRIE	"Now, she almost never mentioned him."
CHARLOTTE	You can't push yourself into feeling good.
CHARLOTTE	"The only way to get over somebody is to feel really bad, cry to your girlfriends and to replay what you hated about him over and over in your head all day."
CARRIE	Yeah. That sounds about right.
IRANDA	You're too dressed up for where we're going.
CARRIE	I'll risk being overdressed vs.
CARRIE	The chance of meeting Big looking the way I feel.
CHARLOTTE	"The first meeting is the worst, you never know how to act."
CARRIE	Then there's the vomiting.
CARRIE	"If Big had any class, he would've moved away."
CARRIE	I was here first.
IRANDA	You're giving him too much power.
IRANDA	You broke up with him.
CARRIE	"Right, and that makes me what, happy?"
IRANDA	Taxi!
CARRIE	"Amazingly, Samantha was still with James."
CARRIE	A monogamous relationship for a woman whose bedroom was busier than Balducci's on a Saturday.
CHARLOTTE	Hey you lovebirds
JAMES	How are the most beautiful women in Manhattan?
IRANDA	"If we see them, I'll ask."
JAMES	Have a fun day.
JAMES	Don't let anything bad happen to my princess.
JAMES	I love you.
CHARLOTTE	"God, everything is going so great."
SAMANTHA	"Me, James, and his tiny penis: We're one big happy family."
CARRIE	"After two months, despite all his sweetness and charm Samantha still hadn't quite accepted James's shortcomings."
CARRIE	"When Miranda said, ""Get back in the game,"" she meant it."
CARRIE	"Forty minutes and a $55 cab ride later, we found ourselves at Yankee Stadium."
SAMANTHA	Who wants another?
CARRIE	Miranda was a fan of the Yankees
CARRIE	I was a fan of being able to smoke and drink at 2:00 p.m. without judgement
SAMANTHA	Beer!
CHARLOTTE	Do they have hot cocoa?
IRANDA	"Coming up to bat, the new Yankee."
IRANDA	"Just up from the Minors, single."
IRANDA	So cute.
SAMANTHA	I can barely see him.
SAMANTHA	Why are we sitting all the way up here?
CARRIE	It's the only place I can smoke without Giuliani putting me away for 10 years.
SAMANTHA	These seats suck.
SAMANTHA	This hot dog sucks.
SAMANTHA	My entire life sucks.
CHARLOTTE	Your life doesn't suck.
CHARLOTTE	You have a man who loves you.
CARRIE	Love! Woo!
SAMANTHA	I don't think you ladies understand the seriousness of my situation.
SAMANTHA	How would you like to make love to this every night?
CARRIE	Is it kosher?
SAMANTHA	Don't make me laugh.
SAMANTHA	It's tragic.
IRANDA	Can we try and get into the game for a second? C'mon! Show us what you got.
IRANDA	Last year this guy was Mr.
IRANDA	September.
IRANDA	He hit ten home runs in nine days.
IRANDA	Ball! Good eye! Way to watch them.
IRANDA	He batted 373.
IRANDA	He drove in 47 runs.
IRANDA	His on-base percentage was 410.
CARRIE	As Miranda went on about the new Yankee's stats I couldn 't help wondering about my own.
CARRIE	Ten years playing in New York.
CARRIE	Countless dates.
CARRIE	Five real relationships.
CARRIE	One serious.
CARRIE	All ending in break-ups.
CARRIE	If I were a ballplayer I'd be batting Whatever really bad is.
IRANDA	My God! Here it comes! You got it! Do you know what the odds of catching a fly ball are?
CARRIE	I didn't. But I couldn't help wondering if they were any higher than finding a relationship that would last.
CARRIE	"Three innings, four beers and one shameless flash of my press pass later We waited outside the locker room to get my ball signed by the new Yankee."
IRANDA	Good game.
SAMANTHA	Did you see that bulge? He was wearing a cup.
SAMANTHA	His cup runneth over.
IRANDA	"It's official, you're drunk."
CARRIE	"I'm not drunk, I'm sedated from my pain."
CHARLOTTE	"She's allowed to be drunk, she's going through a break-up."
IRANDA	Excuse me.
IRANDA	Huge Yankee fan.
IRANDA	We don't mean to bother you but my friend caught your ball.
IRANDA	This is her.
CARRIE	I'm her friend.
IRANDA	We were wondering if you'd sign it?
YANKEE JOE	That foul ball to the upper deck?
IRANDA	Yes. I mean Yes.
IRANDA	If it's not too - I'm a huge Yankees fan.
IRANDA	I'm a lawyer.
YANKEE JOE	"If I don't sign it, you'll sue me?"
IRANDA	No. I don't know why I said that.
YANKEE JOE	"No problem, give me the ball."
IRANDA	Give him the ball.
CARRIE	Could you hold these?
YANKEE JOE	Sure.
YANKEE JOE	"You a Yankees fan, too?"
CARRIE	"No, I came for the beer."
CARRIE	I think baseball's a little dull.
YANKEE JOE	What do You do?
IRANDA	She writes a column.
SAMANTHA	A sex column.
YANKEE JOE	Nothin' dull about that.
CARRIE	You'd be surprised.
YANKEE JOE	here You go.
CARRIE	Thank you.
IRANDA	He's so cute.
CARRIE	I'm gonna ask him to the Dolce & Gabbana party.
IRANDA	"What? No, really, you can't."
CARRIE	Yankee! I don't know if it was the beer or the fact that I was holding his ball.
CARRIE	Something gave me the strength to ask the new Yankee out.
IRANDA	No.
IRANDA	This is not fair.
IRANDA	This is not the way this is supposed to happen.
CARRIE	Why? You told me to get back in the game.
IRANDA	With some balding C.P.A.
IRANDA	Or other boring rebound guy.
IRANDA	Nobody rebounds with the new Yankee.
CARRIE	Maybe I'm the new Carrie.
CARRIE	Let's blow this hot dog stand.
IRANDA	"Samantha, let's go."
CARRIE	"She knew it was risky, but a day of watching big men swing their big wooden bats proved to be too much for Samantha."
CARRIE	She told herself there's no harm in just looking.
LARGE BASEBALL PLAYER	Can I help you?
CARRIE	As my ballpark cheap beer buzz wore off I began to worry about the ramifications of my day.
CARRIE	"Was Charlotte right? Were we supposed to get over an ex in a slow, painful way? Or should we ignore all the bad feelings and throw ourselves back in the game?"
CARRIE	In a world where leaving each other seems to be getting more frequent What are the break-up rules?
POT HEAD LOSER GUY	"Whatever you do, man, don't cry. Cause if you do get back together again, then, you're the guy that cried."
WOMAN #1	Don't call or see him 'til three months have passed and you've lost the weight you put on while breaking up.
LARGE BASEBALL PLAYER	"Give her whatever she wants, but don't sign a motherfucking thing."
VENDOR WOMAN	"Change your name, change your phone number."
VENDOR WOMAN	Change your job.
VENDOR WOMAN	They're all bums.
VENDOR WOMAN	You got a problem?
CARRIE	"Friday night, the Dolce & Gabbana party. The new Yankee was 10 minutes late."
CARRIE	I was running 20 behind.
CARRIE	"I was reaching for my favorite necklace when I thought I'd destroyed all the evidence, but there it was."
CARRIE	We'd taken it with a disposable camera before it ever dawned on me that we could be disposable as well.
CARRIE	It was then and there I created my own very first break-up rule: Destroy all pictures where he looks sexy and you look happy.
CARRIE	The party was a complete home run.
CARRIE	All the fashion heavy-hitters were there.
CARRIE	Charlotte was dating Paul Ericson the V.P.
CARRIE	Of a major recording label's classical and jazz division.
PAUL ERICSON	Having a good time?
PAUL ERICSON	You won't believe it. This guy's never heard Miles Davis.
YANKEE JOE	I don't really like that jazz stuff.
PAUL ERICSON	I'm gonna give you our Best of Miles Davis CD.
PAUL ERICSON	His stuff will change your mind.
PAUL ERICSON	His concentration and emotion in the phrasing It's fucking magical.
CARRIE	"He was handsome, smart, eclectic."
CARRIE	The perfect match for Charlotte.
CARRIE	Except for one minor snag.
PAUL ERICSON	The authenticity of Miles' timbre is gonna blow you away.
PAUL ERICSON	The fusion revolution changed the entire concept of contemporary music.
CARRIE	"There we were, two single gals out on the town with our ballplayers."
CHARLOTTE	What's wrong?
CARRIE	I thought I saw
CHARLOTTE	Where?
CARRIE	"No, it wasn't him."
CHARLOTTE	Do you think he'll be here?
CARRIE	"I don't know, I hadn't thought about it."
CARRIE	Break-up rule number two: Lie.
CARRIE	It's a lot easier than admitting that's why you invited the new Yankee and why you maxed out your credit card to buy the dress.
CARRIE	When Mr.
CARRIE	"Big never made an appearance, I decided to make the best of it."
CARRIE	I actually got to know a little about this new Yankee.
CARRIE	His name was Joe.
CARRIE	"So, Joe, the new Yankee How'd you like your first fashion party?"
YANKEE JOE	It was kind of cool. What?
CARRIE	"Nothing. It's just ""Kind of cool."
CARRIE	""" You're very succinct."
YANKEE JOE	Are you making fun of me?
CARRIE	A little bit.
YANKEE JOE	You're kind of cute.
CARRIE	"You're kind of cute, too."
CARRIE	"And there, in the shadow of my island just four weeks out of my last relationship I let the new Yankee get to first base."
CARRIE	"Our Saturday morning ritual: Coffee, eggs, and a very private dish session."
CARRIE	Today our dish wasn't so private.
CHARLOTTE	You're on page six.
CHARLOTTE	"""Hot Yankee Joe Stark on the town with New York columnist ""and 'sex-pert', Carrie Bradshaw."
CARRIE	""" It's a proud day for me."
SAMANTHA	That dress just paid for itself.
SAMANTHA	Big is gonna see this and die.
CARRIE	I don't want him to die.
SAMANTHA	"Cut the shit, it's me."
SAMANTHA	You're using that Yankee.
IRANDA	Everybody has got to look at my new Palm Pilot.
IRANDA	It's amazing.
CHARLOTTE	this is So great.
CHARLOTTE	"The first time Big sees you, you look great and you're with the Yankee."
IRANDA	Why are we still talking about him? He hurt her.
IRANDA	He's out of the picture.
IRANDA	"Let's talk about something else, okay?"
CHARLOTTE	I have a problem with my boyfriend.
IRANDA	I'm gonna go get the check.
CHARLOTTE	"I don't know really quite how to say this, but he's always touching his"
SAMANTHA	"Balls. I know, Carrie told me."
CARRIE	It freaked me out.
CARRIE	I didn't know what the hell was going on.
CARRIE	I still don't.
CARRIE	What is?
CHARLOTTE	I don't know but it's constant. He can't seem to leave them alone.
SAMANTHA	He and every other guy on the planet.
SAMANTHA	They always try to pull our attention there.
SAMANTHA	"""Look what I got."
CHARLOTTE	""" I don't get it."
CHARLOTTE	He's from a good family.
CHARLOTTE	He went to Brown.
CHARLOTTE	Why is he doing that?
SAMANTHA	Does he have low -hangers?
CARRIE	is That a patented phrase?
SAMANTHA	"Sometimes they hang so low, they get in the way. I heard Nick Nolte had a ball lift."
CHARLOTTE	I don't know how long they are.
SAMANTHA	You've been dating for three weeks and you haven't seen his balls yet? Get with the program.
CHARLOTTE	But why do men do this? How would they feel if we stood around in public touching ourselves?
CARRIE AND SAMANTHA	They'd love it.
IRANDA	What are we talking about?
CARRIE	Charlotte's boyfriend's balls.
IRANDA	Seriously?
SAMANTHA	They're too long.
CHARLOTTE	She's just guessing.
IRANDA	Okay.
IRANDA	That's it.
IRANDA	I'm out of here.
IRANDA	All we talk about anymore is Big or balls or small dicks.
IRANDA	Why do four smart women have nothing to talk about but boyfriends? It's like seventh grade with bank accounts.
IRANDA	"What about us? What we think, we feel, we know Christ! Does it always have to be about them? Give me a call when you're ready to talk about something besides men for a change."
CARRIE	In the case of Miranda Hobbes vs.
CARRIE	"Silly women everywhere, the verdict was in."
CARRIE	Guilty as charged.
CARRIE	"After breakfast, Charlotte and I went shopping."
CARRIE	"Break-up rule number three: Until emotionally stabilized, enter no stores."
CARRIE	"Later, Samantha and James were about to enter the seventh inning stretch."
SAMANTHA	"When I arch my back, I want you to lift that ass and really give it to me."
CARRIE	"Rather than quit mid-season, Samantha decided to attack her problem with the gusto of a seasoned coach training a rookie."
SAMANTHA	"Go, go, lift."
SAMANTHA	Lift that ass.
SAMANTHA	Give it to me!
CARRIE	A good coach encourages and motivates.
SAMANTHA	You are so hot.
SAMANTHA	Fuck me.
SAMANTHA	You hot stud.
CARRIE	A good coach disciplines and criticizes.
SAMANTHA	No.
SAMANTHA	What are you doing back there? Let's go.
CARRIE	And like every good coach she passed on the benefits of her years of experience.
SAMANTHA	"Baby, I'm close."
SAMANTHA	Get up here and slide inside of me.
SAMANTHA	"Hurry, slide, slide, slide!"
CARRIE	"Then, at the bottom of the ninth try, with two balls and two strikes."
CARRIE	"The coach had no choice, but to bring in a pinch hitter."
JAMES	What's that?
SAMANTHA	It's my vibrator. I thought it would be fun.
JAMES	I think just us might be more fun.
JAMES	"That's not a problem, is it?"
CARRIE	But there was no joy in Mudville. Mighty Samantha had struck out.
CARRIE	"But a little further uptown, the ball game was just getting started."
CHARLOTTE	I have a present for you.
PAUL ERICSON	I thought you just gave me one.
CHARLOTTE	I was at Barneys today.
CHARLOTTE	Here.
CARRIE	Charlotte had decided a possible solution to her problem might be as simple as briefs vs.
CARRIE	Boxers.
CHARLOTTE	The salesman said that these were the very best.
CHARLOTTE	They're like the Wonderbra for men.
CHARLOTTE	"They give good support, something about the pouch."
PAUL ERICSON	We haven't even made love and you're out shopping for me? Slow down.
CHARLOTTE	It's not like that
PAUL ERICSON	It's what?
CARRIE	But Charlotte couldn't bring herself to tell him the problem was foul balls.
PAUL ERICSON	This is too fast.
PAUL ERICSON	Way too fast.
PAUL ERICSON	"First comes the underwear, then you move in."
PAUL ERICSON	"And then the next thing I know, you hate my music."
CARRIE	And that was that.
CARRIE	He broke it off after only three weeks.
CARRIE	"Charlotte, true to form, was over him in exactly a week and a half."
CARRIE	"Whenever Miranda was feeling stressed, she went for a long walk."
CARRIE	She'd lose herself in the places and faces and whatever was bothering her would somehow lift.
CARRIE	"But today, she would have no such luck."
YUPPIE WOMAN	I really thought he liked me. Why didn't he call me?
CARRIE	Just when Miranda decided she was the only woman in New York with any real perspective on men There he was.
CARRIE	Eric Asshole.
CARRIE	The former love of her life.
CARRIE	Walking hand and hand with the woman he left her for.
CARRIE	Somewhere between playing the Royals and the Red Sox the new Yankee found a minute to teach me some dugout pastimes.
YANKEE JOE	"One, two, three, toss."
CARRIE	Shit.
YANKEE JOE	"If you don't get this, we don't move on to spitting."
CARRIE	Hold my beer.
YANKEE JOE	"back, back, back."
CARRIE	Sorry.
CARRIE	Break-up rule number four: Never stop thinking about him even for a moment because that's the moment he'll appear.
CARRIE	"As he made his way through the crowd, I felt calm."
CARRIE	I had accomplished the perfect first meeting.
CARRIE	"I looked good, I felt good, and I was with the new Yankee."
BIG	Surprise.
CARRIE	Look at you I've been
BIG	How've you
CARRIE	"good, good, Good. - Sorry. this is Joe Stark."
BIG	I know who he is.
BIG	I'm a big fan.
BIG	Good luck this season.
YANKEE JOE	Thanks.
BIG	I saw your picture in the paper.
BIG	You never looked better.
YANKEE JOE	You want another round?
YANKEE JOE	Some buddies are at a bar on Bleeker. How about it?
CARRIE	Sure.
CARRIE	I'm sorry.
CARRIE	"I'm really sorry, it's not you."
CARRIE	This is This is really embarrassing.
CARRIE	I'm sorry.
CARRIE	I'm really embarrassed.
YANKEE JOE	You're okay.
CARRIE	I don't think I'm okay.
CARRIE	I just I just cried in your mouth.
CARRIE	I just I can't I'm not ready.
CARRIE	That guy in the bar That suit guy.
CARRIE	I better go.
CARRIE	Sorry.
YANKEE JOE	You want a ride home?
CARRIE	"No, please. Don't pay any more attention to me."
CARRIE	"Just go, please."
CARRIE	Go to that bar thing.
CARRIE	"I'm just gonna get a cab, all right? Please."
CARRIE	"Will you just go? All right, then I'll go."
CARRIE	But I didn't go home.
CARRIE	I couldn't.
CARRIE	I went to a pay phone.
CARRIE	It's me.
CARRIE	"Hi, listen."
CARRIE	I know things are really weird between us right now.
CARRIE	But I really need to talk.
CARRIE	Can you Will you meet me at our place in 15 minutes? Okay.
CARRIE	I saw Big.
CARRIE	And I completely fell apart.
CARRIE	I know you want me to be over him I'm a jerk.
IRANDA	That's my stuff.
IRANDA	It's not you.
IRANDA	I saw Eric on the street today.
IRANDA	And I hid.
IRANDA	After two years.
IRANDA	I forgot how hard it is.
IRANDA	"Just take all the time you need, okay?"
CARRIE	These are cold.
IRANDA	So?
CARRIE	"And finally, the most important break-up rule: No matter who broke your heart or how long it takes to heal you'll never get through it without your friends."
CARRIE	"Two years ago, my friend Susan-Sharon the East Coast rep for a line of Italian cashmere sportswear married a mean man."
RICHARD	What did I tell you about listening to my CDs? You put Natalie Imbruglia back in U2!
CARRIE	"Now, I only see her once or twice a year generally when her husband is out of town."
SUSAN-SHARON	"Now, I can't remember if I've taken my Halcion before dinner or not."
SUSAN-SHARON	"So I take another one, I have a cocktail, I'm feeling no pain."
SUSAN-SHARON	"The next thing I know, this freaked out stewardess is slapping me awake."
SUSAN-SHARON	"I open my eyes, I look around the plane, it's completely empty."
SUSAN-SHARON	We'd landed in Milan 30 minutes ago.
CARRIE	my god.
SUSAN-SHARON	Come up to my apartment because I have something for you.
CARRIE	The place looks fantastic!
SUSAN-SHARON	Richard's asleep.
CARRIE	In here? Susan-Sharon and her husband had one of those very adult apartments that made me feel like I was 16 visiting the home of a friend whose parents thought I was a bad influence.
SUSAN-SHARON	"Happy birthday, Carrie."
CARRIE	You didn't have to.
SUSAN-SHARON	I know it's a little early.
CARRIE	It's beautiful.
SUSAN-SHARON	It's 100 percent Italian cashmere and light as a feather.
CARRIE	"God, I love it."
CARRIE	"It's a ""cashmere-ical."
SUSAN-SHARON	""" Guess what Barneys gets for this."
CARRIE	Don't tell me.
SUSAN-SHARON	-900
CARRIE	$900 for a scarf? No.
CARRIE	do You mind if I return it? I need cash.
SUSAN-SHARON	"Why not? Why do you think they call it ""cash-mere""?"
RICHARD	What the hell is going on?
SUSAN-SHARON	"Sorry, honey. But Carrie had this idea about returning"
RICHARD	What was our agreement about visitors after 9:00 p.m.?
SUSAN-SHARON	"I know, it's her birthday."
RICHARD	I'm on London time! I've got to be up in three hours when the markets open.
RICHARD	I'd really appreciate it if you'd take the fucking noise somewhere else.
CARRIE	I'll call you.
SUSAN-SHARON	Just ignore him.
SUSAN-SHARON	You don't have to leave.
CARRIE	It's okay.
CARRIE	"Goodnight, Grumpy."
RICHARD	Get the fuck out of my house!
CARRIE	"Taunting the psychotic spouse, I realized, was not a wise move."
RICHARD	Just shut the fuck up!
CARRIE	"I wondered could their marriage be that bad, or was their fighting a form of foreplay? In which case, I was merely the catalyst to get things going."
SUSAN-SHARON	I am so sorry.
SUSAN-SHARON	I'm so embarrassed.
CARRIE	Don't be.
CARRIE	He's just tired and cranky.
SUSAN-SHARON	"That was classic Richard: Tyrannical, emotionally abusive."
SUSAN-SHARON	I don't know what to do anymore.
CARRIE	Maybe there were special circumstances tonight.
SUSAN-SHARON	He works hard.
SUSAN-SHARON	He's sleep deprived.
SUSAN-SHARON	"Blah, blah, blah."
SUSAN-SHARON	I don't give a shit! What would you do? Would you leave?
CARRIE	If things didn't change
SUSAN-SHARON	"They haven't, and they won't. Do you think I should leave him?"
CARRIE	"If you're not happy, you know, life's too short."
SUSAN-SHARON	I gotta go.
CARRIE	"As I hung up, I realized I had been placed in a classic no-win situation."
IRANDA	Telling a friend to leave her husband is something you just don't do.
SAMANTHA	"If they do break up, it's your fault."
SAMANTHA	"If they don't, she knows you think they should and therefore, can't speak to you again."
SAMANTHA	You're screwed.
IRANDA	It's a shame.
IRANDA	There goes your cashmere connection.
CARRIE	She had me at a weak moment.
CARRIE	"I was tired, I'd been chased out of her apartment."
CARRIE	I have a birthday looming.
CARRIE	I said Too much.
CHARLOTTE	"No, in an intimate relationship You should be able to say anything."
SAMANTHA	I disagree.
SAMANTHA	Practically all the relationships I know are based on a foundation of lies and mutual delusion.
SAMANTHA	"James and me, for instance."
SAMANTHA	I pretend he doesn't have a small dick.
SAMANTHA	He pretends not to notice we haven't had sex in weeks.
CARRIE	You should join the U.N.
IRANDA	"I'm in an intimate relationship at the moment and I can tell you, the level of verbal discourse has become a little too intimate."
CARRIE	are we speaking Of Spring Roll Guy?
CHARLOTTE	Who's that?
IRANDA	Aaron Melman. He's a dermatologist I met at the Vietnamese lunch truck outside my office.
SAMANTHA	What's the problem?
CARRIE	"The problem, if you can call it that is Spring Roll Guy liked to talk dirty in bed."
AARON MELMAN	"Baby, I just love the way your pussy feels."
AARON MELMAN	So wet and warm and tight.
AARON MELMAN	Kissing your beautiful tits feels unbelievably sexy.
AARON MELMAN	So hot and nasty.
AARON MELMAN	How's it feel to you?
IRANDA	What you said.
SAMANTHA	That can be a turn on.
IRANDA	"Sure, but now he wants me to reciprocate."
IRANDA	I can't.
IRANDA	I never could.
CARRIE	Why not?
IRANDA	"Because sex is not a time to chat. It's one of the few instances in my overly articulated, exceedingly verbal life where it is perfectly appropriate, if not preferable, to shut up."
IRANDA	"Now I have to worry about being stumped for conversation? No, thank you."
CHARLOTTE	Just talk about his big cock.
SAMANTHA	"Correction, his big, beautiful cock."
CARRIE	"We're using the ""C"" word now? Sorry."
IRANDA	I can't use adjectives.
CARRIE	"A simple, ""You're so hard,"" is effective."
CHARLOTTE	Sometimes men need encouragement.
IRANDA	such as?
CHARLOTTE	"You know ""Yes, stud, that's right. ""Don't stop, just like that."
CHARLOTTE	"C'mon, fucker, don't stop."
IRANDA	""" You're kidding, right?"
CHARLOTTE	"No, they like it."
CARRIE	"So, are you really telling us that during sex you're completely mute?"
IRANDA	"No, I can do a good orgasm alert. ""I'm gonna cum, I'm gonna cum."
IRANDA	""" But that's because I'm gonna cum."
IRANDA	Anything else feels like make believe.
CHARLOTTE	"If you really like this guy, you're gonna have to start talking."
CARRIE	Was Miranda right? Have we put such a premium on being open and honest with one another that we've misplaced the boundaries of propriety? Are there still certain things in a relationship one should never say?
WOMAN #1	"My best friend got engaged to the biggest loser. What am I supposed to say? ""You're marrying an imbecile?"""
AN	"My wife, she's had her breasts done twice. They look fantastic, they feel like shit."
AN	I keep that thought to myself.
WOMAN #3	"I'm single, 38, and still hoping to get married."
WOMAN #3	I don't want to know the truth.
SUSAN-SHARON	I told Richard I couldn't spend another day married to a man who is an utter asshole.
CARRIE	"There it was, standing across from me."
CARRIE	"Biscotti-eating, cashmere-swaddled proof that I had said too much."
CARRIE	then What happened?
SUSAN-SHARON	"once I said That, the floodgates opened. he said That at our wedding, when he looked at me he felt a Huge wave Of disappointment because I looked So generic."
SUSAN-SHARON	"I said, ""On second thought ""I don't think the Rogaine is working."
SUSAN-SHARON	""" He said that if I leave, all he'll feel for me is pity because he'll be remarried within a year and I'll be single for the rest of my life."
CARRIE	I didn't want to tell Susan-Sharon that his last statement was probably true.
SUSAN-SHARON	I just feel like I owe you so much.
SUSAN-SHARON	"If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have had the guts to do this."
SUSAN-SHARON	It's like I was under house arrest for years and now I'm free.
CARRIE	What are you gonna do?
SUSAN-SHARON	Do you mind if I stay at your place?
CARRIE	"Of course not. That evening, as Susan-Sharon squatted on my couch Charlotte came home to the new male in her life."
CARRIE	"Fed up with lonely mornings, cuddle-free nights and the lack of unconditional love she longed for Charlotte took matters into her own hands."
CARRIE	"She combed the city for the perfect specimen of breeding, style and trendiness."
CHARLOTTE	"Henry, I'm home."
CHARLOTTE	"Hi, my good boy."
CARRIE	"Until she found the perfect man, Charlotte would have the perfect dog."
CARRIE	"That night, Samantha, who was never good at keeping a secret found the one thing she couldn 't say was the only thing she could think about."
JAMES	"Sweetheart, is anything wrong? If there is, I want you to tell me."
SAMANTHA	"No, honey, I'm tired."
JAMES	"I feel like you've become so distant, like you're upset with me about something."
SAMANTHA	I'm sorry.
SAMANTHA	"It's not you, it's me."
SAMANTHA	I'm not upset about anything.
SAMANTHA	You're wonderful.
JAMES	Will you come see a couple's counselor with me?
CARRIE	Samantha dreaded the shrink the way most people feared the dentist.
SAMANTHA	If it's really important to you
JAMES	Great.
SAMANTHA	Goodnight.
CARRIE	She longed for the simple days of emotional unavailability and hot one-night stands.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, across town, Miranda was appearing as Eliza Doolittle in My Filthy Lady."
AARON MELMAN	I just love kissing this sensitive spot right here.
AARON MELMAN	Do you like that? Tell me what you like.
IRANDA	That.
AARON MELMAN	"You like my hand there, caressing your breast?"
IRANDA	Sure.
AARON MELMAN	Gently pinching your nipple.
IRANDA	Fine.
AARON MELMAN	Kissing my chest.
AARON MELMAN	That's hot.
AARON MELMAN	That really turns me on.
AARON MELMAN	How's it feel? Hot?
IRANDA	Hot.
AARON MELMAN	And?
IRANDA	Hairy?
AARON MELMAN	"God, you're getting me hard. Tell me how it feels."
IRANDA	Big.
AARON MELMAN	And?
IRANDA	Hard? Rock hard.
AARON MELMAN	Keep talking.
IRANDA	A big rock.
IRANDA	A hard rock.
IRANDA	"A big, hard rock."
IRANDA	a sausage.
AARON MELMAN	"baby, You are So nasty."
CARRIE	"Surprisingly, once Miranda opened her mouth, it was difficult to shut up."
IRANDA	"A big, throbbing, rock-hard sausage."
CARRIE	"That night, I took Susan-Sharon to meet the new male in Charlotte's life."
CARRIE	"True to form, he was already falling far short of her high expectations."
CHARLOTTE	He did it a minute ago.
CARRIE	He was inconsistent
CHARLOTTE	Get the ball.
CARRIE	"selfishly stubborn, and hopelessly codependent."
CHARLOTTE	Isn't he smart?
SUSAN-SHARON	"We can't stay, I want to be at your place if Richard calls."
CARRIE	Aren't you leaving him?
SUSAN-SHARON	"If he calls, I want to say I won't talk to him."
CHARLOTTE	That's passive aggressive.
CHARLOTTE	You should only talk if you have something to say.
SUSAN-SHARON	Do you believe I married a prick?
CARRIE	You didn't know he was a prick.
SUSAN-SHARON	I just can't believe that prick hasn't called.
SUSAN-SHARON	"Although, he does have this sweet side."
SUSAN-SHARON	You just don't know him very well.
SUSAN-SHARON	"Did I do the right thing, Henry? Should I give him another chance"
CHARLOTTE	"He's a dog, not an oracle."
CARRIE	"The next morning, I woke up to an unsettling birthday surprise."
CARRIE	Coming.
FLOWER DELIVERY 	Sign here.
CARRIE	Thank you.
CARRIE	My God.
SAMANTHA	"""Best wishes on your birthday."
CARRIE	""" It's from Big."
SAMANTHA	What kind Of flowers?
CARRIE	"Roses, red. Big."
CARRIE	Expensive. What do you think it means?
IRANDA	It means rip up the card.
SAMANTHA	And watch out for the thorns.
CHARLOTTE	"No, this is the grand gesture."
IRANDA	The grand gesture?
CHARLOTTE	"If you break up, and he disappears from your life it wasn't meant to be. But if they make a powerful declaration of their love, then you have to reconsider."
IRANDA	"You think a dozen roses and a card saying, ""Best wishes"" qualifies as a grand gesture?"
CHARLOTTE	"You know men. They can never say, ""I was wrong."
CHARLOTTE	""" They just send flowers."
IRANDA	Sometimes a rose is just a rose.
SAMANTHA	"Jewelry, that's another story."
CHARLOTTE	"Henry, no."
CHARLOTTE	"Henry, no, not the purse."
CARRIE	I really don't need this on my birthday.
CARRIE	"What does this mean, the ball's in my court or something? I don't want to play games."
CARRIE	This is not the grand gesture.
CARRIE	This is the vague gesture which is worse than no gesture.
SAMANTHA	"Under the guise of thoughtfulness, he's being very selfish."
IRANDA	"I agree, he's muddied the waters."
CHARLOTTE	You're all just cuckoo.
CHARLOTTE	He sends flowers on her birthday and you condemn him.
CHARLOTTE	"Henry, no."
CHARLOTTE	"No, damn it."
SAMANTHA	"For chrissake, give the dog a break."
CHARLOTTE	He's eaten four pairs of shoes.
CHARLOTTE	I don't want him starting on purses.
CHARLOTTE	"Damn it, now."
CHARLOTTE	We're gonna go home.
CHARLOTTE	"You wanted to get out and socialize, but you'll have to learn to behave."
IRANDA	Speaking of cuckoo
CARRIE	Charlotte was at the point where she was starting to see the real Henry. But she did raise a valid question.
CARRIE	"Was, ""I was wrong,"" the one thing Mr."
CARRIE	Big couldn 't say? I realized that just because we were no longer together didn 't mean I couldn 't be polite.
CARRIE	It's me.
CARRIE	Carrie.
BIG	How are you?
CARRIE	Great. I wanted to call and thank you for the flowers.
CARRIE	That was thoughtful of you.
BIG	"My secretary had it on her calendar, so I, you know"
CARRIE	Your secretary sent them?
BIG	"I sent the flowers, my secretary alerted me to the day."
CARRIE	That was very thoughtful of her and you for sending them.
BIG	You're welcome. What are you doing on the big day?
CARRIE	"Stanford's arranged this party down at Layla, that Moroccan restaurant."
CARRIE	You should come.
CARRIE	"The instant the words popped out of my mouth, I regretted them."
BIG	I made plans already.
CARRIE	Or not.
CARRIE	"I mean, just forget it."
BIG	I could stop by later.
CARRIE	Fine.
CARRIE	Whatever.
BIG	I may bring someone.
CARRIE	Come and bring that person and maybe I'll see you later.
CARRIE	Thank you again for the thoughtful flowers.
CARRIE	I couldn't believe it.
CARRIE	I had just invited my ex and his date to my birthday party.
CARRIE	As if getting older wasn't traumatic enough.
CARRIE	That afternoon in the office of Velma Rudin celebrated psychologist and author of In-to-me-see A Couple's Guide to Intimacy Samantha did her best not to say the thing she knew she shouldn 't say.
JAMES	I've noticed that our sex life has diminished.
SAMANTHA	"That's normal, isn't it? I mean, after a while"
VELMA RUDIN	How long has it been?
JAMES	A month.
VELMA RUDIN	Have fun with your sexuality.
VELMA RUDIN	Have you tried playing erotic games?
CARRIE	"Samantha almost confessed that James had been playing ""hide the salami"" since they met."
SAMANTHA	I'm just not feeling very sexual these days.
JAMES	I saw you masturbating the other day when I came out of the shower.
VELMA RUDIN	Many women are simply unable to achieve orgasm through intercourse.
VELMA RUDIN	It's nothing to be ashamed of.
JAMES	You have a problem with intimacy.
SAMANTHA	"No, that's not it."
JAMES	What is it?
SAMANTHA	It's nothing.
JAMES	"Nothing you say can hurt me, as long as it's what you're feeling."
VELMA RUDIN	That seems to be all the time we have for today.
VELMA RUDIN	"Nice work, you two."
VELMA RUDIN	"Shall we say next week, same time?"
JAMES	Good for me.
CARRIE	"The idea of seeing Velma ""In-to-me-see"" Rudin on a weekly basis was much more than Samantha could bear."
SAMANTHA	Your penis is too small.
JAMES	Excuse me?
SAMANTHA	It doesn't and it just it can't. I can't.
SAMANTHA	It's just too damn small.
JAMES	Did you ever stop to think that maybe your vagina is too big?
SAMANTHA	What can I say? I need a big dick.
VELMA RUDIN	I hear that.
CARRIE	As Samantha paid the price of mentioning the unmentionable Miranda discovered that free speech comes with a cost of its own.
IRANDA	I just love putting my hand around your cock.
AARON MELMAN	"I just love hearing you say ""cock."
IRANDA	""" Your big hard cock."
IRANDA	"Cock, cock, cock."
IRANDA	Why couldn't I ever say that before? It's just a word.
IRANDA	Why does it turn us both on when I say it?
AARON MELMAN	What else do you like?
IRANDA	"I like it when you're rough. When you throw my legs over your head, I lose control."
AARON MELMAN	What do I like?
IRANDA	You like it when I'm biting your nipple.
AARON MELMAN	What else?
IRANDA	You like it when I'm kissing your balls.
AARON MELMAN	Keep going.
IRANDA	You really like it when I slip my finger in your ass.
AARON MELMAN	Excuse me?
IRANDA	You just love a finger in your ass.
IRANDA	"How could I know, ""You love a finger in your ass"" is the one thing you can't say?"
SAMANTHA	"Trust me, that's not the only thing."
IRANDA	"But it's true, he enjoys it."
SUSAN-SHARON	So do a lot Of men.
CARRIE	"They enjoy it, but don't want it brought to their attention."
STANFORD BLATCH	"Personally, I don't like anything in my ass."
STANFORD BLATCH	I know that may come as a surprise.
IRANDA	I just feel so betrayed.
IRANDA	"He wanted me to talk dirty, I got into it, then he pulled the rug out from under me."
CHARLOTTE	Men are so frustratingly inconsistent.
CHARLOTTE	That's why I love my Henry.
CHARLOTTE	He's a big love bug.
CHARLOTTE	You tell him anything and he licks your face.
CARRIE	"Charlotte, you may be onto something."
CARRIE	Another double vodka rocks for the birthday girl.
CARRIE	"The truth was, vodka was my only ally."
CARRIE	"At any moment, Big was gonna walk in with his gorgeous date smile at me like some distant stranger and say something crushing Happy birthday, baby."
CARRIE	Glad you could make it.
BIG	I can't stay long.
BIG	I left my camel outside. You remember Jack?
CARRIE	Jack is your date?
BIG	"I wasn't aware we were formally dating, but"
CARRIE	It is so good to see you again. How have you been?
R. MARVELOUS	"Marvelous, I split up with a bitch who broke my heart. She didn't get my money."
CARRIE	Happy birthday to me.
CARRIE	"An hour later, my Arabian Nights fantasy birthday felt like Midnight Express."
BIG	how are you?
CARRIE	great. how are you?
BIG	Good. Fine.
CARRIE	Good.
IRANDA	"Excuse me, what is your ex doing at your birthday?"
CARRIE	I told him to drop by for a drink. I didn't think he'd stay for a lap dance.
SUSAN-SHARON	"My God, have you tried the baba ganooj? It is to die for."
R. MARVELOUS	I don't eat baba ganooj.
SUSAN-SHARON	You don't know what you're missing.
STANFORD BLATCH	I can't believe the bastard dared to come.
CHARLOTTE	I can't believe what she does with her navel.
STANFORD BLATCH	"Please, I'm about to lose my couscous."
CARRIE	While I watched my ex get a Mesopotamian lap dance Susan-Sharon made a play for Mr.
CARRIE	Marvelous.
SUSAN-SHARON	I can't deal with being single all over again.
SUSAN-SHARON	Every relationship has its ups and downs.
SUSAN-SHARON	My husband and I work very hard.
SUSAN-SHARON	We probably don't spend enough damn time together.
SUSAN-SHARON	Compounded by the fact that neither of us gets enough sleep.
SUSAN-SHARON	"Then again, who does? I really never imagined myself as a divorcee, you know? It's more important to till your own soil than to go in search of greener pastures."
R. MARVELOUS	Do you ever shut the fuck up?
CARRIE	"In that moment, Susan-Sharon realized she desperately missed her husband. That night, Charlotte came home to a very unpleasant surprise."
CHARLOTTE	Bad!
CARRIE	He and Charlotte soon parted ways.
CARRIE	"The one thing she could never say was, ""I got rid of the puppy."
CARRIE	""" We all know what happened to him."
CARRIE	He'd become the glue that put Susan-Sharon and her husband back together.
RICHARD	Shut up.
RICHARD	Shut the fuck up.
CARRIE	Although neither of them could admit that a dog saved their marriage.
CARRIE	"Later that evening, as my birthday passed into the early hours of just another day I found myself alone on the street with Mr."
CARRIE	Big.
BIG	Another year older.
CARRIE	And none the wiser.
BIG	That's the way it goes.
BIG	can I Give You a ride home?
CARRIE	"No, I'm just gonna grab a cab."
BIG	do You need cab fare?
CARRIE	"No, I'm okay."
BIG	"Good, because I think I left all my $20 in that belly dancer's crotch."
CARRIE	Goodnight.
BIG	Goodnight.
CARRIE	"As I watched him go, I realized the one thing I couldn't say to Mr."
CARRIE	"Big was ""I'm still not over you."""
	""""
CARRIE	"Manhattan, for millions of our forefathers, the gateway to hope opportunity and happiness beyond their wildest dreams."
CARRIE	"Today, that hope is still alive."
CARRIE	It's called The First Date.
CARRIE	"On Saturday nights, every restaurant in Lower Manhattan resembles its own little Ellis Island."
CARRIE	"Hordes of single women crowded into a hot, cramped space hoping to make it to their final destination: The state of matrimony."
CARRIE	Or at least to get a hot meal in transit.
CARRIE	Samantha didn't believe in The First Date.
CARRIE	But she did believe in sex after it.
HARRISON	I think you missed a drop.
CARRIE	Harrison was a very successful litigator who took steam baths with Ron Perlman and owned an apartment on the 39th floor of Museum Tower.
CARRIE	An excellent first-date pedigree.
CARRIE	"After dinner, Harrison invited Samantha up to see his view."
HARRISON	I think you should know my specialty is sexual harassment.
SAMANTHA	Really.
SAMANTHA	So is mine.
HARRISON	This is a classic case: A classic case of entrapment.
HARRISON	"Beautiful woman, mind-altering wine I could claim temporary insanity."
SAMANTHA	I do have a prior record of driving men a little crazy.
HARRISON	You fit the profile.
HARRISON	Most sexual harassment cases are brought by older women.
SAMANTHA	"I'm sorry? No offense, but what are you: 40, 41? Samantha had celebrated her 35th birthday for as long as we could remember."
SAMANTHA	I'm just gonna freshen up.
HARRISON	I think you're pretty fresh already.
HARRISON	"Hey, sexy, I'm over here."
CARRIE	"There, next to his Brooks Brothers suits was the world's smallest cedar-lined den of inequity."
HARRISON	Slap me.
SAMANTHA	You've got to be kidding.
HARRISON	C'mon.
HARRISON	Slap me hard.
CARRIE	Apparently the view left a little to be desired.
CARRIE	"The next night, Samantha invited us to a party she was throwing for the new coffee-table book du jour."
CARRIE	"The book was awful, but the hors d'oeuvres were fabulous."
CARRIE	Give him credit.
CARRIE	Takes a lot of work to get rigged up like that.
IRANDA	Most of my first dates don't even open the cab door.
CARRIE	What if he's still hanging there?
SAMANTHA	The super'd find him eventually.
IRANDA	"You see, this is why I don't date."
IRANDA	The men out there are freaks.
CARRIE	That's completely unfair.
IRANDA	"If a man is over 30 and single, there's something wrong with him."
IRANDA	It's Darwinian.
IRANDA	They're being weeded out from propagating the species.
CARRIE	What about Us?
IRANDA	We're just choosey. I'm getting more shrimp.
SAMANTHA	You know what the worst part of the date was? Harrison actually thought I was 40.
CARRIE	Really?
SAMANTHA	Really. Do you think I look 40?
CARRIE	If Samantha's past four birthdays taught me anything it was that there is only one answer to this question. You don't look a day over 35.
CHARLOTTE	This is a great party.
CHARLOTTE	"I just met the most amazing guy, Mitchell Saylor."
CARRIE	"When Charlotte really liked a guy, she said his whole name."
CARRIE	It helped her to imagine their future monogrammed towels.
SAMANTHA	Mitch Saylor?
CHARLOTTE	"Yeah, do You know him?"
SAMANTHA	"honey, I know Of him."
CHARLOTTE	What is that supposed to mean?
SAMANTHA	"Ladies, I suggest you join me in the bathroom. He's Mr. Pussy."
CHARLOTTE	Mr. Who?
CARRIE	"Suddenly, Charlotte's towels were looking very different."
SAMANTHA	"He's renowned, he loves going down on women."
CARRIE	He's so cute to be so nasty.
CHARLOTTE	That's disgusting!
IRANDA	I told you there'd be something.
SAMANTHA	He's a legend.
SAMANTHA	He's just amazing at eating pussy.
CHARLOTTE	Would You Please Stop calling It that?
SAMANTHA	"Fine. going down, giving head."
CARRIE	Eating out?
IRANDA	I never understood that. Shouldn't it be eating in?
CHARLOTTE	Stop it! Stop it!
SAMANTHA	"You do do That, right?"
CHARLOTTE	Of course! I don't have to talk about it.
CARRIE	"Reality was, the only thing that went down with regularity on Charlotte's dates was a Gold American Express card."
CHARLOTTE	Forget it.
CHARLOTTE	I'm not dating anyone who is known as Mr. Pussy.
SAMANTHA	Why not?
CHARLOTTE	Maybe I want more than that.
SAMANTHA	"Sweetie, if a man is good at that, there is nothing more."
CARRIE AND MIRANDA	Amen.
WOMAN IN BATHROOM	You have to be talking about Mitch Saylor.
WOMAN IN BATHROOM	He's unbelievable.
WOMAN IN BATHROOM	I dated him for a month.
WOMAN IN BATHROOM	"He was so good, I actually passed out when I came."
WOMAN IN BATHROOM	Enjoy.
CARRIE	The guy's got good word of mouth.
IRANDA	"My God, right over there."
IRANDA	That's him.
CARRIE	"Unlike Miranda, I wasn't ready to accept that all single men were freaks."
CARRIE	"I was so optimistic, I had actually agreed to go on my first blind date in two years."
CARRIE	P.J was a very successful independent-movie producer.
CARRIE	His documentary on endangered seagulls had just aired to excellent reviews on PBS.
CARRIE	"So, documentary films."
CARRIE	That must be fun.
DATE #1	Let's be realistic.
DATE #1	I'm only doing this docu bullshit to earn a rep.
DATE #1	"Ultimately, I want to parlay into the action-movie arena to make money."
DATE #1	I'm not afraid to say it.
DATE #1	I love money.
DATE #1	I'd sell toilet bowls if it'd make me a millionaire.
CARRIE	What about the seagulls?
DATE #1	Fuck the seagulls.
CARRIE	"Step right up, folks."
CARRIE	Two vodkas and a $12 pasta buys your admission to see The Man With No Soul.
CARRIE	"Observe if you dare, this chilling sight."
CARRIE	Bachelor Number Two seemed promising.
CARRIE	"Just so you know, I can't see a movie without popcorn."
DATE #2	I'm a Junior Mints kind of guy.
DATE #2	This relationship is probably doomed.
DATE #2	"You want to lean a little closer? Maybe hear our entire conversation? Why don't you and your fucking girlfriend just sit on our laps at the movie? Then you won't miss a fucking word, dick!"
CARRIE	"Ladies and gentlemen, stand far away from The Man With Two Faces. They say the third time's the charm."
CARRIE	Max was a broker who made $2 million on bonds last year.
CARRIE	We had a great dinner in Little Italy.
CARRIE	Not only did Max have $2 million he also appeared to have a lending library in his pants.
CARRIE	"Parents, please keep the kiddies away from the cage of The Man Who Steals Cheap Used Books for No Reason."
CARRIE	"Okay, now I was afraid."
CARRIE	Apparently the men in the dating world had devolved since the last time I visited.
CARRIE	Maybe Miranda was right.
CARRIE	They never should've outlawed freak shows because at least then the freaks were rounded up in one place.
CARRIE	"Now they're out there among us, roaming free."
CARRIE	Is it true? Are all men freaks? Apparently Charlotte's week went a little better than mine.
CARRIE	"On Monday night, she was finally ready to let Mitch under her sheets way under."
CHARLOTTE	Sorry.
CHARLOTTE	It tickles.
ITCHELL SAILOR	Just relax.
ITCHELL SAILOR	Relax.
CARRIE	That night Charlotte came harder than she ever had before.
CARRIE	"That is, until Tuesday."
CHARLOTTE	Yes!
CARRIE	Wednesday. Thursday.
CARRIE	Friday.
CHARLOTTE	Oh God!
CARRIE	Friday
CHARLOTTE	Oh God!
CARRIE	Friday.
CARRIE	"That night, Charlotte saw God seven times."
CARRIE	"For a lapsed Episcopalian, it was a very Good Friday."
CARRIE	"If Mitch was a freak, Charlotte was ready to run away and join the circus."
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, all I wanted to do was run away."
BEN	Rough night?
CARRIE	Bad date.
BEN	Been there.
CARRIE	He was a kleptomaniac.
BEN	"Last month, I went out with a woman who slept with her shoes on."
CARRIE	"Hi, Carrie."
BEN	Ben.
CARRIE	I was instantly attracted.
CARRIE	But I was pretty sure I could feel webs between his fingers.
CARRIE	So when did you guys all become freaks?
BEN	Us? No. The Shoe Woman seemed totally normal.
BEN	"Then a month in, I discover she's a freak."
BEN	They hide it really well.
BEN	That's why I don't date anymore.
BEN	Women are bizarre.
CARRIE	Thank you.
BEN	Sometimes in a good way.
CARRIE	I once saw the world's fattest twins at a state fair.
CARRIE	They were both married.
CARRIE	Their wives were very skinny.
BEN	Maybe It was an optical illusion.
CARRIE	Maybe.
BEN	Would You have dinner with me?
CARRIE	I thought you didn't date.
BEN	I don't. It would be a non-date.
CARRIE	a non -date. Maybe
BEN	is That a Yes?
CARRIE	Let's call it a non-no.
CARRIE	And it was then that the most freaky thing happened.
CARRIE	There in the middle of Manhattan two complete strangers gave out their unlisted phone numbers.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, Samantha was about to have her own chance encounter."
ONICA	Samantha?
SAMANTHA	Monica. - look at you.
SAMANTHA	You look amazing.
ONICA	Don't I? It's the work.
ONICA	I had the fat from my ass injected into my face.
ONICA	"Look, like a baby's bottom."
SAMANTHA	Unbelievable.
ONICA	Isn't it? Fat from my own ass.
ONICA	"The best part is, you get to eat like a pig before, fatten up your ass and then a week later it's in your face."
ONICA	"Gotta go, bye."
CARRIE	"An hour later, Samantha had her first Big Mac and an appointment with the most expensive plastic surgeon on Upper Fifth."
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, I had my own ass to be obsessed with and it belonged to Ben an editor at a hip political magazine, who made me laugh."
CARRIE	This is me.
BEN	Then I guess this is goodnight.
BEN	"Normally I'd try to get upstairs, but since this is a non-date"
CARRIE	So no kiss.
BEN	Maybe a non-kiss.
CARRIE	"There was nothing ""non"" about it."
CARRIE	A week and three non-dates later Samantha summoned us to make an announcement.
IRANDA	You've got to be kidding.
SAMANTHA	It's sitting in a fat repository in Queens as we speak.
SAMANTHA	"And in three days, it will be in my face and I will look fabulous."
IRANDA	I can't believe it.
IRANDA	We spend our lives trying to hide the fat in our ass and you're putting it right on your face?
SAMANTHA	I just have to wear this girdle for a week to keep my skin tight.
IRANDA	Look at that.
CARRIE	That's a girdle with a hole.
SAMANTHA	Of course it has a hole.
SAMANTHA	"It's for peeing, etcetera."
CHARLOTTE	Etcetera?
SAMANTHA	Last night I slept with a Calvin Klein model. I've never felt sexier.
IRANDA	I think the fat's already gone to your head.
CHARLOTTE	Could you put your skirt down?
IRANDA	Whatever happened to aging gracefully?
CARRIE	It got old.
CHARLOTTE	I got to go.
CHARLOTTE	I'm meeting Mitch at my apartment.
CARRIE	So how is he? -
CHARLOTTE	He is amazing. He makes me happy.
CHARLOTTE	I think we have a chance at a future together.
CARRIE	You and Mr.
CARRIE	Pussy.
CHARLOTTE	his name is Mitchell.
SAMANTHA	"Hang on, honey."
SAMANTHA	You don't fall in love with Mr.
SAMANTHA	Pussy.
SAMANTHA	You enjoy him and then set him free.
CARRIE	"To Samantha, Charlotte had committed the ultimate sin."
CARRIE	She was Bogarting Mr.
CARRIE	Pussy.
IRANDA	"He's a freak! Aside from technique, what do you know about him? Do you talk?"
SAMANTHA	do You even fuck?
CHARLOTTE	Stop it.
CARRIE	"sweetie, Miranda has a point."
CARRIE	"Have you guys had dinner together? Have you seen a play, anything?"
CHARLOTTE	"No, but we could."
CARRIE	You know what? You've fallen into the sex haze.
CARRIE	Where the sex is really great and you start acting like a crazy person.
CARRIE	You imagine the relationship is something it's not.
IRANDA	"Charlotte's not having a relationship, she's having multiple orgasms."
CHARLOTTE	He makes me happy.
CARRIE	"Hoping to prove Miranda wrong I had convinced her to come out on a double non-date with Ben 's friend, Luke."
CARRIE	Things were actually going remarkably well.
IRANDA	Favorite ice cream?
LUKE	Strawberry.
IRANDA	"I see, you're boring."
LUKE	I like to see It as traditional.
IRANDA	Traditional? Traditional can be good.
CARRIE	Nothing makes you feel like more of a non-couple than creating another non-couple.
CARRIE	"Unfortunately, our smugness was a little premature."
LUKE	What are You doing this weekend?
IRANDA	Big plans. I'm gonna go see my granddad in Connecticut.
LUKE	Connecticut?
IRANDA	What's wrong with Connecticut?
LUKE	I hate the country. I haven't left Manhattan in 10 years.
IRANDA	And you're proud of that?
LUKE	"Everything you want is right here. Culture, food, the Park, cabs at 3:00 a.m."
LUKE	Why leave?
IRANDA	Perhaps to experience a world outside Manhattan.
LUKE	There is no world outside Manhattan.
CARRIE	I'd unwittingly set Miranda up on a date with Manhattan Guy.
CARRIE	A genetically mutant strain of single men that fed on Zabar's and midnight shows at the Angelica.
CARRIE	"No, thanks."
IRANDA	I like the city.
IRANDA	I also happen to like the country.
IRANDA	This does not make me a freak.
LUKE	You're obviously not from here.
IRANDA	I have to go feed my cat.
CARRIE	Miranda had invoked our code phrase.
CARRIE	"Honed over years of bad parties, awful dates and unending phone calls."
CARRIE	"Unfortunately, I wasn't ready to accept defeat."
CARRIE	I thought You already fed your cat.
IRANDA	I have to feed It again.
LUKE	Cat people are freaks.
CARRIE	where are You going?
IRANDA	home. the man has not left Manhattan in a decade.
IRANDA	He's obviously a freak.
IRANDA	"And by the way, if Luke is a freak, Ben is bound to be a freak, too."
IRANDA	You can tell everything about a person by who their friends are.
CARRIE	"God, I hope not."
CARRIE	"That night, I couldn't get Miranda's freaky comment out of my head."
CARRIE	Is there anything weird about you I should know before this gets any more compromising?
BEN	"Now that you mention it, there is."
CARRIE	It's adorable.
BEN	It's a souvenir from a drunken bachelor party a few years ago.
BEN	"My friend's marriage didn't last, but Tweety Bird did."
BEN	So what about you? You're probably perfect?
CARRIE	No. Three stitches.
CARRIE	I got into a fight with a third-grade bully.
BEN	You're scrappy.
BEN	I like scrappy.
CARRIE	And then The Amazing Tattooed Man made love to me.
CARRIE	And it didn't feel weird at all.
CARRIE	While Miranda was busy feeding her pussy Charlotte was trying to do everything but.
CHARLOTTE	Did you ever go to summer camp?
CARRIE	"There, over the exotic-fruit plate Charlotte tried to make a relationship happen."
CHARLOTTE	I loved camp.
CHARLOTTE	I went to this place in Maine called Minihaha.
CHARLOTTE	We used to play these big games of color war.
CHARLOTTE	I was always a Red.
CHARLOTTE	It was so much fun.
CHARLOTTE	And then they made us stop because they said that it glorified warfare.
CHARLOTTE	You're awfully quiet tonight.
CARRIE	What are you thinking about? Charlotte realized Miranda was right.
CARRIE	She had stayed too long at the fair.
CARRIE	"From that moment on, Charlotte couldn't be in the same room with a fig."
CARRIE	Some people might call that a little odd.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, Samantha was about to get her own special showing."
DOCTOR	Voila.
SAMANTHA	I love it! What else can you do?
CARRIE	"To Samantha, surgery was like being at Barneys. Once you're in the door, you might as well shop."
DOCTOR	We can always lift a little here.
DOCTOR	Take care of these lines.
DOCTOR	Here In five years we can augment the breasts.
DOCTOR	Pick them up a little.
DOCTOR	"In 10 years, tummy tuck."
DOCTOR	Lipo.
DOCTOR	The hip and the thigh area.
NURSE	"Doctor, you're needed on the phone."
DOCTOR	Knee lift.
CARRIE	Samantha felt like she had walked into a fun house.
CARRIE	Only it wasn't particularly funny.
BEN	I'm late for my soccer game.
BEN	Stay here.
BEN	I'll be back in two hours.
CARRIE	It had happened.
CARRIE	We had done it and now I really liked him.
CARRIE	I was deep into the sex haze and completely freaked out.
CARRIE	There had to be something sick and off about him.
CARRIE	"If the rest of the species had devolved, Ben would have to be a freak to survive."
CARRIE	I had to find out what was wrong before I wasted the next six months.
CARRIE	It started innocently enough.
CARRIE	I just wanted to see what the guy ate listened to dated.
CARRIE	Then it took on a life of its own.
CARRIE	"Somewhere in this hip, normal-looking apartment was the clue to Ben 's inner freakiness."
CARRIE	And I wasn 't gonna rest until I found it.
CARRIE	"There it was, taunting me."
CARRIE	Ben 's secret box of freakdom.
CARRIE	"Home of illicit photos, love letters, maybe an old marriage license."
BEN	What the hell are you doing?
CARRIE	I don't know. I can't explain it.
CARRIE	I guess I was looking for something.
BEN	Something?
CARRIE	Something freaky.
BEN	It's my Cub Scout badge collection.
BEN	I was gonna skip the game to be with you.
BEN	I thought you were actually a normal one.
CARRIE	I was.
CARRIE	I'm gonna go.
BEN	Good idea.
CARRIE	That was the day I came face to face with my freak.
CARRIE	The frightening woman whose fear ate her sanity.
CARRIE	"The truth is, it isn't just the men."
CARRIE	It's all of us.
CARRIE	Anyone who's single in Manhattan gets a little freaked out from time to time.
CARRIE	"But we keep trying, because you have to figure if the world's fattest twins can find love, there's hope for all of us."
CARRIE	"Somewhere out there is another little freak who will love us, understand us and kiss our three heads and make it all better."
CARRIE	"And in the meantime, we always have Manhattan."
CARRIE	"In life, certain events come along so rarely that when they do, special attention must be paid."
CARRIE	"Events like Halley's comet, solar eclipses getting that second latte for free."
CARRIE	One night at a salsa club in very downtown Manhattan four single girlfriends found themselves without a relationship at the exact same time.
AN IN CLUB	She's not bad.
CARRIE	Here's to us without men.
IRANDA	"Hear, hear."
CHARLOTTE	I'm not toasting to that.
CHARLOTTE	It's bad luck.
CHARLOTTE	"If I end up old and alone, it's all your fault."
SAMANTHA	"Sweetie, we're all alone, even when we're with men."
CARRIE	"You tell her, Mr."
CARRIE	Sister.
SAMANTHA	"My advice to you, is to embrace that fact slap on some armor and go through life like I do."
SAMANTHA	Enjoying men but not expecting them to fill you up.
SAMANTHA	"Except when, well, you know"
IRANDA	"We know, we know."
WE' WILLIAM	"Excuse me, I was wondering if you'd like to dance."
SAMANTHA	"Thanks, but tonight it's just us girls."
WE' WILLIAM	"I'm William, one of the club owners."
SAMANTHA	Samantha.
WE' WILLIAM	"If you ever feel like a dance, we could have some fun."
IRANDA	"I'm impressed, not dumping us for a guy."
SAMANTHA	Is that the kind of girl you think I am?
CARRIE	I gotta go. I'm getting my picture taken for the magazine article in the morning.
IRANDA	What magazine article? All press needs to be cleared through me.
CARRIE	New York Magazine.
CARRIE	"They're doing a profile of 20 Manhattan singles and it's called ""Single and Fabulous."
SAMANTHA	""" Why wasn't I picked? I'm single and I'm definitely fabulous."
CARRIE	I was picked because Stanford's new boyfriend is the assistant photo editor.
CHARLOTTE	You can't leave.
CHARLOTTE	We never go dancing.
CHARLOTTE	"come on, one more drink."
CARRIE	"All Right, one drink."
SAMANTHA	To hot men.
CARRIE	"One drink turned into many, and before I knew it I was dragging my tired, yet single and fabulous ass home at dawn."
CARRIE	I decided my best bet to avoid looking like I'd been up all night was to stay up all morning.
STANFORD BLATCH	It's Stanford.
STANFORD BLATCH	You're 40 minutes late.
STANFORD BLATCH	I'm at the photo shoot and everyone's freaking out!
CARRIE	"I'm there, 20 minutes."
STANFORD BLATCH	20 minutes!
CARRIE	I said 20 minutes! I could not get a cab.
STANFORD BLATCH	"What did you do, let one drag you here?"
CARRIE	"Stop, I was up all night. I need a coffee the size of my head."
STANFORD BLATCH	"Carrie, this is Nevin."
CARRIE	"Gosh, Hi."
CARRIE	Stanford has told me so much about you.
CARRIE	It's really nice to finally meet you.
EDITOR	"Hello, you're about a fucking month late! Follow me."
STANFORD BLATCH	"Don't look at me, you're the one who's about a fucking month late."
CARRIE	My poncho!
CARRIE	"Hi, I'm so sorry."
LENNOX	Could You sit?
CARRIE	"Sure. There's gonna be time for makeup, right?"
LENNOX	Yeah
STANFORD BLATCH	Thank God!
LENNOX	I wanna do a few test shots before I check the lighting.
CARRIE	Coffee. Do you mind if I smoke?
LENNOX	I don't care if you shoot up.
CARRIE	I never keep people waiting.
CARRIE	I got to bed really late last night.
CARRIE	"And it's my personal belief, I lapsed into a coma."
CARRIE	Thank you.
STANFORD BLATCH	They only had decaf.
CARRIE	Being single and fabulous also frees up one's weekends.
CARRIE	Saturdays usually spent browsing with him in Soho are left for practical things like power walking with your single and fabulous girlfriends.
CHARLOTTE	We're walking too slow.
CARRIE	We're not burning off anything.
CARRIE	Let's gossip to get our heart rates up.
JOSH	Miranda.
IRANDA	"Josh, hi."
IRANDA	How are you?
JOSH	"Good, great. Training for the Marathon."
IRANDA	"Right, I forgot you do that."
JOSH	Five years in a row.
JOSH	"You've got my number, give me a call."
CHARLOTTE	Cute. Who's that?
IRANDA	An ophthalmologist I once faked orgasms with.
CARRIE	We're officially stopping.
CARRIE	The idea that Miranda would fake anything stopped me cold.
IRANDA	I only slept with him twice.
IRANDA	The first time I faked it because it was never gonna happen.
IRANDA	The second time I faked it because I did the first time.
CARRIE	Naturally.
IRANDA	"I didn't wanna fake it again, so I just forgot to return his call."
CHARLOTTE	You broke up with an ophthalmologist over that?
IRANDA	"Orgasm, major thing in a relationship?"
CHARLOTTE	But not the only thing. Orgasms don't send you Valentine's cards and don't hold your hand in a sad movie.
CARRIE	Mine do.
IRANDA	You're seriously advocating faking?
CHARLOTTE	"No, but if you really like the guy, what's one little moment of versus spending the whole night in bed alone?"
IRANDA	These are my options?
CHARLOTTE	Who's to say that one moment is any more important than when he gets up and pours you a cup of coffee in the morning? Let's go!
IRANDA	I'll take an orgasm over a cup of French drip Colombian any day.
CARRIE	"For me, it's a toss-up."
CARRIE	"The usual, please."
CARRIE	"Having smoked all my cigarettes during our workout I stopped for fresh supplies when There I was hanging right next to Martha Stewart Living Carrie Bradshaw, dying of embarrassment."
CARRIE	"""Single and Fabulous?"" There was no question mark implied."
CARRIE	"I would never agree to be in an article, ""Single and Fabulous?"" I was set up."
SAMANTHA	I agree.
SAMANTHA	"You're single, fabulous and fucked."
CARRIE	Not after that picture I won't be.
CARRIE	"They said, ""Single and Fabulous!"" They did not say, ""Single and Fabulous?"" That question mark is hostile."
CHARLOTTE	Miranda Can't we sue them or something?
IRANDA	"for What, mis -punctuation?"
CARRIE	It's too late. I'm all over the city looking like something that got caught in a drain.
CARRIE	You know what? I just quit smoking.
CHARLOTTE	"""Single was fun at 20."
CHARLOTTE	"But you wanna ask these women: ""'How fun will all night club hopping be at 40?""' Who's out all night?"
SAMANTHA	Who's 40?
IRANDA	"Do you know what I say, ""Fuck them, exclamation point!"" Fuck them!"
CHARLOTTE	Fuck them!
CARRIE	"Charlotte said, ""Fuck."
IRANDA	""" Every couple of years, an article like this surfaces as a cautionary tale to scare young women into marriage."
CARRIE	I'm a cautionary tale? Shoot me.
CHARLOTTE	"""Filling their lives with an endless parade of decoys and distractions ""to avoid the painful fact that they're completely alone."
IRANDA	""" How is that helping? This piece of trash has nothing, I repeat, nothing to do with us."
SAMANTHA	"Exactly, we are Single and Fabulous."
IRANDA	Absolutely.
CARRIE	But I had a sneaking suspicion they didn't quite believe it.
CARRIE	"Somehow, the question mark had leapt off my cover and on to each of them."
CARRIE	"Because, within a week Miranda met Josh for old time's sake."
CARRIE	Samantha met William for a dance.
CARRIE	And Charlotte met a deadline head-on.
TOM	"So, I'm moving to Salt Lake City."
CHARLOTTE	What? Why?
TOM	The acting thing in New York is definitely not happening. I've a chance to get on a Christian soap opera if I move out West.
CHARLOTTE	Wow. A Christian soap opera?
TOM	The Days of our Mormon Lives or some shit. Hand me that receiver cable.
TOM	What'll you do around here without me?
CARRIE	"Tom was an out of work actor friend Charlotte had come to depend on to do the occasional male things she needed done around her apartment. Because he was an out of work actor, he had a lot of time."
CARRIE	"And because he had a lot of time, he had a lot of tools."
TOM	Okay.
TOM	That is the VCR.
TOM	"After I rewire your lamp, I'm out of here."
TOM	Unless you have something else you need done.
CARRIE	Charlotte made a decision.
CARRIE	She decided she wasn't gonna let her Mr.
CARRIE	Fix-It get away.
CARRIE	"While women are certainly no strangers to faking it we faked our hair color, cup-size."
CARRIE	"Hell, we've even faked fur."
CARRIE	"I couldn 't help but wonder, has fear of being alone suddenly raised the bar on faking? Are we faking more than orgasms? Are we faking entire relationships? Is it better to fake it than be alone?"
WASPY WOMAN	"My boyfriend and I were really compatible except for one thing: He liked thin, blond, Waspy types."
WASPY WOMAN	So now I am.
AN	I think my wife's an idiot.
AN	Every day with her is like a trip to Idiot Island.
AN	I don't tell her how I really feel.
AN	I'm pretty sure she'd leave me.
WOMAN	I don't understand sign language.
CARRIE	A glamorous city like New York offers a sea of single and fabulous things for the fabulous and single to do.
CARRIE	"As long as the magazine's on newsstands, I'm not going out in public for fear of being scorned and chased with sticks."
CARRIE	"One, one! I'm not smoking."
IRANDA	Look.
IRANDA	"He climbs on top of her, next thing you know, she's coming."
IRANDA	"No wonder they're lost, they've no idea there's more work involved."
CARRIE	Still faking it?
IRANDA	Yep
SAMANTHA	is he That bad in bed?
IRANDA	"No, he's just He's a guy. They can rebuild a jet engine, but when it comes to a woman What's the big mystery? It's my clitoris, not the Sphinx!"
CARRIE	I think you just found the title for your autobiography.
SAMANTHA	It's really not their fault. They don't come with a manual.
SAMANTHA	"If I had a son, I'd teach him all about the vagina."
CARRIE	"If you had a son, we'd call social services."
IRANDA	"The other night, he told me he really likes that I can come while he's fucking me."
IRANDA	How can he believe that that's all it takes?
CARRIE	Because you're faking it!
IRANDA	I'm really hating myself right now.
CARRIE	Could you please just tell me why?
IRANDA	He's a nice guy. He means well.
CARRIE	It's codependent coming.
SAMANTHA	"Well, I have to go."
SAMANTHA	I got a date.
SAMANTHA	"I'm meeting William after work, and then, who knows? From the way he dances, I'm fairly certain I won't have to fake anything."
SAMANTHA	This is a great club.
WE' WILLIAM	Wait until you see my club in the Hamptons.
WE' WILLIAM	Salsa East.
WE' WILLIAM	do You like the Hamptons?
SAMANTHA	"No, love Iove the Hamptons."
WE' WILLIAM	I'm renting a great house in East Hampton. We can go out on the weekends.
WE' WILLIAM	We can go sailing and cook big lobsters. We can walk on the beach
CARRIE	"At first Samantha listened, fascinated, detached."
CARRIE	"It was rare to hear a man use the ""we"" word, so comfortably so early on."
WE' WILLIAM	"Or, we could just lay around and do this."
WE' WILLIAM	Whatever we want.
CARRIE	Pretty soon she gave in.
CARRIE	"She lay back, opened up and let the ""we"" wash over her."
CARRIE	Hello.
SAMANTHA	Guess where I'm spending the summer?
CARRIE	"I don't know, Gucci?"
SAMANTHA	East Hampton. William's renting a house and he's inviting me for the summer.
CARRIE	Isn't it a little early?
SAMANTHA	"honey, no. All the Great places are taken by January."
CARRIE	"I mean, early in the relationship."
SAMANTHA	You should have heard him last night.
SAMANTHA	"""We"" can cook, ""we"" can swim."
CARRIE	"He's a ""we"" guy."
SAMANTHA	"So he's a ""we"" guy, who cares? ""We"" are going to spend the summer in East Hampton."
SAMANTHA	"And the ""we"" I'm referring to right now is you and me."
CARRIE	They say that every great actor knows when to stop performing.
JOSH	I'm getting close.
JOSH	Come with me.
JOSH	Come with me.
CARRIE	"For Miranda, it was that Saturday night at exactly 10:40."
JOSH	"Come with ... oh God, wow."
JOSH	Is everything all right? Are you sure? You didn't come.
JOSH	Did you?
IRANDA	No.
JOSH	"Did I do something wrong tonight, because you came every other time."
JOSH	What? Tell me.
IRANDA	I didn't exactly come all those other times.
JOSH	You faked it? How many of the other times? All of the other times? Do you have a physical problem or something?
IRANDA	Me? What makes you assume it's me?
JOSH	"No offense, it's just Nobody I've ever slept with has had to fake it."
IRANDA	"A lot of women fake it and until five minutes ago you didn't know I was faking it, so"
JOSH	What are you saying? All the women I've slept with have been faking it?
IRANDA	What are you looking at?
JOSH	"Nothing, I was just running a list in my head."
IRANDA	"Look, Josh."
IRANDA	A woman's anatomy is a little more complicated I know all about a woman's anatomy.
JOSH	I'm a doctor.
IRANDA	You're an eye doctor.
JOSH	Give me some tips.
IRANDA	Pardon me?
JOSH	Tips to get You off.
JOSH	I am nobody's charity case. I run the Marathon for Christ's sake.
IRANDA	Do you know how the clitoris works?
JOSH	Yes.
IRANDA	do You know where It is?
JOSH	Yes.
IRANDA	It's about two inches from where you think it is.
JOSH	my god.
IRANDA	"Relax, I'll show you."
CARRIE	"Later that week, I went over to Charlotte's to see some of Tom's handiwork."
CHARLOTTE	"After we finish with the lighting, we'll move to the kitchen."
CHARLOTTE	We're retiling everything.
CARRIE	"First Samantha and now Charlotte went ""we,"" ""we,"" all about her home."
CARRIE	That's amazing! How will you get all that done before you leave?
TOM	I'm not leaving. I've decided to stay.
TOM	I have to go to my place and get a voltmeter.
CHARLOTTE	Okay.
TOM	"I'll be right back, okay?"
CHARLOTTE	"Bye, honey."
CARRIE	"""Bye, honey?"""
CHARLOTTE	"When he told me he was leaving, I suddenly had feelings what if he was the one? He'd been under my nose the entire time and I'd never even seen him."
CHARLOTTE	"I let the ""almost-40-out-of-work-actor"" thing get in the way."
CHARLOTTE	He is strong and masculine and he can fix things around the house.
CARRIE	You can't create a relationship with a guy just because he can caulk your tub.
CHARLOTTE	"Yes, you can."
CARRIE	"As I walked home, I couldn't help but wonder when did being alone become the modern day equivalent of being a leper? Will Manhattan restaurants soon be divided up into sections? Smoking, non-smoking, single, non-single?"
CARRIE	"The usual, please. Then I had a frightening thought."
CARRIE	Maybe I was the one who was faking it.
CARRIE	All these years faking to myself that I was happy being single.
CARRIE	"Yes, it's me."
CARRIE	"And there it was, pity."
CARRIE	Pity from the man who sells me my Marlboro Lights.
CARRIE	It was the final straw.
CARRIE	"I decided I wasn 't gonna let a magazine or my friends or the Surgeon General stop me from being who I was: Single and fabulous, exclamation point."
WAITER	Tartini?
CARRIE	Excuse me?
STANFORD BLATCH	Tartini: Cranberry flavored vodka.
CARRIE	I've been out of commission for four days and there's a new drink? I invited Stanford to join me at a fabulous party downtown to honor the fabulous conceptual photographer Ellen von Unwerth.
CARRIE	"Unfortunately, he invited his new boyfriend, Nevin ""von Bitchy."
CARRIE	""" Hi, I hate you."
EDITOR	"join the club, I hate me, too."
EDITOR	I'm so sorry about the cover.
EDITOR	I had nothing to do with it.
CARRIE	Who cares? Next week you'll have a coke-dealing slumlord on the cover.
EDITOR	You are fabulous.
EDITOR	Excuse me.
CARRIE	You realize you'll have to dump him.
STANFORD BLATCH	I can't.
STANFORD BLATCH	We're getting a summer share in Sagaponack.
CARRIE	Tartini! While Stanford and I did downtown Samantha was uptown waiting for William at her favorite romantic restaurant.
BUSBOY	Alone?
SAMANTHA	"No, I'm waiting for someone."
CARRIE	At first she thought she had the wrong time.
CARRIE	When he still wasn't there No message.
SAMANTHA	I don't know what's keeping him.
SAMANTHA	Could you ask the waiter to bring me a red wine?
CARRIE	"She hadn't expected to be caught out in public alone without a book, project, or any of her ""dining-out-alone-armor."" She had nothing to do but sit and wait for him."
CARRIE	"By now she knew that ""we"" William wasn 't ever gonna show up."
CARRIE	He was one of those men who faked a future to get what he wanted in the present.
BUSBOY	More water?
SAMANTHA	No. No more water.
CARRIE	"She felt exposed, vulnerable, like a fool."
SAMANTHA	"My God, people are looking."
SAMANTHA	I'm so embarrassed.
BUSBOY	It's okay.
SAMANTHA	Where's the ladies' room? -
BUSBOY	This way.
SAMANTHA	Show me the way.
BUSBOY	You okay?
SAMANTHA	Thank you. You're very sweet.
SAMANTHA	I'm not usually like this.
SAMANTHA	I can't believe I fell for some guy's line.
SAMANTHA	"But sometimes you just need to hear ""we."" You know?"
CARRIE	Samantha let the Pakistani busboy kiss her.
CARRIE	"After all, he'd been so sweet and attentive with the bread."
BUSBOY	"You take me home, you're not alone."
CARRIE	"As Samantha looked into his sweet and hopeful eyes, she realized something."
CARRIE	No matter how much it hurts sometimes it's better to be alone than fake it.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, downtown, I heard the funniest thing I'd ever heard from a man I just met."
CARRIE	My God.
CARRIE	"I'm sorry, your pants."
CARRIE	I'm sorry.
	It's fine.
CARRIE	"Well, fuck you."
CARRIE	Exclamation point.
STANFORD BLATCH	"Okay, you little Tartini."
STANFORD BLATCH	Time to go home.
STANFORD BLATCH	You've had enough.
CARRIE	"C'mon, it's early."
STANFORD BLATCH	It's 2:00 a.
STANFORD BLATCH	m.
STANFORD BLATCH	On a Tuesday.
CARRIE	Just go.
CARRIE	"Go, go, go home."
CARRIE	"Take your tired, fabulous ass home."
CARRIE	I want to meet cute guys.
STANFORD BLATCH	"Everyone here is gay, gay, gay."
CARRIE	I don't think so.
JAKE	Need a light?
CARRIE	His name was Jake. He was everything I was looking for that night.
CARRIE	"Single, straight and a smoker."
CARRIE	There wasn't quite as much smoke uptown.
JOSH	How's that? Is that better now? How about now?
CARRIE	Miranda's two-day tutorial with her ophthalmologist had turned lovemaking into a kind of naked eye exam.
IRANDA	Maybe we should just try and let it happen for a second.
JOSH	I wanna do it right.
JOSH	How's that?
CARRIE	"Even with all Josh's good intentions, Miranda found herself no closer. She realized she was not a jet engine."
CARRIE	She was a lot more complicated.
CARRIE	It would never work between them.
JOSH	"I'm close, are you close? I'm close."
CARRIE	She wanted to give him something for learning so much and trying so hard.
CARRIE	"So, Miranda came."
CARRIE	She came out of retirement for one final performance.
JOSH	I'm the man.
JAKE	Wanna Go for a ride in my Porsche?
CARRIE	Fabulous.
JAKE	I need some smokes.
JAKE	Do you want anything? I'll be right back.
JAKE	How you doing? I want a pack of Marlboro Lights.
CARRIE	I looked at myself in the mirror.
CARRIE	"What had I been so afraid of all week? I was still young, still desirable."
CARRIE	I would never wind up alone.
JAKE	Is this you?
CARRIE	And there it was. My question mark staring me right in the face.
CARRIE	"Was that me? If I went home with him, it'd be the only time I'd ever had sex to validate my life."
CARRIE	"The question mark would no longer be a question, it would be a fact."
CARRIE	I gotta Go home.
JAKE	"No way, I'm not letting you out."
CARRIE	Fine.
TOM	I think I should go to Salt Lake City.
TOM	Give it a try.
CHARLOTTE	"Oh no, really?"
CARRIE	"Charlotte was faking it. She'd realized two days ago, while she had no problem faking orgasms she could never fake intimacy."
TOM	My heart's still in acting.
TOM	I'm not ready to let it go.
CARRIE	"Tom was faking, too."
CARRIE	He was mostly just sick of New York and needed an excuse to leave.
CHARLOTTE	I'll miss you.
TOM	"I'll miss you, too."
CARRIE	It was a perfectly timed double fake.
CARRIE	"Under other circumstances, they could've shared a long life together."
CARRIE	"Over the next week, things returned to normal."
JOSH	"Miranda, babe, it's Josh."
JOSH	I'm home.
JOSH	Give me a call.
CARRIE	Miranda forgot to return Josh 's last call.
CARRIE	"Samantha made peace with her feelings about ""we"" William."
CARRIE	And Charlotte learned you don 't have to rely on men 's affections to get things fixed around the house.
CARRIE	You can pay them.
CARRIE	"As for me, after I was recycled I decided instead of running away from the idea of a life alone I'd better sit down and take that fear to lunch."
SERVER	Waiting for someone?
CARRIE	"No, it's just me."
CARRIE	Thanks.
CARRIE	"So, I sat there and had a glass of wine alone."
CARRIE	"No books, no man, no friends, no armor no faking."
CARRIE	There are only two times when it's appropriate to wear the little black dress in daylight.
CARRIE	One involves leaving a party way too late.
CARRIE	The other involves leaving the party way too early.
CARRIE	The New York funeral.
CARRIE	Javier was a hot Cuban designer and the toast of the New York fashion elite.
CARRIE	He was also a good friend.
CARRIE	I had known him since he was Harvey.
CARRIE	Javier loved clothes.
CARRIE	"Unfortunately, he loved heroin more."
CARRIE	Shit.
CARRIE	Okay.
CARRIE	"Wow, look at you!"
SAMANTHA	You like?
CARRIE	Isn't it a little wrong to wear a dead man's design to his own funeral?
SAMANTHA	It's wrong not to.
SAMANTHA	"Besides, at $2,000, I better get some wear out of it."
CARRIE	"$2,000? You're kidding."
SAMANTHA	Marked up 30 percent since yesterday.
CARRIE	That's the thing about New York.
CARRIE	You're always more popular when your not around.
SAMANTHA	I have to look fabulous.
SAMANTHA	Everyone is gonna be there.
CARRIE	"Reminder, honey: This is a funeral, not Friday night at Bond Street."
SAMANTHA	That's your grief talking.
SAMANTHA	"Get your purse, let's go."
CHARLOTTE	Sorry I'm late.
SAMANTHA	is everyone in town invited to this?
CHARLOTTE	Carrie invited me.
SAMANTHA	You got invited with a guest?
CARRIE	We were supposed to see a show together.
CHARLOTTE	That dress is really inappropriate.
CARRIE	"Apparently, Charlotte and I were the inappropriate ones."
CARRIE	"There it was, Javier's entire new spring line."
CARRIE	It was his best show ever.
CHARLOTTE	Everyone's wearing a Javier.
SAMANTHA	Told you.
CHARLOTTE	"Lend me your hat, please?"
SAMANTHA	"Fine. But if anyone asks, it was a gift from the designer."
CARRIE	"Christ, my heels keep getting stuck."
CARRIE	So much for death with dignity.
JOSEPHINA	Hello.
JOSEPHINA	Buenos dias.
SAMANTHA	Look at the number they did on Josephina.
CHARLOTTE	She is beautiful.
SAMANTHA	She wasn't a week ago.
CARRIE	Josephina was Javier's sister and heir apparent to the Javier industry.
CARRIE	In a day she had gone from ugly duckling to Donatella Versace.
CARRIE	Death definitely became her.
CHARLOTTE	You're smoking at a funeral?
CARRIE	Javier would have wanted it that way.
JOSEPHINA	We are asking today that in Javier's memory all donations be made to Javier House a home we are building to house those in the fashion industry who suffer from substance abuse.
CARRIE	"No, don't."
SAMANTHA	No?
CARRIE	no.
SAMANTHA	I'm gonna help them raise money.
CARRIE	That's unusually nice of you.
SAMANTHA	"Forget nice, the mailing list will be priceless."
SAMANTHA	And I'll have every unlisted 212 number in Manhattan.
CARRIE	You had to give Samantha credit.
CARRIE	She always saw the positive.
CARRIE	One man's death was another woman 's p.r. opportunity
SAMANTHA	"Josephina, I'm Samantha Jones from Samantha Jones Public Relations."
SAMANTHA	"I was so touched by your speech, that I wanted to"
CHARLOTTE	I'm sorry.
NED	It's nothing to lose your hat over.
NED	She loved hats.
NED	It's fitting really.
CHARLOTTE	Your mother?
NED	My wife.
CHARLOTTE	I'm so sorry.
NED	It's okay.
NED	Thanks.
CHARLOTTE	Kids?
NED	Nope.
CHARLOTTE	It's just a drink.
CHARLOTTE	He works on the same block as my gallery.
CARRIE	You picked up a man at a cemetery?
CHARLOTTE	He's handsome and he went to Princeton.
SAMANTHA	the widower thing is a definite No -no.
CHARLOTTE	Why?
CARRIE	The dead wife factor.
SAMANTHA	"No matter how bitchy she was alive, now she's dead and you're the bitch who can't live up to her."
CHARLOTTE	Don't talk about his wife like that.
SAMANTHA	See? Happening already.
CHARLOTTE	It's not his fault she died.
CHARLOTTE	"And besides, going through something like that makes him more sensitive."
CHARLOTTE	He's felt really deeply.
CHARLOTTE	He's in touch with his emotions.
CHARLOTTE	It's kind of romantic.
CHARLOTTE	Think about it.
CHARLOTTE	He's been married.
CHARLOTTE	It shows he can commit.
SAMANTHA	Then date a divorced guy.
SAMANTHA	They've committed and everyone's still alive.
CARRIE	It didn't work for Big.
CARRIE	All marriage did was convince him he hated committing.
CHARLOTTE	You broke up with him.
CARRIE	So I'm the one with the commitment problem?
CHARLOTTE	I'm just saying
CARRIE	While we were watching them break ground on Javier's last location Miranda was breaking new ground of her own.
REALTOR	"So, it's just you?"
IRANDA	Yep. Just me.
REALTOR	Such a big apartment to buy for just you.
IRANDA	I have a lot of shoes.
REALTOR	Maybe the boyfriend will move in?
IRANDA	No boyfriend. Just me.
REALTOR	I have a son who owns his own business.
IRANDA	"No, thanks."
IRANDA	I'll take it.
CARRIE	"With that, Ms."
CARRIE	"Miranda Hobbes Esquire, a.k.a."
CARRIE	"""just me"" bought herself her first apartment and promptly took herself out for a drink."
CARRIE	While Miranda was out celebrating her future I was in contemplating my own.
CARRIE	"In a city that moves so fast, you get the Sunday paper on Saturday how did any of us know how much time we had left? There was so much I hadn't done."
CARRIE	I'd never been to Greece.
CARRIE	I hadn't finished painting my bathroom My Visa bill still wasn't paid in full.
CARRIE	"Hell, sometimes I felt like I was barely living."
BIG	Hello.
CARRIE	Hey.
BIG	Hey.
CARRIE	It's just me.
BIG	"So, how are you?"
CARRIE	Just got back from a funeral.
BIG	And you thought of me? I'm flattered.
CARRIE	Listen do you want to have dinner some time?
BIG	I'd like to have dinner any old time. Who am I having dinner with?
CARRIE	Me.
BIG	"In that case, I better check my book."
CARRIE	I'm hanging up now.
BIG	Fine.
BIG	"Saturday, 8:00, Roberto's."
BIG	Be there or be square.
CARRIE	"God, you're old."
CARRIE	It was so easy.
CARRIE	"Just like that, I had made a Saturday night date with Big."
CARRIE	"In under 30 seconds, we had resuscitated a relationship that had taken six months to die."
CARRIE	"The next day, Samantha set out to break some records of her own."
RICHARD 'DICK' CRANWELL	"You know, I rarely make personal contributions."
SAMANTHA	We'd love to have you on the Javier House board.
SAMANTHA	Maybe in this case you can make an exception?
RICHARD 'DICK' CRANWELL	I'll tell you what's exceptional. Getting solicited by a woman as beautiful as you.
CARRIE	"Richard Cranwell, senior partner at Bear Sterns philanthropist, playboy."
CARRIE	His specialty was hostile takeovers.
SAMANTHA	"Flattery will get you everywhere, Mr."
SAMANTHA	Cranwell.
RICHARD 'DICK' CRANWELL	"Please, call me Dick."
SAMANTHA	Dick.
CARRIE	"In Samantha's case, it was more like a friendly merger."
RICHARD 'DICK' CRANWELL	Perhaps we could discuss Javier House over dinner sometime.
SAMANTHA	I believe that could be arranged.
CARRIE	Samantha groped Dick Cranwell for the good of all strung-out designers everywhere.
CARRIE	"Unfortunately, she was not expecting Sandy Cranwell back early from groping a sweater set at Bendels."
SANDY CRANWELL	Get out.
SAMANTHA	I'll just leave the proposal.
CARRIE	"Apparently, Sandy was not feeling as charitable as her husband."
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, at her mortgage company across town Miranda was having her own troubles closing the deal."
ORTGAGE GUY	"So, it's just you."
IRANDA	"Yeah, just me."
ORTGAGE GUY	"Check the ""single woman"" box."
ORTGAGE GUY	Initial.
ORTGAGE GUY	And the down payment's coming from your father?
IRANDA	No. Just me.
ORTGAGE GUY	"Check the ""single woman"" box."
CARRIE	In the course of one hour Miranda had checked more single women 's boxes than her gynecologist.
IRANDA	"I'm telling you, if I was a single man, none of this would be happening."
CARRIE	"If you were a single man, I'd date you."
IRANDA	"I've got the money, I've got a great job, and I still get, ""it's just you?"""
CARRIE	They're threatened.
CARRIE	Buying a place alone means you don't need a man.
IRANDA	I don't.
CHARLOTTE	Everyone needs a man.
CHARLOTTE	That's why I rent.
CHARLOTTE	"If you own and he still rents, then the power structure is all off."
CHARLOTTE	It's emasculating.
CHARLOTTE	Men don't want a woman who's too self-sufficient.
SAMANTHA	"I'm sorry, did someone just order a Victorian straight up?"
AITRE D'	"I'm sorry, Miss Jones, your card's not accepted."
SAMANTHA	That's not possible.
SAMANTHA	Try it again.
AITRE D'	Maybe I'm not making myself clear.
AITRE D'	Your card and you are not accepted here.
CARRIE	Samantha had messed with the wrong woman.
CARRIE	Sandy Cranwell practically owned Manhattan and wanted Samantha off it.
SAMANTHA	"Come on, let's go."
CARRIE	Sandy Cranwell had done what any well-heeled socialite would do.
CARRIE	She took out a social hit on Samantha.
CARRIE	"In 12 hours, Sam had gone from ""a"" list to blacklist."
CARRIE	"The next night, Charlotte met Ned the widower for drinks."
NED	This was fun.
NED	Maybe we could meet for a real meal next time.
CHARLOTTE	I'd like that.
CARRIE	"They talked about architecture, art, the Ivy League."
CARRIE	The ex-wife wasn 't even in the picture Is this her? until the ex-wife's picture showed up.
NED	Yeah.
CHARLOTTE	She's so pretty.
NED	"Let's get out of here, okay?"
CHARLOTTE	I'm sorry. That was really thoughtless of me.
CHARLOTTE	I know this must be hard for you.
NED	It's just a little weird talking about her on a date.
CHARLOTTE	I understand.
CHARLOTTE	It's a beautiful night.
CHARLOTTE	Are you okay?
NED	"I'm sorry. It's just Seeing Liz's picture and thinking about her Oh, God! I'm sorry."
CHARLOTTE	Here.
CARRIE	"Ordinarily, Charlotte hated when men cried."
CARRIE	"But on Ned, it only made him more romantic."
NED	Wow.
NED	So embarrassing.
NED	I'm just feeling so much right now.
CARRIE	Those were magic words to Charlotte's ears.
CHARLOTTE	It's okay.
CHARLOTTE	You just take as much time as you need.
CHARLOTTE	Okay? It's okay.
CARRIE	"Apparently, all the time Ned needed was 45 minutes."
CHARLOTTE	"That night, under the watchful eyes of a dead woman Ned came back to life twice."
IRANDA	One word: Rebound.
CHARLOTTE	Not when the other person's dead.
CARRIE	She has a point.
CHARLOTTE	He's moving on.
CHARLOTTE	I'm helping him to get over his wife.
IRANDA	"This guy has ""project"" written all over him."
CHARLOTTE	That's not fair.
CARRIE	So how was the sex?
CHARLOTTE	"Amazing. It was like Liz was looking over us, giving us her blessing."
CARRIE	A threesome in absentia.
CHARLOTTE	"I mean, my hat blew right into her headstone."
CHARLOTTE	She was clearly sending a message.
IRANDA	"Yeah, ""don't fuck my husband, you hat-Ioving bitch."
CHARLOTTE	""" He invited me to a memorial service at her grave next week."
CHARLOTTE	That is huge.
CARRIE	"Excuse me, but when did cemeteries get so happening?"
CHARLOTTE	It's a sign that he's ready to move on.And he's ready to do it with me.
IRANDA	You're saying you fucked him back to life?
CHARLOTTE	"In a way, yes."
CARRIE	"Man, you're good."
CARRIE	That night I had my date with Big.
CARRIE	"I was feeling everything fear, happiness, dread."
CARRIE	Was I ready to jump back into a life with Big in it? Was seeing him again a huge mistake? And if it was why was I so excited? I had never felt so confused.
CARRIE	Was Charlotte right? In a world where everyone's dying to make a connection can a relationship bring you back to life?
BIG	I never really thought about it.
CARRIE	"Come on, everybody wonders what happens after you die."
BIG	I'm too busy wondering who's dinging my car in the garage.
CARRIE	I think we reincarnate.
BIG	That's the easy way out.
BIG	What are you gonna come back as?
CARRIE	Someone who knows better.
BIG	You smell nice.
CARRIE	I'm serious.
CARRIE	do You believe in heaven?
BIG	Yeah.
CARRIE	Really? What's your idea of heaven?
BIG	"A big bed. And they're just saying, ""Come on in."
CARRIE	""" You're idea of heaven is a bed?"
BIG	It depends on who's in it.
CARRIE	I'm not sleeping with you tonight.
BIG	I thought we were just having dinner.
CARRIE	We are.
CARRIE	"A half hour later, and I was back at Big's, the site of so many past little deaths."
CARRIE	It felt great and weird and wrong.
CARRIE	We can't do this.
BIG	"Yes, we can."
CARRIE	Not like this.
BIG	"You're right, let's go inside."
CARRIE	No.
CARRIE	I have to go.
CARRIE	"I didn 't know what had happened but suddenly, getting back together with Big seemed like a very bad idea."
CARRIE	I was scared to death.
CARRIE	"The first time we got involved, I got out just in time."
CARRIE	"Would I be as lucky the second? Across town, Samantha was facing her own uncertain future."
SAMANTHA	Check It again: Samantha Jones.
BOUNCER	Sorry.
CARRIE	"The first time, she thought it was an unfortunate oversight."
CARRIE	The second time was just unfortunate.
HOSTESS	"I'm sorry, we're all full."
SAMANTHA	I'll wait for a table.
HOSTESS	Don't bother.
CARRIE	"By the third time she was turned away, it had all become clear."
CARRIE	She was deader in this town than Javier.
ASSISTANT	"Teddy, take her out of here."
CARRIE	"The next day, Miranda met her new neighbor."
OLDER WOMAN	Hello! Are you my new neighbor?
IRANDA	"Yeah. Hi, I'm Miranda Hobbes."
IRANDA	Nice to meet you.
IRANDA	I haven't actually moved in yet.
IRANDA	I'm just taking some measurements.
OLDER WOMAN	I'm so glad to have a young person moving in.
OLDER WOMAN	Brings a little life to the place.
OLDER WOMAN	Ruthie kept pretty much to herself.
OLDER WOMAN	Never married.
OLDER WOMAN	"She died in there, you know."
IRANDA	She did?
OLDER WOMAN	"Oh, yes. It was a week before anyone realized she passed."
OLDER WOMAN	"Rumor has it, the cat ate half her face. So, just you?"
CARRIE	"That night, Miranda had another disconcerting experience."
CARRIE	Halfway through her Three Delicacy Delight a delicacy got stuck.
CARRIE	After Miranda was done saving her own life she called someone who could commiserate.
CARRIE	"Unfortunately, I was deep into screening mode."
CARRIE	Big had called twice and I didn't know what I wanted to say to him.
IRANDA	"Oh my God, I just choked! I just almost died and you are not"
CARRIE	"Hey, sweetie, you all right?"
IRANDA	"I was watching Hard Copy, and I kept thinking when they found me I would forever be the dead girl who watched bad TV."
CARRIE	Why didn't you call me?
IRANDA	"I couldn't breathe. I'm gonna die alone, Carrie."
CARRIE	"No, you are not."
CARRIE	Do you want me to come over?
IRANDA	"No, I'm okay. I'll call you tomorrow."
CARRIE	"The fact was, Miranda was not okay."
CARRIE	She went to bed hungry and locked the cat in the kitchen for two days.
CARRIE	"After a week of being a social pariah Samantha realized if she ever wanted to get her life back, she'd have to beg for it."
CARRIE	"She went to the top, the Godfather."
SHIPPY SHIPMAN	Samantha Jones.
SHIPPY SHIPMAN	The name sounds familiar.
CARRIE	Shippy Shipman was the queen of the ladies who lunch.
CARRIE	And was personally responsible for the demise of at least 70 social lives.
SAMANTHA	You might know me from the Javier House Foundation?
SHIPPY SHIPMAN	"No, that's not it."
SAMANTHA	No?
SHIPPY SHIPMAN	I believe you were the whore who once groped my husband at a Whitney benefit.
CARRIE	It was bad.
CARRIE	Not only was Samantha dying but her entire sex life was flashing before her.
SAMANTHA	Maybe.
SAMANTHA	I don't really remember.
SHIPPY SHIPMAN	I do.
SAMANTHA	You're good friends with Sandy Cranwell?
SHIPPY SHIPMAN	"Yes, we go back to Chapin."
SAMANTHA	Could you maybe talk to her for me?
SHIPPY SHIPMAN	"I think you made your own bed and you need to lie in it. And you're good at that, aren't you, Samantha?"
SAMANTHA	"What do you want me to say, Shippy? That I'm a whore? That I've slept with every man in New York and some in Brooklyn? All right, maybe I have."
SAMANTHA	"Is that what it's gonna take? Okay, I'm a big whore. Now, will you help me?"
SHIPPY SHIPMAN	I don't think so.
SAMANTHA	Fine.
SAMANTHA	And I only groped your husband's flat preppy ass at that benefit because I was drunk.
SAMANTHA	I'll see myself out.
CARRIE	"The next day, Miranda decided to check out her new neighborhood."
CARRIE	"But suddenly, she was the one checking out."
CARRIE	That was the peculiar thing about New York you never knew if a cab was going to save you or kill you
IRANDA	"Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, please."
CARRIE	or both.
IRANDA	That was freaky.
IRANDA	I felt like I was drowning and dying at the same time.
CARRIE	They said you had a panic attack.
IRANDA	"Yeah, and I had to pay $500 of my single person's salary to find that out."
CARRIE	What's wrong?
IRANDA	"Take a good look at my face, because at my funeral there'll only be half of it. I'll be dead and my cat will be happy."
IRANDA	Charlotte will be picking up men at the next grave site over.
CARRIE	"Breathe, sweetie, breathe."
IRANDA	"I'm all alone, Carrie."
IRANDA	"The first people on my ""call in case of emergency"" list are my parents."
IRANDA	And I don't like them.
IRANDA	And they live in Pennsylvania.
CARRIE	"Sweetie, you can put me on there."
IRANDA	I can't! You screen!
CARRIE	I'll pick up. I promise.
CARRIE	"Listen you did the right thing buying that apartment. You love it, right?"
IRANDA	Yeah.
CARRIE	And you won't be alone forever.
CARRIE	"The truth was, I didn't know if any of us would end up alone."
CARRIE	But I did know Miranda couldn't afford another panic attack.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, over in Queens Charlotte was about to get a surprise of her own."
NED	You brought lilies.
CHARLOTTE	You said they were her favorite.
CHARLOTTE	Please tell me those are your sisters.
NED	I don't have any sisters.
CARRIE	Charlotte realized she wasn't the only woman resuscitating Ned.
CARRIE	Charlotte's relationship died right where it started.
CARRIE	She was prepared to live in the shadow of a dead woman.
CARRIE	She wasn 't prepared to live in the shadow of three live ones.
CARRIE	"That Saturday, Samantha hit rock bottom also known as Javier House."
CARRIE	No one would return her phone calls.
CARRIE	She hadn 't raised any money.
CARRIE	All she could do for Javier House was construct it.
CARRIE	"But six hours of hard labor later, Samantha experienced her own rebirth."
CARRIE	"It was Leonardo DiCaprio, ex machina."
CARRIE	"That day, Leonardo and Samantha became fast friends."
CARRIE	The nightmare was over.
CARRIE	Leonardo DiCaprio had brought Sam back to social life.
CARRIE	To add insult to panic attack Miranda had just gotten some unsettling news.
CARRIE	The mortgage officer had messed up Miranda's application.
CARRIE	"They had inadvertently labeled her as ""separated."
CARRIE	""" And to clear up the confusion Miranda had to write a rather humiliating letter."
CARRIE	Miranda had a choice.
CARRIE	She could panic or she could just type.
CARRIE	Miranda killed her panic attacks right then and there.
CARRIE	She realized she probably wouldn't die alone.
CARRIE	But she kept overfeeding her cat just in case.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, four unreturned calls later, my number was up."
BIG	"Good, you're alive."
CARRIE	"Wait, where are you going?"
BIG	Home. I'm old.
BIG	It's past my bedtime.
CARRIE	I'm sorry.
BIG	You should be.
BIG	I had box seats to a Yankee double header.
CARRIE	Damn! Who'd you take?
BIG	Someone who returned my calls.
CARRIE	"It was deja vu all over again: Me, Big, a doorway and mixed emotions."
CARRIE	"Wait, not here."
BIG	"Don't do this, Carrie."
CARRIE	Come on.
CARRIE	We're going out.
CARRIE	I took him to the most non-sexual place I could think of.
CARRIE	I'm good! Did you see that?
BIG	"Wow, I sure did."
CARRIE	"Two pitchers of cheap beer later, Big and I were having a great time."
BIG	You know what my version of hell is? Wearing rented two-tone shoes.
CARRIE	"Hey, batter batter!"
BIG	No heckling the bowler. Did you see that?
CARRIE	Yeah. That was nice.
BIG	Look at that.
BIG	I won.
CARRIE	"Okay, two out of three."
BIG	You want to play a second game?
CARRIE	Maybe.
BIG	Are you sure you're ready to get killed all over again?
CARRIE	"I didn't know what we were talking about anymore. But either way, I knew the answer."
CARRIE	"Yep, let's do it."
CARRIE	We never made it to the second game.
CARRIE	I didn't know if it was suicide or not.
CARRIE	All I knew was Big and I had been reincarnated and I'd never felt more alive.
CARRIE	They say that New Yorkers will attend the opening of an envelope as long as the champagne doesn't run dry.
CARRIE	"But tonight's opening at Charlotte's gallery for Yael a lesbian painter from Brooklyn Heights actually transcended the bad wine, stale cheese routine."
CARRIE	It was lesbian chic meets art-world cool.
CARRIE	A surprisingly fabulous combustion that no one saw coming.
CARRIE	"Charlotte was there with her latest fling, Gareth Davis."
CARRIE	"A toxic bachelor and the owner of Thorn, a downtown restaurant frequented by second-tier models and the men who buy them salad."
CARRIE	Miranda brought Ethan Watson a documentary filmmaker she had met the week before at a sparsely attended Harvard Alumni mixer.
CARRIE	And my date for the evening was Samantha.
CARRIE	Not entirely inappropriate given the circumstances.
CARRIE	Here.
SAMANTHA	Nobody told me it was B.Y.O.Man
CARRIE	What did you expect? It's a lesbian art show.
SAMANTHA	But don't straight guys follow them around to see what they're going to do? Wait a second.
SAMANTHA	You see that guy?
CARRIE	Who?
SAMANTHA	I know him.
CARRIE	who is he?
SAMANTHA	He's a trainer at my gym. And you should see his squat thrusts.
SAMANTHA	I'm just gonna say hello.
CARRIE	"You know what, honey? I think I'm gonna go home."
SAMANTHA	"Relax, I'll be right back."
CARRIE	I don't feel very well.
SAMANTHA	What's wrong?
CARRIE	I have a headache. It Just hit me.
SAMANTHA	You want a Percodan? I'm fine.
CARRIE	I just need some sleep.
CARRIE	"Go on, make new friends."
SAMANTHA	I'll call you.
CARRIE	Okay.
CARRIE	"With Samantha, Miranda and Charlotte all suitably occupied I figured there was no better time to make my escape."
CARRIE	"The truth was, I had another engagement."
CARRIE	But I didn't dare tell any of my friends where I was going or who I was planning to meet.
BIG	Wow. You look sensational.
CARRIE	You don't look so bad yourself.
BIG	This old thing? I've had it for years.
CARRIE	I knew it was wrong.
CARRIE	Seeing an emotionally unavailable man I had sworn off months earlier.
CARRIE	But the guilt worked like an aphrodisiac.
CARRIE	I had never felt sexier or more alive in my entire life.
CARRIE	"By midnight, Charlotte discovered Manhattan 's latest group to flaunt their disposable income: The power lesbian."
CARRIE	They seem to have everything.
CARRIE	"Great shoes, killer eyewear and the secrets to invisible makeup."
LYDIA	I want That one.
LYDIA	I'm gonna take it.
EILEEN	Didn't I say I was buying it?
LYDIA	I thought You were taking the large one.
EILEEN	I want both.
LYDIA	For God's sakes.
CARRIE	Charlotte had never sold out a show before in her life.
CARRIE	She was pleasantly surprised.
CARRIE	"Unfortunately, there was a not so pleasant surprise in store for her."
GALLERY ATTENDANT	We're out of champagne.
CHARLOTTE	I'm sure I have an extra case or two in the back storeroom.
CHARLOTTE	Excuse me.
GARETH DAVIS	"Relax, we're just kissing."
GARETH DAVIS	I'll see you in there.
CHARLOTTE	I can't believe he had the nerve to kiss her and still pretend he wasn't cheating.
CARRIE	Maybe he doesn't consider kissing cheating.
SAMANTHA	Come on.
SAMANTHA	It was only your second date.
CHARLOTTE	So? Doesn't that guarantee me fidelity until the end of the evening?
IRANDA	"Remember Ron, the married guy with kids on Park Avenue? He didn't consider fucking below 23rd Street cheating."
CHARLOTTE	That's insane.
SAMANTHA	Men cheat for the same reason that dogs lick their balls: Because they can.
SAMANTHA	It's part of their biology.
SAMANTHA	Instead of wasting all this energy condemning it maybe it's time we all got in line with the reality of the situation.
CARRIE	"That sounds very empowering, but you're forgetting one detail."
IRANDA	I hope so.
CARRIE	Women cheat.
CHARLOTTE	But it's completely different.
SAMANTHA	How?
CHARLOTTE	We don't go around randomly attacking any man we're attracted to.
SAMANTHA	Speak for yourself.
CHARLOTTE	We're not driven by testosterone.
CARRIE	Then what does drive us according to you?
CHARLOTTE	Emotions.
SAMANTHA	You mean hormones.
CHARLOTTE	No.
CHARLOTTE	"I mean that little voice inside of me that says, ""Mate for life."
SAMANTHA	""" You can't listen to every fucking little voice that runs through your head."
SAMANTHA	It'll drive you nuts.
CARRIE	The problem is that you two have very different definitions of cheating.
CHARLOTTE	I don't tolerate it.
SAMANTHA	And I'm more forgiving and realistic about human nature.
IRANDA	That's because you cheat.
CARRIE	I just don't think that you can define cheating in absolute terms.
CHARLOTTE	You think it's okay to cheat?
CARRIE	I think maybe there's a cheating curve. Someone's definition of what constitutes cheating is in direct proportion to how much they themselves want to cheat.
IRANDA	That's moral relativism.
CARRIE	I prefer to think of it as quantum cheating.
SAMANTHA	"The fact is, the act of cheating is defined by the act of getting caught."
SAMANTHA	One doesn't exist without the other.
CARRIE	"I wondered, was Samantha right? Is cheating like the proverbial tree in the forest? That it doesn't exist if there's no one around to catch you? In a gravity-free world of anything goes, what constitutes cheating?"
THOR	Everybody cheats. That's the great thing about having a trainer.
THOR	"Seven, keep your neck back."
THOR	Eight.
THOR	Pisses me off seeing people train improperly.
SAMANTHA	I guess I better behave then.
THOR	I'm all about form and discipline.
THOR	Do it right or don't bother doing it at all.
SAMANTHA	Yes.
CARRIE	Samantha realized that while purity of form exacted a price it also had its own rewards.
THOR	So how do you feel?
SAMANTHA	You got me all wet. I mean sweaty.
THOR	Same time on Wednesday?
SAMANTHA	It's a date
CARRIE	"Later that day, Charlotte realized she was tired of listening to another man 's weak justifications."
GARETH DAVIS	You don 't understand.
GARETH DAVIS	She's a friend of my sister's from college.
GARETH DAVIS	She just moved to the city and her uncle died last month.
GARETH DAVIS	I was just trying to be supportive.
GARETH DAVIS	Besides you're the one I want to sleep with.
CARRIE	When she felt her life take a fortuitous turn.
CHARLOTTE	"Gareth, I've got to go."
GARETH DAVIS	Wait. What
CHARLOTTE	Hi! Nice to see you.
LYDIA	I just came in to pay for my painting.
EILEEN	It's her painting for six months and then she's selling it back to me.
LYDIA	Excuse me.
LYDIA	I'm the one with the big loft and all the empty white walls.
LYDIA	Look at it.
LYDIA	I am so excited.
EILEEN	Excuse me.
EILEEN	"By the way, I love the Prada loafers."
CHARLOTTE	Thanks.
CARRIE	Power lesbians and their shoes are like Wall Street brokers and their cigars.
LYDIA	Alice told me so many nice things about you.
CHARLOTTE	How long have you been doing the art thing? Ten years.
CHARLOTTE	"No, 12 years."
CHARLOTTE	I'm losing track.
CHARLOTTE	Almost five years at this gallery.
LYDIA	What do you do? I'm a V.
LYDIA	P.
LYDIA	At Warner Music.
LYDIA	Eileen works on Wall Street.
CHARLOTTE	How long have you been together?
LYDIA	Used to be together. Five years.
LYDIA	We're just friends now.
CHARLOTTE	That is so cool.
EILEEN	Want to join Melissa and Drew in about an hour for a drink? Sure.
LYDIA	Would you like to join us for a drink?
CHARLOTTE	"I wish I could, but"
LYDIA	But what?
CARRIE	The truth is Charlotte couldn't think of one really good reason not to go.
CHARLOTTE	I'd love to.
CARRIE	"One drink at G-Spot, the hottest new girl bar in town followed by dinner and scintillating conversation at Luke's a hot new French-fusion restaurant with an even hotter chef followed by late-night dancing at Love Tunnel left Charlotte exhilarated and happy as she'd been in ages."
CARRIE	There was something relaxing and liberating in traveling in an alternate universe that contained no thought of men.
CARRIE	"By the end of the night, Charlotte had truly made some wonderful new friends."
CARRIE	"That night, Miranda was exhausted from her own night on the town."
CARRIE	She had spent the last four hours in the dark with Ethan watching the classic holocaust documentary Shoah.
ETHAN WATSON	"Shoah is so much better than that faky, stagy Schindler's List."
ETHAN WATSON	Narrative film can't begin to touch the horror of experience.
ETHAN WATSON	Only documentaries can really begin to capture the truth.
ETHAN WATSON	"In fact, the entire concept of narrative film is just bogus."
ETHAN WATSON	You know Want to come back to my place?
CARRIE	Miranda was pleased to discover that Ethan was as passionate in bed as he was on the subject of non-narrative film. But just as they were getting down to business Miranda realized they were not alone.
IRANDA	What's that for? Just something to get us in the mood.
ETHAN WATSON	"I think it's kind of sexy, don't you?"
IRANDA	"Yeah, I guess it could be."
CARRIE	Miranda realized that Ethan's passion for film had taken on a new and interesting twist.
CARRIE	"A few nights later, after a late show of Gimme Shelter at the Waverly Miranda discovered that Ethan's new friends were hard to shake."
IRANDA	Does That really need to be on?
ETHAN WATSON	No. It just really turns me on.
IRANDA	Aren't I enough?
ETHAN WATSON	You're great. I can turn off the sound if it bugs you.
ETHAN WATSON	Could you move your head a bit to the right?
IRANDA	Yeah.
ETHAN WATSON	That's great.
CARRIE	"That night, in Mr."
CARRIE	"Big's kitchen, I performed an unnatural act of my own."
CARRIE	I cooked.
CARRIE	Voila.
CARRIE	Fondue.
BIG	You didn't cook.
BIG	You just heated up cheese.
CARRIE	And tore up little pieces of bread.
BIG	I'm touched by your effort.
CARRIE	Okay.
CARRIE	It's the only recipe I could ever master.
CARRIE	All righty.
CARRIE	Now tell me you love it.
BIG	Tasty.
CARRIE	Now you tell me.
CARRIE	It's horrible.
BIG	Can we go to a restaurant now?
BIG	I take it back. You're an excellent cook.
CARRIE	I haven't told my friends we're seeing each other.
BIG	Neither have I.
CARRIE	That doesn't count.
CARRIE	You have no friends.
CARRIE	I have interested parties.
CARRIE	Why haven't you told them?
BIG	I sensed you didn't want me to.
CARRIE	Bullshit.
BIG	What do you want me to tell people?
CARRIE	Nothing.
BIG	Good idea. Let's keep it quiet.
CARRIE	Why do You want to Keep It quiet?
BIG	I Just want to be agreeable.
CARRIE	"The truth is, I wasn't sure why I wanted to keep the fact that I was seeing Big again so under wraps."
CARRIE	All I knew is that it felt somehow illicit.
CARRIE	I didn 't even want to be caught waking up there.
CARRIE	That morning at 7:00 a.
CARRIE	M as I walked the Walk of Shame back to my apartment
IRANDA	Carrie?
CARRIE	"Miranda, oh my god!"
IRANDA	What are you doing up here?
CARRIE	Teeth cleaning.
IRANDA	At 7:00 a.m.?
CARRIE	I like to get it over with. How's Ethan?
IRANDA	Aside from his porn addiction?
CARRIE	Still?
IRANDA	"It was kind of sexy at first, but it's getting borderline humiliating. ""Move your head here."
IRANDA	Move your head there.
IRANDA	""" Isn't the real thing more exciting than a tape?"
CARRIE	Maybe it's a force of habit.
IRANDA	I get the feeling he's more interested in the video than me.
IRANDA	Like he's cheating on me with them while we're having sex.
IRANDA	I don't know.
IRANDA	Am I expecting too much?
CARRIE	"No, you deserve his undivided attention."
IRANDA	Thank you.
IRANDA	I have to go.
IRANDA	I have a breakfast meeting.
IRANDA	You're dressed up for the dentist!
CARRIE	Laundry day.
IRANDA	got it.
CARRIE	"Bye, sweetie."
IRANDA	Bye
CARRIE	I felt horrible.
CARRIE	I had never lied to Miranda before.
CARRIE	But I was embarrassed to admit that I was seeing Big again.
CARRIE	"The truth was, I was cheating on her and all my friends with Mr."
CARRIE	Big.
CARRIE	"That afternoon, Samantha got very personal with her new trainer, Thor."
SAMANTHA	I feel like such a cliche.
SAMANTHA	I bet you sleep with all your clients.
THOR	"I really don't, but it's always been kind of a fantasy for me."
SAMANTHA	Maybe I Could train you.
THOR	Why don't we take a shower first? You got great legs.
SAMANTHA	"If I knew we were going to be doing this, I'd have shaved them."
THOR	That's all right.
THOR	I'll shave them for you.
THOR	Are you a dirty girl? I guess that depends on your definition of dirty.
CARRIE	And then to Samantha's surprise and delight Thor kept right on shaving.
SAMANTHA	What is this thing guys have these days about wanting to shave your pubic hair?
IRANDA	It's obvious. They want a little girl.
SAMANTHA	"Actually, in Thor's case, it was more like being branded."
IRANDA	What are you talking about?
SAMANTHA	He shaved me in a shape: A lightning bolt.
IRANDA	"Where do you find these guys? Carrie, are you listening to this? That very personal trainer of Samantha's shaved her crotch in the shape of a lightening bolt."
CARRIE	Really.
CARRIE	It's very creative.
CARRIE	Sort of like X marks the spot.
SAMANTHA	"You know, it's a very neglected area."
SAMANTHA	But people are really starting to pay attention.
SAMANTHA	You can't just let it grow wild.
SAMANTHA	There's an entire business devoted to the upkeep and management of pubic hair.
SAMANTHA	It says as much about you as shoes.
IRANDA	"Congratulations, it sounds like you found yourself a very talented stylist."
IRANDA	Carrie What are you doing in there?
CARRIE	You know what? Can somebody get that? I'll be out in a sec.
CHARLOTTE	Sorry I'm late.
SAMANTHA	You didn't have to get all dressed up for us.
IRANDA	Why not? You did your hair.
CHARLOTTE	It's not for you guys.
CHARLOTTE	I'm meeting Lydia and her friends tonight.
SAMANTHA	Who's Lydia?
IRANDA	Haven't you heard? Charlotte's a lesbian.
CHARLOTTE	I am not a lesbian.
CHARLOTTE	I just have some new lesbian friends.
IRANDA	She's been out with them three times this past week.
CHARLOTTE	So? They're cool and they buy art and their lives aren't complicated by men.
IRANDA	I was a major lesbian in the fourth grade.
IRANDA	Wendy Kirsten.
IRANDA	We kissed.
IRANDA	It was nice.
SAMANTHA	"They know you're straight, right?"
CHARLOTTE	"I'm sure they do, but we don't even talk about sex. It's a non-issue."
IRANDA	"You have to tell them, otherwise you're just leading them on."
SAMANTHA	You're nothing but a big clit tease.
CHARLOTTE	Are you saying that a straight woman and a gay woman can't be friends?
SAMANTHA	"Of course, but you can't expect to move to Wonder Woman's island and not go native."
CHARLOTTE	Where's Carrie?
IRANDA	"If she doesn't get out of the bathroom, we'll miss the movie."
SAMANTHA	Is everything okay in there?
CARRIE	"Actually, no. I need help."
CARRIE	This is embarrassing.
CARRIE	I got a new diaphragm and it's stuck.
IRANDA	How long has it been in there?
CARRIE	Since last night.
IRANDA	While you were getting your teeth cleaned this morning it was --
CARRIE	I'm either gonna have to make an emergency visit to my gynecologist or someone's gonna have to help me.
IRANDA	"I'd help you, but I'm not very dexterous."
IRANDA	"You're the lesbian, go in there."
CHARLOTTE	No.
SAMANTHA	Go.
SAMANTHA	And I just had my nails done.
SAMANTHA	You are so buying me dinner.
IRANDA	Wait.
IRANDA	Aren't we skipping a beat here? Who are you sleeping with?
CARRIE	It's something that started again a few weeks ago. I don't know if it's real so I didn't want to say anything.
CARRIE	It's Big.
IRANDA	You're sleeping with Big? He was such an asshole to you.
CARRIE	Not really.
CARRIE	Maybe sometimes.
SAMANTHA	Why do you think it'll be different this time?
CARRIE	"I don't know. I'm not sure they are, but it kind of feels okay."
IRANDA	"If it feels okay, why are you sneaking around?"
CARRIE	"We've got this physical, chemical kind of connection that's hard to shake. So lay off, okay? -"
IRANDA	Now it's gonna be a casual sex thing?
CARRIE	Maybe.
SAMANTHA	That's gonna work.
CHARLOTTE	even I am not That naive.
CARRIE	I'm really not in the mood to see a movie anymore.
GROUP	Come on!
CARRIE	"I couldn't sleep at all that night. The problem was, my friends were right."
CARRIE	"Falling into this casual thing with Big, without a sense of what happened or where it was going, suddenly felt like a huge mistake."
CARRIE	"The next morning, Charlotte attended brunch at the home of Patty Aston the ex-wife of a Hollywood television producer."
CARRIE	If power lesbians represented Manhattan 's chicest new social hive Charlotte was about to meet their queen bee.
LYDIA	Patty is an amazing lady.
LYDIA	She's on the board of 100 charities and now she's taking flying lessons.
LYDIA	She's got a house in Telluride.
LYDIA	We're all going there for Easter.
LYDIA	You should come.
CHARLOTTE	I'd love to.
CHARLOTTE	She also has some very interesting art.
PATTY ASTON	Diana the Huntress.
PATTY ASTON	I got her on sale.
LYDIA	This is Charlotte.
PATTY ASTON	A pleasure.
PATTY ASTON	I've heard so many wonderful things about you.
CHARLOTTE	Likewise.
LYDIA	I was telling Charlotte about your amazing house in Telluride.
CHARLOTTE	Sounds wonderful.
LYDIA	I'm gonna get us some drinks.
LYDIA	Champagne?
CHARLOTTE	Sure.
PATTY ASTON	Do you ski?
CHARLOTTE	"Yes, but not well. I guess I'm what you'd call a snow bunny."
CHARLOTTE	I just kind of hop down the bunny trail.
PATTY ASTON	"It's not a prerequisite, believe me."
PATTY ASTON	It's wonderful to leave the city and be in the mountains.
CHARLOTTE	Absolutely.
PATTY ASTON	You should plan to join us the next time.
PATTY ASTON	I know Lydia would love it if you could.
CHARLOTTE	That's very generous of you.
PATTY ASTON	"But before we get on a plane together, there's something we all want to know."
PATTY ASTON	Are you gay?
CHARLOTTE	"No, I'm not. But I do so enjoy the company of all these women."
CHARLOTTE	Everyone's so smart and funny.
CHARLOTTE	"After spending too much time and attention on men it feels like such a safe, warm environment."
CHARLOTTE	"And while sexually, I feel that I am straight there's a very powerful part of me that connects to the female spirit."
PATTY ASTON	"Sweetheart, that's all very nice but if you're not going to eat pussy, you're not a dyke."
CARRIE	"Later that afternoon, following a particularly grueling workout with Thor Samantha decided to take a relaxing steam."
WOMAN IN STEAM ROOM	That asshole!
CARRIE	That day at the gym Samantha discovered that lightning does indeed strike twice.
CARRIE	"That evening, Miranda was treated to a double bill."
CARRIE	Nanook of the North at Alice Tully Hall and Steady as She Blows at Ethan Watson's Porn Palace.
ETHAN WATSON	Hold it right there.
IRANDA	"All right, that's enough! This is not a synchronized event."
IRANDA	"Look, I like you."
IRANDA	But this is ridiculous.
IRANDA	It's either the women in the video or me.
IRANDA	"Your choice, but you can't have both."
ETHAN WATSON	It's not that simple.
ETHAN WATSON	I've only known you for a few weeks.
ETHAN WATSON	But I've been involved with these women for years.
IRANDA	I am so out of here.
CARRIE	"That night, for the first time ever, Big took me out dancing."
CARRIE	It was like he knew I needed to talk to him and decided to make it as difficult as possible.
CARRIE	"Our attraction, or addiction, or whatever, was strong."
CARRIE	But I knew I had to be stronger.
CARRIE	Does this mean we're seeing each other again? Officially?
BIG	If you say so.
CARRIE	That is an infuriating response.
BIG	"I don't know what ""officially"" means."
CARRIE	"""Officially"" means officially."
CARRIE	"You know, for real."
BIG	"Every moment of my life is for real, baby."
CARRIE	Just answer me this: Why did we break up?
BIG	You tell me. You're the one who left me high and dry with two tickets to St.
BIG	Barts.
CARRIE	You didn't say what I wanted to hear.
BIG	"Is that it? No, not just that."
CARRIE	I wanted to tell him I was afraid he could never love me the way I wanted to be loved.
CARRIE	I was afraid that he didn't really have the capacity to love anyone but himself.
CARRIE	"I was afraid that, given the chance, he'd break my heart again."
CARRIE	But I cheated and just said I guess I was afraid.
BIG	I can tell you one thing.
BIG	I sure did miss you officially.
CARRIE	Did you cry?
BIG	No. But I did listen to a hell of a lot of Sinatra.
CARRIE	And there it was.
CARRIE	I guess we were back together officially.
CARRIE	Whatever that means.
CARRIE	There are over seven million people in New York not including houseguests.
CARRIE	Visitors are a vital part of the city's economy.
CARRIE	Most single people in Manhattan do not buy furniture or hang pictures until the arrival of an out-of-towner.
CARRIE	That's a great couch.
CARRIE	Where'd it come from?
IRANDA	I have no idea.
CARRIE	"Everything in Miranda's new apartment was hand-picked, finished and arranged by Charlotte's friend, Madeline Dunn, an up-and-coming interior designer."
CARRIE	I've been looking for one of those.
ADELINE DUNN	That's very stylish for a pullout.
ADELINE DUNN	I'll have that end table for you tomorrow.
IRANDA	Thank you.
OVER	You're welcome.
CARRIE	This is a sofa bed?
IRANDA	That's what started this whole thing. I needed a sofa bed for Jeremy.
IRANDA	If he actually sleeps on it while staying in my fabulous apartment l'll throw myself out a window treatment.
CARRIE	Jeremy was an old friend of Miranda's who'd been in London writing for The Economist.
CARRIE	He was coming to New York to scope out the job situation.
CARRIE	"Miranda suggested he be her houseguest, because his e-mails, always entertaining had started to border on flirtatious."
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, I had become a frequent houseguest of Big's."
CARRIE	Do you have a spare toothbrush I could use?
BIG	A spare toothbrush?
CARRIE	I'll bring you a new one.
BIG	Excuse me.
CARRIE	There's only one pink brush head and Big was giving his to me.
CARRIE	It was the most encouraging moment so far in our relationship.
CARRIE	"The next night, Jeremy arrived."
CARRIE	He was more adorable than Miranda remembered.
JEREMY FIELDS	I love your flat.
IRANDA	Thanks. How the hell are you?
CARRIE	Especially when he said
JEREMY FIELDS	I'm tired of dating. I'm ready to get married.
ADELINE DUNN	"Miranda, are you here? Coming!"
IRANDA	That must be my end table.
JEREMY FIELDS	My end table is afraid to go out alone.
ADELINE DUNN	I hope you like the finish.
ADELINE DUNN	It's a hair darker than I was thinking.
ADELINE DUNN	Sorry to interrupt.
JEREMY FIELDS	That's beautiful.
JEREMY FIELDS	Is it Biedermeyer?
ADELINE DUNN	Inspired by Biedermeyer. good eye.
JEREMY FIELDS	I'm addicted to Architectural Digest.
JEREMY FIELDS	Jeremy Fields.
ADELINE DUNN	Madeline.
ADELINE DUNN	Madeline Dunn.
JEREMY FIELDS	Pleasure.
IRANDA	Thanks for bringing that by.
IRANDA	We were just about to get some dinner.
JEREMY FIELDS	Did you want to join us?
JEREMY FIELDS	"Last week, I was doing an interview at a restaurant in Kensington"
CARRIE	Miranda found herself in the situation every woman dreams of She was on a truly great first date.
JEREMY FIELDS	just be careful not to eat any buckshot!
CARRIE	"Unfortunately, it was somebody else's."
IRANDA	I should get Jeremy home.
IRANDA	You must be jet-lagged.
JEREMY FIELDS	"Actually, I feel great."
JEREMY FIELDS	I slept on the plane for once.
IRANDA	I'm pretty beat.
JEREMY FIELDS	Did you want to go?
IRANDA	Not if you're
JEREMY FIELDS	"Go ahead, I can find my way back."
IRANDA	Of course.
IRANDA	We don't have to Except I forgot to make a copy of the key.
ADELINE DUNN	Jeremy could use my key.
IRANDA	Of course.
IRANDA	I gave you a key.
IRANDA	Goodnight.
CARRIE	"I was at the same restaurant A week later, Miranda threw Jeremy a going away party."
JEREMY FIELDS	"I'd like to make a toast to my good friend Miranda who not only put me up, she threw this soirÃ©e in celebration of my departure."
JEREMY FIELDS	"Miranda, I get the hint."
JEREMY FIELDS	"I'd especially like to thank her for introducing me to Madeline an incredible, beautiful woman who must be drunk off her ass because she just agreed to marry me."
CARRIE	"Apparently, the only thing going away was Miranda's dream."
CHARLOTTE	Congratulations.
IRANDA	Ice.
IRANDA	We should get more ice.
IRANDA	"Everyone says, as soon as you get your own place, someone will propose."
IRANDA	I thought it would be to me.
CARRIE	"At the least, she owes you a mortgage payment."
IRANDA	How is this even possible? These people just met.
CHARLOTTE	It's love at first sight.
SAMANTHA	This isn't love.
SAMANTHA	This is two people justifying a week of non-stop fucking.
IRANDA	On my furniture.
IRANDA	I have to redecorate.
CHARLOTTE	I think this is encouraging.
CHARLOTTE	"Even if you're not dating anybody, you could be engaged in a couple of weeks."
CARRIE	Or you could be dating someone for a year and be thrilled to get an electric toothbrush head.
SAMANTHA	I don't understand why women are so obsessed about getting married.
SAMANTHA	Married people just want to be single again.
SAMANTHA	"If you're single, the world is your smorgasbord."
DAVE	"Can you tell me if this is where Jeremy Fields's engagement party is? It's the red awning, and it's a going away party."
SAMANTHA	I can take You there.
DAVE	were You going to the party?
SAMANTHA	I was leaving the party because there were no handsome men there. Maybe the tide is turning.
IRANDA	I get it.
IRANDA	My apartment is lucky for everybody but me.
CARRIE	What apartment isn't lucky for Samantha?
IRANDA	This is all your fault.
CHARLOTTE	What?
IRANDA	You introduced me to Madeline.
IRANDA	I could've hired a nice gay decorator and none of this would've happened.
CHARLOTTE	Madeline and Jeremy might've never met.
IRANDA	"Yes, and Jeremy would've fallen in love with me."
CARRIE	It's not like musical chairs.
IRANDA	Why not me? What am I doing wrong? Am I invisible?
DOORMAN	Can I help you?
IRANDA	I live here!
CARRIE	"That night, I needed a little reality check. I was just at this party and two people who met a week ago announced their engagement."
BIG	And?
CARRIE	I don't know. Isn't that a bit shocking?
BIG	This is New York. Nothing is shocking.
BIG	We've embraced public urination.
CARRIE	These people think they're soul mates.
BIG	"Did they actually use the term ""soul mates""?"
CARRIE	Several times.
BIG	"Then, I give them three months. What are you wearing?"
CARRIE	Do you believe in love at first sight?
BIG	I believe in lust at first sight.
CARRIE	I'm serious.
BIG	So am I.
BIG	"Come on, I need a visual."
CARRIE	"I don't know, a top, strapless."
CARRIE	It's denim.
CARRIE	Were you asleep when I called?
BIG	Yes
CARRIE	Sorry.
BIG	It's okay.
BIG	"But next time, be at the door naked."
CARRIE	I started to wonder.
CARRIE	In a city as cynical as New York is it still possible to believe in love at first sight?
ADELINE DUNN	"I'd completely given up on the idea. Now I know, the ones who don't believe in love at first sight have never experienced it."
CUTE INVESTMENT BANKER	Love at first sight is for Carmen Electra and Dennis Rodman.
CUTE INVESTMENT BANKER	It's too flaky for New York.
CUTE INVESTMENT BANKER	"Here, women want a blood test and an ATM receipt before you get their number."
BUSY FEMALE EXECUTIVE	How can you believe in love at first sight in a city where people jerk off on you in the subway?
CARRIE	A bride four weeks from her wedding doesn't have time to have a coffee.
CARRIE	"So, I joined Madeline for a mind-boggling hour in the presence of absolute certainty."
ADELINE DUNN	"Flowers, flowers, flowers everywhere."
ADELINE DUNN	"I'd like each bridesmaid to carry a different flower: Tulips, irises, lilies, Gerber daisies."
ADELINE DUNN	Charlotte should have the tulips. Did she say she's one of my bridesmaids?
CARRIE	She's thrilled.
ADELINE DUNN	I've asked Miranda to do the guest books since she introduced us.
ADELINE DUNN	"Carrie, I'm such a fan of your column."
ADELINE DUNN	Would you consider writing something to read at our wedding?
CHARLOTTE	What Does she want You to write?
CARRIE	a poem about love.
IRANDA	"Dear God, I hope you said no."
CARRIE	How can you say no to somebody who wants you to be involved in their wedding?
IRANDA	"If I knew, I wouldn't be in charge of the guest book."
CARRIE	"Why did I agree to this? I write about sex, not love. What do I know about love?"
SAMANTHA	I might have to get married.
CHARLOTTE	What?
SAMANTHA	The guy I picked up at Miranda's
IRANDA	"If you're engaged, I'm selling the apartment."
SAMANTHA	Hardly. We went back to my place.
DAVE	Tug my hair! Tug my hair! Tug my hair!
CARRIE	It all seemed so familiar. She was having a dÃ©jÃ  fuck.
DAVE	What's wrong?
SAMANTHA	I've slept with you before.
DAVE	"Yeah, like 15 years ago."
SAMANTHA	Why the hell didn't you say something?
DAVE	I thought you were playing the sexy stranger game.
CARRIE	So it was kind of a reunion.
CHARLOTTE	I don't understand. How could you forget someone you slept with?
CARRIE	"Toto, we're not in single digits anymore."
CHARLOTTE	It's not like you shared a cab with this guy. You slept with him.
SAM	Maybe we did It in a cab.
IRANDA	I'd like to forget some I've slept with.
CHARLOTTE	I keep a list.
IRANDA	"How sweet, ""Men to Do Today""."
SAMANTHA	I'm officially out of men to fuck.
SAMANTHA	I have to get married or move.
CARRIE	That's lovely. Can I use that in my poem?
SAMANTHA	It's yours.
CHARLOTTE	Wait till you see my bridesmaid's dress.
IRANDA	Is it hideous?
CHARLOTTE	"No, we got to pick our own. It's this amazing backless black satin."
SAMANTHA	Pretty sexy for a bridesmaid.
CHARLOTTE	"All Madeline said was, it had to be black!"
SAMANTHA	Calm down.
CHARLOTTE	I've been tasteful and appropriate at seven other weddings.
CHARLOTTE	"I'm always: ""Charlotte, Don't Look at Me, Look at the Bride!"" This time, people are gonna look at me!"
CARRIE	"For some reason, this whirlwind wedding was extremely stressful for everyone but the bride and groom."
CARRIE	"The next night, I made the mistake of telling Big about the poem."
BIG	"""Love, glove, dove"" ""Dove"" is good."
BIG	"""Love is like a dove ""Or big fuzzy glove"" Don't use that."
BIG	I might have stolen it from a greeting card.
CARRIE	"Okay, Thanks."
BIG	what? this is fun.
CARRIE	It's not supposed to be fun.
CARRIE	This is somebody's wedding.
CARRIE	A wedding is serious to some people.
BIG	"Then ""shove"" probably won't work."
BIG	When is this wedding?
CARRIE	It doesn't matter. You're not going.
BIG	"Yes, I am."
BIG	"I wouldn't miss you reciting ""Love, glove, dove"" in front of all New York for anything."
CARRIE	Things with Big were good.
CARRIE	He was going with me to a wedding.
CARRIE	"Can I just say, ""Wow."
CARRIE	""" I need a few minutes."
BIG	I left the card here for you to sign.
BIG	I don't need to sign.
BIG	They're your friends.
CARRIE	"They're not my friends and your name's on the invitation, too."
BIG	Really?
CARRIE	"Yes. It was my first time to get something other than, ""Carrie Bradshaw and Guest."
BIG	""" How'd they get my name?"
CARRIE	I don't know. Madeline must've asked Charlotte.
CARRIE	"Whatever, if you don't want to sign it's not a big deal."
IRANDA	Would you like to sign the guest book? Would you like to sign the guest book? Would you like to sign the guest book?
SAM	At least we get to see who's arriving alone.
CARRIE	Samantha could always be counted on to take life's lemons and make them into Spanish fly.
CARRIE	do You know where the gifts go?
IRANDA	"Excuse me, I'm not the gift person. That's another ""b"" list friend."
SAMANTHA	Christ! My rerun's here.
IRANDA	"Of course, you met him at the engagement party."
SAMANTHA	I have to start writing things down.
SAMANTHA	I also have to start drinking heavily.
IRANDA	Where's Big?
CARRIE	"Inside, looking bored."
IRANDA	That's my look.
CARRIE	Should I be bothered by the fact he wouldn't sign the card?
IRANDA	I'm glad I didn't ask him to sign the guest book.
CARRIE	That would've put him over the edge.
CARRIE	Charlotte wasn't kidding about the dress.
CARRIE	It was hard not to notice her.
IRANDA	Look at you! You look amazing.
CHARLOTTE	"My gosh, I am so late."
ARTIN HEALY	Are you with the bride or the groom?
CHARLOTTE	I'm a bridesmaid.
ARTIN HEALY	are You Charlotte?
CHARLOTTE	Yes.
ARTIN HEALY	"I'm Martin, I'll be walking you down the aisle."
CARRIE	"All her life, Charlotte had imagined doing exactly that with someone like Martin."
ARTIN HEALY	I'll show you where you're supposed to be.
IRANDA	Are you seeing this? I've been here half an hour.
IRANDA	He never looked at me.
CARRIE	"While Miranda was feeling invisible, I was feeling far too visible."
CARRIE	I'm in the program? I barely know the bride and groom.
IRANDA	they barely know each other.
CARRIE	I'm between the vows and the fish course.
IRANDA	Am I in there? Of course not.
CARRIE	I better find Big.
IRANDA	I'm coming with you.
CARRIE	Can you leave the guest book unattended?
IRANDA	It's a bullshit job. People know what to do.
CARRIE	"The ceremony was short and sweet, just like the engagement."
BANDLEADER	Please welcome our newlyweds Mr.
BANDLEADER	Jeremy Fields and Mrs.
BANDLEADER	Madeline Dunn Fields.
IRANDA	It's amazing.
IRANDA	"It took her months to find an end table, she plans a wedding at the Plaza in four weeks."
SAMANTHA	Five bucks says that your end table will last longer than her marriage.
ARTIN HEALY	People have said a lot of nice things about Jeremy and I'm here to make a rebuttal.
ARTIN HEALY	"Seriously, I've known Jeremy a long time"
IRANDA	Which is more than the bride could say.
ARTIN HEALY	I'm happy for you both.
ARTIN HEALY	"I only hope that someday I can have what you two have 8,000 little napkins with my name on them and, of course, someone to love."
ARTIN HEALY	Cheers.
ADELINE DUNN	Thank you.
ADELINE DUNN	Now we have a very special treat.
ADELINE DUNN	"One of my favorite writers, Carrie Bradshaw has agreed to share a poem that she wrote for the occasion."
CARRIE	Shit.
CARRIE	"As I made my way to the microphone, I could only think of one thing Dead Woman Walking."
CARRIE	"""His hello was the end of her endings ""Her laugh was their first step down the aisle ""His hand would be hers to hold forever ""His forever was as simple as her smile"" Suddenly, it hit me."
CARRIE	Two people were committing to a life together and I couldn't even get a guy to be on a card with me.
CARRIE	"""He said she was what was missing ""She said instantly she knew ""She was a question to be answered ""And ""His answer was, 'I do""' I had no choice but to embrace the moment and try to pass off my tears as tears of joy for the happy couple."
IRANDA	Charlotte Can I have the salad dressing?
CHARLOTTE	"I want three or four kids, too."
ARTIN HEALY	Where to you stand on dog vs.
ARTIN HEALY	"Cat? You know, I think this should be our song."
CHARLOTTE	We should dance to it.
CARRIE	"What, are they on the Evelyn Wood plan, too?"
BIG	Sorry. I had to take a call. Did I miss anything?
CARRIE	You missed my poem and most of the reception.
CARRIE	There's nothing like a slow dance to make you forgive and forget.
BIG	I hate to dance when people are eating.
CARRIE	I'll be at the bar where people are drinking.
IRANDA	Say hello to my date.
AN	I think I know you from somewhere.
SAMANTHA	It's very possible we fucked.
AN	"No, I think I know you from college."
SAMANTHA	"Then, we probably fucked in college."
SAMANTHA	"Another Cosmopolitan, please."
CARRIE	And a Scotch straight up.
SAMANTHA	"It's the famous poet, Carrie Bradshaw."
CARRIE	Can we not talk about the poem?
SAMANTHA	It was perfect. Except the crying. What was that about?
CARRIE	Big took a call during my poem.
CARRIE	It's not important to him.
CARRIE	Nothing is important to him.
IRANDA	Guess what? The Guest Book Person is also the Put the Gifts in the Van Person.
IRANDA	"Do you want to help, or should I go outside and wait for someone else not to see me so I can end it?"
CARRIE	I'll help. What street do you want to stand in?
IRANDA	"If they get married within a month, I'm not going. Careful, that's from me."
CARRIE	What are you giving them?
IRANDA	The dancing frogs.
CARRIE	Even while on the verge of breaking the land speed record for relationships Charlotte took her duties as bridesmaid very seriously.
CHARLOTTE	Isn't it beautiful?
ARTIN HEALY	How do we do this?
CHARLOTTE	"We just throw Silly String around and write funny things on the mirror in lipstick. Some people throw condoms on the bed, but I prefer rose petals."
ARTIN HEALY	I would love to wake up in rose petals.
CARRIE	It was all so romantic.
CARRIE	"The bed, the rose petals the bed Technically, it wasn't a third date but they'd already had dinner and been dancing."
CARRIE	"Twenty minutes later, Charlotte worried she'd made a rookie mistake by sleeping with a man she might marry."
CARRIE	But something wonderful happened.
ARTIN HEALY	I want to introduce you to my parents.
CHARLOTTE	Meeting the parents Charlotte was back on schedule.
RS. HEALY	Did you see us? We've been dancing up a storm.
R. HEALY	Would You like a free lesson?
ARTIN HEALY	my dad considers himself quite a dancer.
CHARLOTTE	That would be great.
RS. HEALY	Is she the one?
R. HEALY	You're a beautiful dancer.
CHARLOTTE	Thank you.
ARTIN HEALY	May I cut in?
R. HEALY	If you must.
ARTIN HEALY	Isn't he something? He's very smart.
ARTIN HEALY	He's pretty much my role model.
ARTIN HEALY	He used to take me to his office when I was little.
CHARLOTTE	Your father just felt me up.
ARTIN HEALY	what?
CHARLOTTE	we were dancing and he put his hand
ARTIN HEALY	My parents have been married for 50 years. My dad would not cop a feel just because some girl is wearing a slutty dress.
CARRIE	"Suddenly, it was clear to Charlotte that Martin wouldn't take her side now or after three or four kids, or ever."
CHARLOTTE	Did the last four and a half hours mean nothing to you?
IRANDA	"Darn, we missed the chicken dance."
BIG	"Excuse me, have you seen my date?"
CARRIE	"I'm sorry, I had to help Miranda put the gifts into the van."
BIG	Are you ready to go?
CARRIE	Have they even cut the cake yet?
BIG	"I don't know, but I can tell you how it turns out."
CARRIE	"If you want to go, go."
BIG	What's wrong?
CARRIE	You wouldn't even sign the card.
BIG	The card.
CARRIE	I'm afraid we don't want the same things.
BIG	Things like cake?
CARRIE	I want someone who's going to be with me until the end of a wedding.
BIG	Okay. I'll stay.
CARRIE	You will?
BIG	Yes.
BANDLEADER	Single ladies! It's time for the tossing of the bouquet.
BIG	Isn't the bouquet toss at the end?
CARRIE	"Congratulations, you lucked out. Get us some cake."
CARRIE	I want to say goodbye to my friends.
IRANDA	big moment.
CARRIE	big and I are leaving.
CARRIE	He's crossed his pain threshold and he's carrying me along.
ADELINE DUNN	"Everybody ready? One, two, three."
CARRIE	Okay girls. See you tomorrow.
CHARLOTTE	Let's get your coats.
CARRIE	Some people know they're meant to be together.
CARRIE	I knew I was meant to go home and have cake in bed with Big.
CARRIE	Maybe we're more the fuzzy glove types.
CARRIE	Once upon a second time around in a mythical land between Carmine and Mulberry streets two mere mortals were having a wonderful time.
BIG	This is the gangster I was telling you about.
PAOLO	Gangster? No.
PAOLO	No gangster.
PAOLO	"Come, this way."
BIG	Grazie.
BIG	This is Paolo.
BIG	"This is my girlfriend, Carrie."
BIG	Bread?
CARRIE	You've never called me your girlfriend before.
BIG	"Sure, I have."
BIG	Just not to your face.
BIG	Bravo!
PAOLO	"And now you wise guy, come on, it's your turn. Come on, come on."
BIG	me? Okay.
CARRIE	"not funny, Mr."
CARRIE	Sambuca.
BIG	"Relax, I'm a regular."
CARRIE	A regular?
BIG	I'd like to dedicate this song to the lovely lady sitting right over there.
BIG	"""When I was 17 ""It was a very good year ""It was a very good year ""For small town girls and soft summer nights ""We'd hide from the lights ""In the village green ""When I was 17"" It was perfect."
CARRIE	I felt like I was in heaven.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile across town, Miranda was in hell"
COMIC	Douche products
CARRIE	or its modern day equivalent: The comedy club.
ALAN MILLER	are we having fun yet?
IRANDA	when Does the comedy start?
ALAN MILLER	I've never been this close to suicide.
COMIC	Not pussy
ALAN MILLER	I'll get the check.
IRANDA	if You ditch me in this place I will hunt You down and kill you.
CARRIE	Alan Miller was a divorced architect she met in aisle three at the Food Emporium.
CARRIE	They immediately bonded over a shared hatred of designer croutons.
COMIC	"If all I was interested in was freshness then I would be fucking my salad crisper! Yo, Red."
COMIC	You wanna answer your fuckin' phone?
IRANDA	It's not my phone.
COMIC	Go ahead.
COMIC	Answer it.
CROWD	Answer it! Answer it!
IRANDA	"Alan Miller's phone. No, this is his date."
IRANDA	Who's this?
COMIC	"Who is it? I'm sorry, his date can't speak right now. Whom may I say is calling? His wife! Numb-nuts, your wife's on the phone."
IRANDA	You told me you were divorced.
ALAN MILLER	I'm not really divorced.
ALAN MILLER	I'm really separated.
IRANDA	"No, we're really separated."
IRANDA	"See, this is me, separating."
COMIC	"Red, not so fast."
COMIC	I'll fuck you.
IRANDA	"Honey If they're not married, they're gay, or burned from a divorce or aliens from the planet ""Don't date me."
CARRIE	""" It's amazing how many of them walk among us."
CARRIE	Only recognizable by their slightly larger heads.
IRANDA	"I asked him, point blank: ""How long have you been divorced?"" ""Three years."
IRANDA	""" Just like that. Three years."
IRANDA	Guys are such liars.
SAMANTHA	And 97% of them can't fuck you worth a damn!
IRANDA	"He tells me how much he likes me, and boom, I believe him. Am I that needy?"
CHARLOTTE	Maybe he really did like you.
IRANDA	"If you ""Pollyanna-out"" on me today I'll have to hit you with this rice pudding."
CHARLOTTE	"This married man fell madly in love with my friend, Amanda's friend, Ashley and he said he would get a divorce and he did."
CHARLOTTE	"They got married, moved to Connecticut and he is this amazing husband and father."
IRANDA	never happened.
CHARLOTTE	Excuse me?
IRANDA	Urban relationship myth.
IRANDA	Unbelievable fairy tales concocted by women to make their love lives seem less hopeless.
SAMANTHA	"Exactly. Except it makes you feel even more hopeless because this fabulous, magical relationship is never happening to you."
CHARLOTTE	It did happen.
IRANDA	Like the one about the guy who couldn't commit and the woman broke up with him and moved to Kansas.
IRANDA	"one night, she comes walking home"
CARRIE	In the rain!
IRANDA	"Always, in the rain. He stands there in front of her door with an engagement ring."
IRANDA	"He says, ""Marry me,"" and they live happily ever after."
CHARLOTTE	"But, it can happen."
CHARLOTTE	People do live happily ever after.
CHARLOTTE	"It happened to my friend, Amanda's friend."
SAMANTHA	It's always a friend who knows a friend Charlotte Honey.
SAMANTHA	Have you ever known anyone who's relationship changed magically overnight?
CHARLOTTE	Yes. Look at Carrie and Big.
CHARLOTTE	Their relationship is totally different than before.
IRANDA	How? How is it different?
CARRIE	It just is. I can't explain it.
CARRIE	"I can, but you're so scary right now, I won't."
IRANDA	"No, really, tell me."
CARRIE	It's just a feeling.
CARRIE	Something shifted Maybe we both know that if we came together again it must be for a reason. Why is that so hard to believe?
IRANDA	How much time have you got?
CARRIE	"That afternoon, I got to thinking about myths and relationships. Heroes, boyfriends, Cyclopses, divorced guys."
CARRIE	Are they really that different? The primitive Greeks clung desperately to myths to explain the random hopelessness of their miserable lives.
CARRIE	"Do modern day singles need modern day myths just to help us get through our random and sometimes miserable relationships? What about Big and me? After what seemed like an eternity of not quite fitting together, we suddenly fit."
CARRIE	Had the relationship God smiled? Or was that something I desperately needed to believe? Are we willing to believe anything to date? While Samantha had little belief in the idea of happily ever after she had a strong belief in the idea of a smart cocktail at the end of the work day.
CARRIE	"Samantha, a Cosmopolitan and Donald Trump."
CARRIE	You don't get more New York than that.
DONALD TRUMP	I gotta go.
DONALD TRUMP	Think about it.
DONALD TRUMP	I'll be at my office at Trump Tower.
ED	Excuse me.
ED	I was so distracted by your beauty I think I just agreed to finance Mr.
ED	Trump's new project.
ED	You owe me 150 million dollars.
SAMANTHA	Will you take a check?
ED	May I buy you a drink?
SAMANTHA	"I have one, thanks."
ED	Can I buy you an island?
SAMANTHA	"I don't know, can you?"
ED	The name's Ed.
SAMANTHA	Samantha.
ED	"So, Samantha, do you come here often?"
SAMANTHA	"Honey, that line's older than you are."
ED	You are a pistol.
SAMANTHA	Ed You have no idea.
CARRIE	"A bottle of their best champagne later Samantha had learned that Ed was single, available and a millionaire many, many times over."
SAMANTHA	What's your age ceiling with men?
CARRIE	Fifty?
SAMANTHA	Factor in millions and millions of dollars.
CARRIE	Fifty?
SAMANTHA	"Well, I just met the cutest older man."
CARRIE	"How old, fifty? Sixty? Is he on Medicare?"
SAMANTHA	I'm guessing 72.
SAMANTHA	A young 72.
SAMANTHA	Your silence reeks of ageism.
CARRIE	are You serious?
SAMANTHA	"he took me to dinner at Jean Georges. we got Right in, No reservation needed."
CARRIE	I wasn't aware that Jean Georges had an early bird special.
SAMANTHA	He's vibrant and powerful and generous.
SAMANTHA	He's just looking for someone to have a little fun with.
CARRIE	Would that include bedroom fun?
SAMANTHA	We haven't discussed it yet.
CARRIE	Are you telling me that you are seriously capable of having sex with a senior?
SAMANTHA	"You know the saying: ""All cats look the same in the dark."
CARRIE	""" It was pure urban legend."
CARRIE	"Alligators in the sewer, pets in the microwave and now an old man and Samantha."
BIG	Is this a piece of veal or is this a piece of veal?
CARRIE	That is a piece of veal.
CARRIE	"In every myth, there comes a point when the mere mortals are given a test."
CARRIE	The way they respond usually determines whether they find paradise or are tied to a big rock for all eternity.
CARRIE	I have a huge request.
CARRIE	I want you to know my friends better.
BIG	I know your friends fine.
BIG	Charlotte is the brunette.
BIG	Miranda is the redhead.
BIG	And Samantha is trouble.
CARRIE	I want them to know you better.
CARRIE	They've never really spent time with you and you're so funny and cute.
BIG	Carrie What is it you need?
CARRIE	I want us all to have dinner Saturday night at Denial. Denial was a very popular Manhattan hot spot.
CARRIE	"Apparently, everyone in Manhattan wanted to be ""in Denial."
BIG	""" Okay."
CARRIE	Why are you suddenly so
BIG	cute?
CARRIE	Yes. Why are you so cute? Hello?
IRANDA	Where are you? I've been waiting here forever.
CARRIE	Didn't you get the message I left on your machine an hour ago?
IRANDA	No. I didn't call home.
IRANDA	Is everything all right? I thought you were dead or something.
CARRIE	I'm fine.
CARRIE	I'm at Big's.
IRANDA	You're at Big's? You and I are having dinner tonight.
CARRIE	"Well, he got this veal."
IRANDA	You blew me off for a piece of politically incorrect meat?
CARRIE	"Well, he wanted to make me dinner."
IRANDA	You just dropped your life and ran right on over to his?
CARRIE	I can't get into that right now.
IRANDA	You know what? You're relationship is the same as always.
IRANDA	It's all about him.
CARRIE	"Could you put Miranda on, please?"
IRANDA	Enjoy your veal.
BIG	Problem?
CARRIE	No.
IRANDA	I'll have another glass of wine.
STEVE BRADY	Please.
IRANDA	Please what?
STEVE BRADY	"I'll have another glass of wine, please."
IRANDA	Are you allowed to talk to me like that?
STEVE BRADY	I think I am. Enjoy.
IRANDA	Thank you.
STEVE BRADY	"Steve, thank you, Steve."
IRANDA	That's really very cute but I'm not in the mood.
STEVE BRADY	"I'm not really in the mood, Steve."
IRANDA	"I'm not a total bitch, I just had a fight with somebody."
STEVE BRADY	Yeah I heard. Boyfriend?
IRANDA	None of your business.
STEVE BRADY	Girlfriend? Butcher.
IRANDA	Butcher?
STEVE BRADY	The veal. I took a shot.
IRANDA	What are you reading?
STEVE BRADY	"The Joy of Bartending, Hemingway."
IRANDA	"So, what, you're funny?"
STEVE BRADY	"Slow down, that's a nice Cotes du Rhone."
STEVE BRADY	Enjoy.
STEVE BRADY	It's on me.
IRANDA	Why would that be?
STEVE BRADY	"A bribe, so, you'll hang out and talk. If you leave, I'll have to listen to those NYU kids with the Amstel Lights discuss Fiona Apple."
STEVE BRADY	I'm begging you.
CARRIE	They did a little more than talk.
CARRIE	"After work they went back to her place where Steve, the bartender served Miranda two orgasms, straight up."
STEVE BRADY	So that was really special.
IRANDA	Sure.
IRANDA	Is that your shirt over there?
STEVE BRADY	Can I get your phone number?
IRANDA	Why?
STEVE BRADY	To call you up and ask you for a date.
IRANDA	Look
STEVE BRADY	"Steve. Look, Steve."
IRANDA	You don't have to do this.
IRANDA	You don't have to make believe you're gonna call.
IRANDA	Let's just call this what this was: A one-night stand.
STEVE BRADY	You're a real pisser.
STEVE BRADY	"Stop by the bar, see me sometime."
IRANDA	"Sure, okay."
IRANDA	Whatever.
IRANDA	Thanks.
IRANDA	Bye.
IRANDA	Great sex.
CARRIE	Three dinners and two extravagant lunches later Ed invited Samantha over to his townhouse.
CARRIE	"Up until now, she would never have believed she would consider a relationship with an older man."
CARRIE	Bu there was something about Ed.
ED	How did that get there?
ED	I wonder if
SAMANTHA	"Ed, no."
CARRIE	After an impressive six-course dinner Ed put the moves on Samantha.
CARRIE	Ed's moves were from a different dating time.
CARRIE	Moves she had heard of or seen in old movies but moves she never thought she'd experience firsthand.
ED	I used to groove with these cats in Cuba.
SAMANTHA	What's the matter Ed? Can't afford the light bill?
ED	You're fun.
ED	A toast to fun.
ED	What the hell! I'm gonna lay my cards on the table.
ED	I've only got a handful of good years left.
SAMANTHA	No Ed
ED	10 to 12 tops. I'm looking for someone to have some fun with.
ED	I'm aware that a gorgeous woman like you can get any young man you want.
ED	I'm willing to make it worth your wild.
ED	And speaking of wild don't worry.
ED	"I got a big, old pocketful of Viagra."
SAMANTHA	"Why, Ed."
SAMANTHA	That's not Viagra.
CARRIE	Samantha was suddenly living her own urban relationship myth.
CARRIE	The woman who stopped for a cocktail after work and lived happily ever after.
CARRIE	"For 10 to 12 years, tops."
SAMANTHA	I think in the dark is sexier.
SAMANTHA	Could you get that light behind you?
CARRIE	"In the dark, she learned that all cats not only look the same but felt the same. Ed's lips were not the lips of an older man."
CARRIE	Ed's touch was not the touch of an older man.
ED	"Excuse me, baby."
ED	Little boy's room.
CARRIE	Unfortunately Ed's ass was the ass of an older man.
CARRIE	She told him it was a bad reaction to the shellfish from dinner.
CARRIE	"Saturday afternoon, Miranda was at home enjoying a cup of coffee and her New York Times when fate came knocking."
IRANDA	Yes?
STEVE BRADY	It's Steve.
IRANDA	Steve who?
STEVE BRADY	"Steve Brady, the bartender."
IRANDA	What do you want?
STEVE BRADY	You want your neighbors to hear? Hi. Thanks for letting me in.
IRANDA	did You forget something?
STEVE BRADY	"No, I didn't have your number and I wanted to tell you something. I like you."
IRANDA	"Translation: ""I think you're an easy lay and I'd like to have sex again."
STEVE BRADY	""" It's not like that."
STEVE BRADY	Have dinner with me.
IRANDA	Why?
STEVE BRADY	"I don't know, because we're hungry."
IRANDA	I can't have dinner with you.
IRANDA	I don't even know you.
STEVE BRADY	You slept with me.
IRANDA	It's a different thing.
STEVE BRADY	How 'bout tonight?
IRANDA	I have plans.
STEVE BRADY	You don't have plans.
IRANDA	I do.
STEVE BRADY	"What plans? Quick, before you make one up."
IRANDA	I'm meeting my friends downtown at Denial for dinner.
STEVE BRADY	My buddy works there.
STEVE BRADY	I'll meet you for a drink. What time?
IRANDA	7 .
STEVE BRADY	Okay. What time are you really meeting them?
IRANDA	9
CARRIE	"At 8:15, I arrived at Big's."
CARRIE	One quick drink and we'd be out the door.
CARRIE	I told myself all day it was just another dinner with friends.
CARRIE	"But, as I stood waiting, in my new, very favorite dress I realized it meant a lot more."
BIG	"Hi, baby, c'mon in."
CARRIE	"You're not properly attired to meet my friends, mister."
CARRIE	Hop to it.
BIG	"About that Do you mind if I don't go? I've been out all day, it's gonna rain."
CARRIE	But my friends are expecting you.
BIG	"I know, but they're your friends and they'll be fine with just you."
BIG	Is it okay?
CARRIE	Sure. I was afraid if I looked up into his eyes I'd turn to stone.
CARRIE	"How could I have let myself believe things would be different the second time around? I'd never heard of a myth in which a self-centered, 42-year-old baby magically transformed into a grown man that you could bring out in public."
CHARLOTTE	They won't seat us 'til all of our party is here.
CHARLOTTE	How long do you think Big will be?
CARRIE	"I'm not sure, he's coming from work. I didn't have the strength to tell them about my fallen hero."
CARRIE	Not without a cocktail.
CARRIE	"I figured as long as I was ""in Denial,"" I might as well stay there."
SAMANTHA	Look at you.
STEVE BRADY	"If you want good service, send a bartender."
IRANDA	"If you want a good fuck, go home with one."
IRANDA	Hello! It was funny!
STEVE BRADY	"Miranda Can I talk to you over there, for a second?"
IRANDA	The gods are punishing me for having casual sex.
STEVE BRADY	Thank you.
STEVE BRADY	One quick question and I'm out of here.
STEVE BRADY	Why do you hate guys so much?
IRANDA	Excuse me?
STEVE BRADY	"We just met, so I know that it ain't all about me."
STEVE BRADY	Wait.
IRANDA	What do you want?
STEVE BRADY	I just wanna get to know you better. Do me a favor.
STEVE BRADY	"Can you, for a second, believe that maybe I'm not some ""full-of-shit"" guy? That maybe I do like you? That maybe the other night was special? Do you think maybe you can believe that?"
IRANDA	No. Maybe I've just slept with too many bartenders.
SAMANTHA	Are you okay?
IRANDA	I don't wanna talk about it.
STEVE BRADY	"Nice meeting you all, excuse me."
CARRIE	Maybe we should get a table for four.
IRANDA	I knew it.
IRANDA	Big's not coming.
IRANDA	Men are shit.
CHARLOTTE	"What are you talking about? He's coming, isn't he?"
CARRIE	"I didn't know if I had the heart to tell Charlotte that ""happily ever after"" really was just a myth."
CHARLOTTE	"See, there he is!"
BIG	It's really coming down out there.
CARRIE	You remember my friends?
BIG	"Of course, I do. Hello, ladies."
CARRIE	Seeing Big show up for me shook Miranda's lack of belief system to the very core.
IRANDA	Excuse me.
BIG	More drinks?
CARRIE	"Just like that, Miranda left Denial."
IRANDA	Steve! Maybe I can believe it.
CARRIE	"From that night on, promiscuous women everywhere would tell the tale of the one-night stand that turned into a relationship."
CARRIE	As for Big and me
BIG	"So, Samantha tell me. Did you ever get it on with that old coot?"
CARRIE	That was the night we stopped being a myth and started becoming real.
CARRIE	They say that the women in New York are the most beautiful women in the world.
CARRIE	Which explains why men in New York spend all their time looking at them.
CARRIE	The city is a veritable playground for men's roving eyes.
CARRIE	"Unfortunately, they need both of them looking straight ahead to survive."
CARRIE	This New York woman was pretty happy. I was seeing Big again.
CARRIE	"Unfortunately, my New York guy was still seeing other women."
SAMANTHA	"If checking out other women is the biggest problem you are having with him, you're lucky."
CARRIE	"-If it's so small, he should be able to stop."
SAMANTHA	-You can't change that about a man.
CARRIE	"It's part of their genetic code, like farting."
CARRIE	-You're gonna put me off my pretzel.
SAMANTHA	You have to take big the way he is.
SAMANTHA	"Once you try to change a man, it's doomed. They won't budge an inch."
CARRIE	"I know, but you can subtly manipulate and cajole."
SAMANTHA	The only things you can work on are their hair and wardrobe.
SAMANTHA	"-But even then, it's a constant battle."
CARRIE	I already like the hair and wardrobe.
SAMANTHA	"Then be happy. Honey, no man is perfect."
CARRIE	"I'm not asking for perfection, I'm just looking for slight alterations."
SAMANTHA	"Be careful with alterations. If you pull the wrong thread, everything falls apart."
CARRIE	While Samantha and I discussed the theory of change...
CARRIE	...Miranda was going through it for real.
CARRIE	"She had a new apartment, a new boyfriend..."
CARRIE	...and a new dating schedule that was killing her.
STEVE	Hey. I'm sorry. I thought we'd be closing the bar earlier.
STEVE	You were asleep.
IRANDA	"-No, I'm up. Hi. Come on in."
STEVE	Come here. You okay? Let's see.
STEVE	is That better?
IRANDA	-That's better. Thank you.
STEVE	How was your night?
IRANDA	I don't know. I was asleep.
STEVE	I'm sorry I was late.
STEVE	We were gonna close the bar at 2:00.
STEVE	Then we got this big group of Japanese bankers came in.
STEVE	And all they want is these big flaming drinks.
STEVE	Then one of them got sick and....Never mind.
CARRIE	Everything was great about Steve except for one thing.
STEVE	morning.
IRANDA	morning.
STEVE	Come here.
CARRIE	They had completely opposite schedules.
CARRIE	Steve had all the time in the world in the morning.
CARRIE	"Miranda got right up at 7:00. Unfortunately, Steve did, too."
IRANDA	I have to Go to work.
STEVE	Not yet.
CARRIE	The only thing she liked inside her in the morning...
CARRIE	...was the cup of take-out coffee she drank on the way to the subway.
CARRIE	"That night, in a bed across town..."
CARRIE	"...Charlotte was seeing a lot of Mike, a cute, but feared restaurant critic..."
CARRIE	...famous for his patented five-whisk rating system.
CHARLOTTE	Mike?
IKE	Yeah?
CHARLOTTE	Let's make love.
IKE	You are a five-whisk woman.
CARRIE	But just when Charlotte had become comfortable with the penis...
CARRIE	...she got a very unexpected surprise.
CHARLOTTE	You're....It's....
IKE	Uncircumcised. Is that okay?
CHARLOTTE	No. Sure. Of course it is.
CARRIE	It was not okay. The only uncut version of anything Charlotte had ever seen...
CARRIE	...was the original Gone with the Wind.
CHARLOTTE	"There was so much skin, it was like a Shar-Pei!"
CARRIE	-You've never seen an uncircumcised one?
CHARLOTTE	-I'm from Connecticut!
IRANDA	"Reminder: you're dating the guy, not the penis."
CHARLOTTE	Aesthetics are important to me.
SAMANTHA	"It's not what it looks like, it's what they can do with it."
CHARLOTTE	I don't need one that can make its own carrying case!
SAMANTHA	"Personally, I love an uncircumcised dick."
SAMANTHA	"It's like a Tootsie Pop. Hard on the outside, with a delicious surprise inside."
IRANDA	I don't like surprises. I like it all out there where I can see it.
CHARLOTTE	"Same here. I'm sorry, it is not normal."
CARRIE	"Actually, it is. Something like 85% men aren't circumcised."
CHARLOTTE	"-Great, now they're taking over the world!"
CARRIE	"-It's a penis, not Godzilla."
IRANDA	If 85% aren't circumcised...
IRANDA	"...that means I've only slept with 15% of the population, tops."
CARRIE	You're practically a virgin.
CHARLOTTE	"You know, he's a nice, waspy guy. What went wrong?"
CARRIE	Maybe his parents were hippies and didn't believe in it.
IRANDA	I am So circumcising my kids.
CARRIE	I think You can pay people to do That now.
IRANDA	I don't ever wanna know there's a woman out there calling my son a Shar-Pei.
SAMANTHA	"All I'm saying is, uncut men are the best. They try harder."
SAMANTHA	I should know. I've slept with five of them.
CHARLOTTE	out Of how many?
CARRIE	Infinity.
CARRIE	"That night, Big and I went out to celebrate absolutely nothing."
BIG	more grappa?
CARRIE	"No, Thank ya."
CARRIE	"Listen, my editor called me today and she's...."
BIG	You were saying?
CARRIE	"Yes, I was."
HOSTESS	Excuse me; you can't smoke that in here.
BIG	"Really? You're absolutely, positively sure about that?"
BIG	Because I checked the zoning on this particular table...
BIG	...and I'm pretty sure this table is in a cigar-friendly zone.
HOSTESS	"I don't mind, but it's for the other patrons."
BIG	"You mean if those five patrons don't mind, it's okay with you?"
HOSTESS	"-Sir, I'm gonna have to-"
BIG	-Just one second.
BIG	Excuse me; this is my last day on earth.
BIG	I'm being executed tomorrow morning. That's my parole officer there.
BIG	"Would you mind terribly if I smoked this, ladies?"
BIG	Thank you.
BIG	"Excuse me, I'm sorry. Would it be okay if I smoked this?"
BIG	"Please, let me preface this by saying: I'd like to buy everybody a round of drinks."
BIG	"Apparently, the other patrons aren't bothered at all."
CARRIE	I didn't have the guts to tell Big that he was actually kind of bothering me.
CARRIE	They won't tell you the truth.
CARRIE	No one is gonna say to your face they hate your cigar.
BIG	Good.
CARRIE	You are very arrogant.
BIG	I thought that's what you liked about me.
CARRIE	Maybe Big was right.
CARRIE	Maybe we were at that inevitable point in the relationship...
CARRIE	...when all those little things you loved about the other person become huge liabilities.
CARRIE	"And just then, a huge liability walked by."
BIG	What?
CARRIE	I hate that cigar.
BIG	And you told me right to my face.
CARRIE	New York City is all about change.
CARRIE	"New Yorkers change their haircuts, their politics, even their friends in the blink of an eye."
CARRIE	"If change was so easy, why was it so hard for Big?"
CARRIE	"Was I banging my head against the wall, thinking I can get him to stop and notice me?"
CARRIE	Did I have to change my expectations or was it possible...Can you change a man?
WOMAN	My husband used to be obsessed with watching sports 24 hours a day.
WOMAN	Then I started fooling around with his best friend.
WOMAN	And now he's obsessed with watching me.
AN	Every girlfriend I've had wants me to change something.
AN	"Change your job, change your friends, change your attitude."
AN	The only thing I ever change is girlfriends.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, Charlotte was about to discover that some men can change."
CHARLOTTE	Thanks for dinner. It was great.
IKE	Can I come upstairs with you?
CHARLOTTE	"I have to get up really early, and my place is just a mess."
IKE	"Look, I understand."
CHARLOTTE	You do?
IKE	"Yeah, What happened the other night."
IKE	You're not the first woman to react to it that way. I've gotten it most of my life.
CHARLOTTE	Really?
IKE	"Yeah, and I've decided to do something about it."
IKE	"I've been uncomfortable for too long, so I'm getting circumcised."
CHARLOTTE	Can you do that?
IKE	"Yeah. I mean, it hurts. It takes a long time to heal."
IKE	But I'm willing to do that. I want to feel good about making love.
CHARLOTTE	That is so sweet.
IKE	do You mind waiting?
CHARLOTTE	"No, not at all."
CARRIE	"Apparently, Samantha was wrong. Some men could budge an inch."
CARRIE	"In Mike's case, it may have been more like an inch and a half."
CARRIE	"The next morning, Miranda was getting her usual wake-up call."
STEVE	Where you going?
IRANDA	-I'm getting up.
STEVE	"-Come on, it's Saturday."
STEVE	"Come on, lay down, slow down. Come here."
IRANDA	How long are we gonna do this?
STEVE	You want a time frame for cuddling?
IRANDA	-Yeah. Like 20 minutes? 30?
STEVE	You're kidding me.
IRANDA	It helps if I have an end point in mind. I respond well to limits.
STEVE	"That's your problem, you got too many limits. You gotta let go a little."
IRANDA	"Look. Saturday is my free day, right? I have spinning and then I get my dry cleaning."
IRANDA	Then I get my nails done and I do my grocery shopping for the week.
IRANDA	okay?
STEVE	-You're not sounding very free to me.
IRANDA	"Do you want to come with me and get my dry cleaning? No, I didn't think so."
STEVE	"An hour and a half, tops."
CARRIE	"Twelve hours later, Steve went to work."
CARRIE	"About the same time, we went out to our favorite bar..."
CARRIE	...which on Saturdays changes into drag queen bingo.
SAMANTHA	"Come on, N-23."
IRANDA	"I really like him, but this morning thing is killing me."
IRANDA	It's bad enough we've never done it at night.
IRANDA	"After we do it in the morning, he just wants to lie there with me."
CHARLOTTE	Everyone wants a guy who wants to cuddle.
BINGO CALLER	"O-33, Ladies."
SAMANTHA	Shit!
CARRIE	I'm jealous. Big won't even spend the night at my place.
CARRIE	What You have is real intimacy.
IRANDA	-It's bed arrest.
IRANDA	"I've been horizontal all day, and I had errands to do. I missed spinning."
CARRIE	You don't have to spin if you're having sex.
BINGO CALLER	B-12!
SAMANTHA	-How about N-23?
CHARLOTTE	"-I don't know why I play this, I never win."
IRANDA	Why do I have to be the one to change my routine?
CHARLOTTE	Maybe because you really like the guy. It wouldn't kill you to slow down a little.
CARRIE	Miranda's right.
CARRIE	Why is it the woman who always has to change and never the guy?
CHARLOTTE	because we are more adaptable.
SAMANTHA	I love morning sex.
IRANDA	I haven't done morning sex since I was in college when I didn't have class till 11:00.
CHARLOTTE	Maybe you guys should come up with a schedule or something.
IRANDA	A sex schedule? Very romantic!
SAMANTHA	Surprise him at the bar wearing nothing but a trench coat and a smile.
CARRIE	That would be a happy hour.
CHARLOTTE	I think that if you really believe in the relationship you should work at it.
IRANDA	This from a woman who dumped a guy over foreskin.
CHARLOTTE	"Actually, we're still dating."
CARRIE	the Shar -Pei?
CHARLOTTE	-He's getting circumcised.
CARRIE	Please tell me that we're not invited to the Briss.
SAMANTHA	"Can I get another board, please?"
BRAD	Samantha?
SAMANTHA	Yes.
BRAD	"It's me, Brad."
SAMANTHA	Brad McColskey?
CARRIE	Brad was a semi-professional hockey player...
CARRIE	...Samantha had dated a few years back.
CARRIE	Apparently the only thing he was checking these days were his pants at the door.
BRAD	"Look at you, Miss Thing. You look fabulous."
SAMANTHA	So do you.
SAMANTHA	when did You start doing....
BRAD	"about five years ago, Right after you."
SAMANTHA	"Maybe Samantha was wrong. Apparently, she could change a man."
SAMANTHA	how are the kids?
BRAD	Good. Jake is in second grade.
CARRIE	Jake has two mommies.
HOSTESS	"There are other people here who need boards, Samantha."
BRAD	"Take a chill pill, Miss Saigon!"
SAMANTHA	Samantha?
BRAD	Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Gotta go. Enjoy the game.
BINGO CALLER	N-23.
ANOTHER PLAYER	Bingo!
SAMANTHA	I am so much prettier than him.
CARRIE	"Two hours later, I was supposed to meet Big at his place."
CARRIE	"Two and a half hours later, he showed up."
BIG	Sorry.
CARRIE	You're a half hour late. Your doorman thinks I'm a hooker.
BIG	did You make Any money?
CARRIE	not funny. I hate Waiting here for you.
BIG	There's a coffee shop around the corner you could have waited in.
CARRIE	-You know what? I'm gonna go.
BIG	-Don't be pissed.
CARRIE	I'm pissed.
BIG	Come upstairs.
CARRIE	"You know, if you gave me a key, I could wait upstairs next time."
BIG	A key?
CARRIE	Or you can stay at my place sometimes. It's easy to pick my locks.
BIG	"Yeah, but then I like my bed."
BIG	Look at that service. Come on.
CARRIE	"That night, something else changed. Neither of us wanted to make love."
CARRIE	"If this was all I was ever gonna get out of Big, was it enough for me?"
CARRIE	"Then at 3:00 a.m., somewhere between sleep and waking..."
CARRIE	...I got my answer.
CARRIE	-Damn it!
BIG	what?
BIG	are You All right?
CARRIE	-No!
BIG	What the fuck?
CARRIE	-My God!
BIG	What the hell was that?
CARRIE	-You knocked me out of bed!
CARRIE	-You didn't even know I was here!
BIG	-I do now. Why don't you break my arm the next time?
CARRIE	-I'm sorry.
BIG	-Jesus!
BIG	"All right, Sugar Ray, the bed's all yours."
CARRIE	where You going?
BIG	to sleep on the couch.
CARRIE	"Wait, Would You Just let me explain?"
BIG	-Don't talk now. Bad to talk now.
CARRIE	But I couldn't sleep.
CARRIE	"And at 4:00 a.m., I decided he couldn't sleep either."
CARRIE	It's ice for your face.
BIG	"Yes, I can feel that."
CARRIE	"Okay, I know I've lost a little of my power here."
CARRIE	I'm pretty sure that most women's magazines...
CARRIE	...would say that what I just did was a very bad idea.
CARRIE	"But the thing is, the other night wasn't just about the cigar."
BIG	It never is.
CARRIE	I hate that you look at other women.
CARRIE	I hate that I don't have a key to your place. You've never spent the night at my place.
CARRIE	You can't even make space for me in your bed.
CARRIE	And it's not your fault because I never say it.
CARRIE	So now I punched you. So now I have to say it.
CARRIE	So now I'm gonna say it.
CARRIE	I feel like I'm back in your life and nothing has really changed.
CARRIE	"I know you can't change a man, and you definitely can't change a man like you."
CARRIE	But...I still want...something to change a little bit...for me.
BIG	Physical violence is never the answer.
CARRIE	I'm gonna go.
CARRIE	Does It hurt?
BIG	Yes.
CARRIE	"Look, I'm sure there are things you don't like about me."
BIG	I'm not falling for that one.
CARRIE	That was one thing I liked about Big. He definitely knew when to shut up.
CARRIE	"The next night, Charlotte took Mike out for a post-operative scotch."
CHARLOTTE	Did it hurt?
IKE	"On a scale of one to five, I'd give it a 72."
CHARLOTTE	You poor thing.
IKE	-That's all right.
IKE	The worst is over. Now I just accept sympathy and heal.
CHARLOTTE	for how long?
IKE	about another week Or so.
CHARLOTTE	-I can't wait.
IKE	"me either. God, You really turn me on."
IKE	You should go.
CARRIE	"Much later that night, bolstered by coffee..."
CARRIE	...Miranda decided to perform a 2:00 a.m. seduction.
IRANDA	Hello.
STEVE	Look at you! You look great. What's the occasion?
IRANDA	It's 2:00 a.m. and I am still awake.
IRANDA	I thought we could celebrate. I've had five cups of coffee.
STEVE	That's worth a party.
IRANDA	Meet me in the bedroom. I'll get the wine.
IRANDA	get up.
STEVE	what?
IRANDA	I think you should spend the night at your place tonight.
STEVE	Why?
IRANDA	-Because I'd really like to catch up on my sleep.
IRANDA	I really don't want to worry about having sex with you in the morning...
IRANDA	...and then just Iying there and being late.
STEVE	-You don't like having sex with me.
IRANDA	"No, I do. I love it."
IRANDA	"But just once I would like to do it at night, like other normal Homo sapiens."
STEVE	"Relax, we can have sex now."
IRANDA	-We can't have sex now!
IRANDA	"I had a window, and it happened half an hour ago!"
STEVE	You had a window for sex?
IRANDA	"-I'm sorry, I'm a lawyer. I get tired."
STEVE	I'm a bartender and I get awfully tired of dealing with other people's neuroses.
STEVE	"When you get, you know...a picture window, or a whole doorway of time...call me."
CARRIE	Miranda had never felt less like a successful lawyer in her life.
CARRIE	"Even though she'd won her case, she'd also been left with all the damages."
CARRIE	"A week later, Charlotte finally got her chance to break in the new merchandise."
IKE	What do you think?
CHARLOTTE	It's perfect.
CARRIE	It was like her birthday and Christmas rolled into one.
IKE	You realize this makes me a virgin.
CHARLOTTE	I'll be gentle.
CHARLOTTE	That was really wonderful.
IKE	It was. A five.
CHARLOTTE	So what do you want to do Saturday night?
IKE	Saturday? Did we have plans?
CHARLOTTE	"No, but I thought maybe we could go to this drama league benefit..."
CHARLOTTE	"...or we could, you know, go low-key and stay in and rent videos."
IKE	"Hang on, listen."
IKE	"I don't think I'm ready for this to be, you know, like a big thing."
CHARLOTTE	A big thing?
IKE	I just feel like I can't be tied down right now.
IKE	There's a whole new me happening. I should get out there and share it.
CHARLOTTE	You want to share your penis?
IKE	Well...yeah.
IKE	I mean I feel like I owe it to myself to take the doggie out for a walk around the block...you know?
CARRIE	Charlotte never saw Mike again.
CARRIE	She realized you can take the Shar-Pei out of the penis...
CARRIE	...but you could never take the dog out of the man.
CARRIE	"A few days later, I realized you could change a man."
CARRIE	You could change him into not calling you.
CARRIE	Hi. Look at that.
BIG	"No, you look at it. I've seen it already."
CARRIE	Sorry.
BIG	"Easy, no hands near the face."
CARRIE	Come in.
BIG	I just came over to tell you something.
CARRIE	"You're suing me, right?"
BIG	"Look, maybe you need a key to know that I'm crazy about you."
BIG	"But the thing is, I've given out, like, five keys..."
CARRIE	...and you never get'em back.
BIG	And maybe I hog my bed. But I mean it's my bed and I like you in it.
CARRIE	I should hit You more often.
BIG	and the oranges.
CARRIE	what?
BIG	-The oranges have to go. This is something I don't like about you.
BIG	I hate That You eat oranges in my bed.
CARRIE	You do?
BIG	They're sticky and they make the sheets stink.
CARRIE	-That's it?
BIG	I like my sheets.
CARRIE	What are you gonna give me for the oranges?
BIG	a negotiation?
CARRIE	Yep.
BIG	this Could take a while.
CARRIE	It could.
BIG	It looks like I may have to spend the night.
CARRIE	"That night, for the first time, Big spent the night at my place."
CARRIE	I realized that neither of us would ever fundamentally change...
CARRIE	...but we were talking about it.
CARRIE	And maybe that was the biggest change of all.
BIG	The next day my sheets stunk of cigars. I changed them immediately.
CARRIE	"Across town, it was 2:00 a.m. and Miranda was no closer to getting sleep."
IRANDA	Hello.
STEVE	-Hey!
IRANDA	Hi.
STEVE	Sorry to wake you.
IRANDA	"It's okay, I was awake."
STEVE	"Look, I don't wanna bug you. Do me a favor. Go to the window."
IRANDA	Okay.
STEVE	Now look up.
IRANDA	Oh my God.
STEVE	"It's amazing, isn't it? It's a blue moon. It's really rare. I just wanted you to see it."
CARRIE	"It was right then, that Miranda finally slowed down and gave into Steve."
IRANDA	"Come over when you're done, okay?"
STEVE	Yeah.
IRANDA	Night.
CARRIE	"That night, Miranda and Steve made love."
CARRIE	And they did it again in the morning.
CARRIE	Miranda was an hour late for work and didn't even notice.
CARRIE	So maybe you can't change a man...
CARRIE	"...but once in a blue moon, you can change a woman."
CARRIE	"Here are some things I love about New York: That week in spring when it's warm, but not hot and the trees are just beginning to bloom."
CARRIE	Men in suits.
CARRIE	Three papers and 12 gossip columns.
CARRIE	"It's easy for me to say, ""I love you, New York."
CARRIE	""" It's not so easy to say, ""I love you, Mr."
CARRIE	Big.
CARRIE	""" The first time I realized I actually loved Big was over toast and coffee one morning."
BIG	What?
BIG	"Thanks, honey."
BIG	What?
CARRIE	Nothing. The first time I felt like saying it was the night he took me to the ballet.
CARRIE	And he hates the ballet.
BIG	I don't want to disappoint you.
BIG	A couple of those dancers were on wires.
CARRIE	They were not.
BIG	On a couple of those big leaps I saw the wires.
CARRIE	You know what? What? I love your hair like that.
BIG	Cut it out.
CARRIE	And then there was the time I never expected to say it.
CARRIE	Last Friday night at approximately 7:20 p.
CARRIE	M Big was picking me up to take me out to dinner.
CARRIE	I just have to change my shoes.
BIG	"Hurry, we don't want to be late."
CARRIE	"If we grab a cab on Madison, we can be there in five minutes."
BIG	Here.
CARRIE	What's this for?
BIG	I just saw it and thought of you.
CARRIE	It was just wrong.
CARRIE	It was wrong.
CARRIE	I didn't know what to say except: I love you.
SAMANTHA	"You told Big, ""I love you"", because he gave you that?"
IRANDA	I think my mother has one in the shape of a squirrel.
SAMANTHA	"What did you think it was, a large diamond duck ring?"
CARRIE	"Note that I did not say, ""I love the purse."
CHARLOTTE	""" What did he say?"
CARRIE	He just sort of reacted stunned for a moment and then he said:
BIG	You're welcome. I'll just wait for you outside.
CHARLOTTE	"Maybe he thought you said, ""I love it."
CARRIE	""" It was a very deliberate and distinct ""you."
IRANDA	""" He just pretended you didn't say it?"
CARRIE	"Yeah, but we both know I did. I've laid down the gauntlet."
CARRIE	"He has to say ""I love you"" back or I have to break up with him."
CHARLOTTE	How long are you giving him?
CARRIE	"I didn't put an expiration date on it. It's got the shelf life of a dairy product, it'll curdle in a week."
SAMANTHA	It's so interesting.
SAMANTHA	"Tell a man, ""I hate you"", you'll have the best sex of your life."
SAMANTHA	"But tell him, ""I love you"", you'll probably never see him again."
CARRIE	That's very comforting right now.
IRANDA	Wait a minute.
IRANDA	Time out.
IRANDA	Did you ever think that at this very moment the man might be trying to find his way to tell Carrie that he loves her?
CARRIE	"It seemed that Miranda, love's greatest skeptic had recently experienced a romantic epiphany."
GROUP	No.
STEVE BRADY	Grab us a seat outside and I'll meet you out there.
IRANDA	will You let me pay this time?
STEVE BRADY	Your money's no good here.
STEVE BRADY	Grab us a bench.
IRANDA	All right.
STEVE BRADY	how much?
CLERK	-5
CARRIE	She was dating a bartender who worshiped her.
CARRIE	Miranda was so crazy about him in return she let him take her out to dinner.
CARRIE	But only to places she knew he could afford.
STEVE BRADY	"Best slices in the city, don't you think?"
IRANDA	"Saturday, my firm is having its annual dinner thing."
IRANDA	"I was wondering if you think the bar could spare you, you could be my date."
IRANDA	"I warn you, it'll be totally boring."
STEVE BRADY	It's not gonna be boring if I'm there with you.
IRANDA	You probably should wear a suit.
STEVE BRADY	It's gonna be a big fancy affair.
IRANDA	"You do have a suit, right?"
STEVE BRADY	"Sure, I do. It's really nice."
STEVE BRADY	It's gold.
IRANDA	It's gold?
STEVE BRADY	"Yeah, corduroy. What's wrong with corduroy?"
IRANDA	I don't have enough time to tell you what's wrong with corduroy.
CARRIE	"For the first time, Steve took Miranda back to his place."
IRANDA	This is your apartment.
STEVE BRADY	You like?
IRANDA	It's sweet.
STEVE BRADY	I modeled it after DeNiro's place in Taxi Driver.
STEVE BRADY	I'm kidding.
STEVE BRADY	It's cheap and it's near the bar.
STEVE BRADY	You never have to come here again.
CARRIE	That evening Miranda experienced her first pangs of yuppie guilt.
CHARLOTTE	A lot of wonderful artists worked as bartenders for years.
CHARLOTTE	It doesn't mean he won't make money some day.
IRANDA	"He's not an artist, slash, bartender."
IRANDA	"He's just happy being a bartender, period."
IRANDA	No aspirations beyond shaking cocktails and refilling peanut bowls.
SAMANTHA	How's he in bed?
IRANDA	There are no words.
SAMANTHA	Sounds like a dream relationship to me.
CARRIE	"He can make you cum, then make you a Cosmopolitan."
CHARLOTTE	How can you get serious with a guy whose entire future is based on tips?
CARRIE	Wait a minute. Rich men date not-so-rich women all the time.
CARRIE	Look at me and Big.
CARRIE	"It's not about money, it's about compatibility."
CHARLOTTE	It's normal for the guy to have more money.
SAMANTHA	I know lots of women who make more money than their husbands.
IRANDA	You're all missing my point.
IRANDA	None of this matters to me.
IRANDA	I don't want it to matter to him.
IRANDA	"When single men have money, it's to their advantage."
IRANDA	"If a single woman has money, it's a problem to be dealt with."
IRANDA	It's ridiculous.
IRANDA	"I want to enjoy my success, not apologize for it."
SAMANTHA	"Bravo, honey."
CHARLOTTE	You're talking about more than a difference in income.
CHARLOTTE	You're talking about a difference in background and education.
CHARLOTTE	This guy is working class.
IRANDA	Working class?
CHARLOTTE	Yeah
CARRIE	"It's the Millennium, sweetie. We don't say ""working class"" anymore."
CHARLOTTE	You're trying to pretend we live in a classless society and we don't.
CARRIE	"Okay Marie-Antoinette, we get the picture."
CARRIE	Thank you.
SAMANTHA	She's right.
SAMANTHA	I'm dating a guy right now and he's got an actual servant.
CARRIE	It seems that Samantha was dating Harvey Terkel a real estate investor who had just made a killing in the market turning Chelsea sweatshops into luxury co-ops for the upwardly trendy.
HARVEY TERKELL	Sum is a fantastic cook.
HARVEY TERKELL	You won't eat better Thai food in Bangkok.
SUM	"More, Mr. Harvey?"
HARVEY TERKELL	"Yes, please."
SUM	"You like spicy like Mr. Harvey, miss?"
SAMANTHA	I love spicy.
SUM	Enjoy.
HARVEY TERKELL	Isn't she the best? I could not live without her.
CARRIE	"I wondered, was New York really any different from New Delhi? Had our class system been replaced by a caste system? And if so, can we date outside our caste? That night, Big took me out for a romantic dinner."
CARRIE	I could smell it coming the way you can smell a thunderstorm right before it hits.
CARRIE	"A mere two days after I had said, ""I love you"" Big had found his own way to say ""I love you"" to me."
BIG	You're gonna love this.
BIG	It's from a small winery in the heart of Tuscany.
CARRIE	Delicioso.
BIG	I rented a villa there one summer with the ex.
BIG	It was incredible.
BIG	I've always wanted to go back with someone I actually liked.
BIG	"There's something I've been meaning to tell you ever since the night I gave you the purse: You can take it back, if you don't like it."
CARRIE	"That became the first night I wanted to tell Big ""I hate you""."
CARRIE	"The next afternoon, Charlotte made the acquaintance of a member of the very highest caste."
CARRIE	"A caste that from coast to coast, rich and poor everyone deferred to and honored without question the movie star."
CHARLOTTE	I'm Charlotte York.
CHARLOTTE	I'm the director of the gallery.
WILEY FORD	Wiley Ford.
CHARLOTTE	I know.
WILEY FORD	How much for this piece?
CHARLOTTE	"The fire extinguisher? No no no That's a real fire extinguisher. For the gallery, in case there's a fire."
WILEY FORD	I guess I'm a total idiot.
CHARLOTTE	"No, it happens all the time."
CHARLOTTE	You can have it.
CHARLOTTE	Take it.
CHARLOTTE	You can say you got it at the gallery.
CHARLOTTE	People will probably think it's a Jeff Koons.
WILEY FORD	You are adorable.
WILEY FORD	"What do you think about closing up for the rest of the afternoon? Charlene, you are so hot."
WILEY FORD	Can't wait to get you to bed.
CHARLOTTE	Charlotte.
CHARLOTTE	My name is Charlotte.
WILEY FORD	I prefer Charlene.
CHARLOTTE	Okay.
WILEY FORD	This champagne is running through me.
WILEY FORD	"Yo, bud, pull over, I need to take a leak."
WILEY FORD	"Sit tight, beautiful."
CHARLOTTE	You'll never believe where I am.
CHARLOTTE	I'm in the back of a limo about to go have sex with Wiley Ford.
CARRIE	Where is he now?
CHARLOTTE	"He's taking a leak out in the alley, isn't that cute?"
CARRIE	"It's adorable. Charlotte, listen to me, get out of there immediately."
CHARLOTTE	All my rules just went right out the window.
CHARLOTTE	"It's like, he wants me and I have to obey."
CHARLOTTE	"He's zipping up, gotta go."
CARRIE	While Charlotte began to enjoy the perks of celebrity Samantha discovered Harvey Terkel came with some nice perks of his own.
HARVEY TERKELL	Stay in bed as long as you want.
HARVEY TERKELL	Sum will make you breakfast.
SAMANTHA	That's really not necessary.
HARVEY TERKELL	"Please, she loves it."
HARVEY TERKELL	Do you like fresh orange or grapefruit?
SAMANTHA	Orange.
HARVEY TERKELL	Orange.
HARVEY TERKELL	Eggs?
SAMANTHA	Coddled.
HARVEY TERKELL	Coddled. Coming Right up.
HARVEY TERKELL	I'll call you.
CARRIE	While Samantha didn't believe in having servants she had no problem dating a man who did.
CARRIE	"She knew it might take some adjusting, but she could get used to it."
HARVEY TERKELL	"Bye, Sum."
HARVEY TERKELL	Take good care of Samantha.
SUM	"Bye, Mr."
SUM	Harvey.
SUM	"Okay, lazy bones, out of bed."
SAMANTHA	Excuse me?
SUM	"up, must wash sheets."
SAMANTHA	Should I have my breakfast in the dining room Breakfast?
SUM	I got no time to make breakfast. Got a lot of work to do around here.
CARRIE	It was then Samantha realized that Sum was not so servile after all.
CARRIE	"That afternoon during her lunch break, Miranda took Steve shopping."
IRANDA	Thank you.
SALESMAN	You're welcome.
IRANDA	What do you think?
STEVE BRADY	I think it's frightening how good I look.
IRANDA	It's a beautiful suit.
IRANDA	I think we should take it.
IRANDA	Could you do a cuff with a nice break?
SALESMAN	will these be the shoes?
IRANDA	I think we should take the shoes. Don't you think so?
STEVE BRADY	I guess we're taking the shoes.
IRANDA	Just like that.
STEVE BRADY	"Jesus, $1,800."
STEVE BRADY	I guess I better not spill anything.
IRANDA	Don't worry.
IRANDA	It's my treat.
STEVE BRADY	What?
IRANDA	"I invited you, I want to pay for the suit."
STEVE BRADY	"No way, you're not buying me a suit."
IRANDA	I wanted to do this for you.
STEVE BRADY	Then I start to think of you like my mother and that can get a little weird for me.
SALESMAN	"Sorry, sir, it was declined. Would you like to try another one?"
IRANDA	Why don't you try mine?
STEVE BRADY	"How about this? Let's try $800 on the card, I'll write a check for $1,000 and the rest in cash."
IRANDA	Forget it. It's too expensive.
STEVE BRADY	Would you just let me buy the fucking suit?
CARRIE	"That Saturday, Big took me to a cocktail party at the home of Sarina Bush Great purse, fabulous."
SERENA	Careful! White rugs.
CARRIE	an Upper East Side hostess famous for her husband's money and a close friendship with Tina Brown.
CARRIE	I knew her 10 years ago when she was famous for her father's money and a close friendship with her drug dealer.
CARRIE	"God, I hate Park Avenue."
CARRIE	It's like being in a foreign country.
BIG	"Just think of me as your passport, baby."
CARRIE	"As we walked through the room of women clutching their bejeweled swan, kitten and asparagus purses I realized to my horror that not only did Big not love me he had absolutely no idea who I was."
COCKTAIL WAITER	can I get You a drink?
BIG	"Tanqueray and tonic. Carrie, a drink?"
CARRIE	"Red wine, please."
COCKTAIL WAITER	"I'm sorry, Ms."
COCKTAIL WAITER	Bush doesn't serve any brown food or drink.
COCKTAIL WAITER	Can I get you something clear?
CARRIE	Vodka on the rocks. No brown food? I think we've encountered a mutant strain of Upper East Side anal.
BIG	She's a little strange.
BIG	"I've known her for years, she's okay."
CARRIE	I'm sure she's fabulous until you spill something.
CARRIE	It's like she's trying to cultivate an eccentricity so people won't notice she's completely devoid of personality.
BIG	Don't be a bitch.
CARRIE	"I'm not, I'm being myself."
BIG	You're being a bit of a bitch.
SERENA	Sweetheart! How are you? It's been forever.
BIG	Thank you for having us.
BIG	"Sarina, you know Carrie."
SERENA	Yes
CARRIE	Hey
SERENA	"Darling, you can't smoke in here."
SERENA	Terrace.
CARRIE	That's where I'll be.
CARRIE	"Just like that, I was cast out of the fancy party."
CARRIE	That same evening Charlotte found herself the newest member of Wiley Ford's entourage.
CHARLOTTE	When did marijuana become legal in restaurants?
WILEY FORD	It didn't. Here.
CHARLOTTE	"No, Thank you."
CHARLOTTE	I don't smoke pot.
WILEY FORD	You do now.
SAMANTHA	Sum was very rude to me the other morning.
SAMANTHA	She practically threw me out of bed.
HARVEY TERKELL	You must've misunderstood.
HARVEY TERKELL	Her English isn't really that good.
SUM	"More asparagus, Miss?"
CARRIE	"It was then Samantha realized she wasn 't so dim, that Sum."
CARRIE	"That night, I realized that relationships had a caste system of their own."
CARRIE	"There's the person who says, ""I love you."
CARRIE	""" And there's the person who never responds."
JEREMIAH	Carrie
CARRIE	"Jeremiah, What are you doing here?"
JEREMIAH	Purveying the beverages.
JEREMIAH	Just snuck out here to smoke.
CARRIE	Good.
JEREMIAH	Are you friends with these people?
CARRIE	"God, no."
JEREMIAH	A little uptight. What's with the no brown food deal?
CARRIE	"Whatever. Jeremiah was a famous downtown performance artist who was best known uptown as: ""Kid, give me another scotch and soda."
CARRIE	""" We had engaged in a mild flirtation for years."
JEREMIAH	Who're you here with?
CARRIE	Some guy.
JEREMIAH	"I got a new tattoo, want to see it?"
CARRIE	is That real?
JEREMIAH	"Yeah, it's real."
CARRIE	How far down does that go?
JEREMIAH	Pretty far. Check it out.
CARRIE	Holy Moley
JEREMIAH	Shit.
SERENA	Excuse me.
CARRIE	Shit.
BIG	Were you really giving the caterer a blow job?
CARRIE	"First of all, he's not a caterer. He's a well-known performance artist."
BIG	That didn't answer my question.
CARRIE	Because it was offensive.
BIG	"Whatever you were doing, please stop."
BIG	You're embarrassing me.
CARRIE	I'm embarrassing you? If you'd joined me on the terrace like a gentleman we wouldn't be having this conversation.
BIG	Let's just go.
CARRIE	"You go, I'm having a good time."
CARRIE	"And across town, Miranda was late for the firm dinner."
IRANDA	Why are you dressed like that?
STEVE BRADY	"I returned the suit. Frankly, I couldn't afford it."
IRANDA	Then why didn't you let me pay for it?
STEVE BRADY	"Miranda, you need to be with a guy who's more on your level. Being in that store with you I didn't feel good about myself."
STEVE BRADY	I think you're an incredible lady.
IRANDA	You want to break up with me over a suit? Fuck the suit.
STEVE BRADY	It's not just the suit.
STEVE BRADY	There's always gonna be things out of my reach.
IRANDA	I'm being punished for being successful.
STEVE BRADY	That's not how I mean it.
IRANDA	Got it.
IRANDA	Thanks for the info and for standing me up.
IRANDA	It's been nice knowing you.
CARRIE	"An hour later, adrift in a sea of Italian wool crepe Miranda wondered what was really so wrong with corduroy, anyway."
CARRIE	"In the space of one evening, Charlotte had gone from girlfriend to groupie."
CHARLOTTE	Who had the rum and coke?
WILEY FORD	"Listen, Charlene. I want you to do something for me."
WILEY FORD	I want you to go to the ladies' room stick your finger in your pussy come back and let me smell it.
CHARLOTTE	I don't think so.
CARRIE	"Charlotte realized, another moment at the top and she would have become an Untouchable."
CARRIE	"""Jeremiah was a bullfrog ""Was a good friend of mine ""I never understood a single word he said ""But I helped him drink his wine"" After Jeremiah got fired, we celebrated downtown with a couple of pitchers of Margaritas."
BOTH	"""Joy to the world ""All the boys and girls ""Joy to the ""Joy to the fishes in the deep blue"" I don't live here."
CARRIE	"""Joy to you and me"" That was the last thing I remembered that night. ""If I were the king of the world"""
HARVEY TERKELL	You just relax.
SAMANTHA	I will.
HARVEY TERKELL	I'm gonna go grab a shower.
SAMANTHA	Excuse me.
SUM	Nasty.
SUM	Nasty girl.
SUM	You dirty cock-sucking whore.
SUM	Must wash sheets right away.
SAMANTHA	Stop it! Let go.
SAMANTHA	You're crazy.
HARVEY TERKELL	What's going on out here?
SUM	"I'm so sorry. I just tried to wash the sheets, but that lady hit me."
HARVEY TERKELL	How dare you treat Sum that way.
SAMANTHA	let me explain.
HARVEY TERKELL	No! There's no explanation.
HARVEY TERKELL	Just get out of here.
CARRIE	Samantha realized there was only room for one woman in Harvey's life.
CARRIE	Jesus.
BIG	Listen I know what you're really pissed off about.
BIG	It's just something I gotta do in my own time.
BIG	Okay? I fucking love you.
BIG	All right? You know I do.
JEREMIAH	Good morning.
BIG	It's just a tough thing for me to say because it always seems to get me in trouble when I say it. Okay?
CARRIE	Okay.
BIG	Are we okay?
CARRIE	"We're great. I love you, too."
CARRIE	"I'll call you later, okay? Did we?"
JEREMIAH	Definitely not.
CARRIE	I didn't think so.
CARRIE	I felt like I was the lowest of the low.
CARRIE	I never told Mr.
CARRIE	Big.
CARRIE	"I figured everything before ""I love you""just doesn't count."
CARRIE	There is nothing more humiliating for a woman than a visit to the gynecologist
DR. FINCH	Do you need more OrthoNovum?
CARRIE	unless it's having to tell your gynecologist you don 't need the pill anymore.
IRANDA	"Actually, I'm going off it."
DR. FINCH	are You trying to have a baby?
IRANDA	"No! I sort of jumped the gun going on it in the first place because Steve the guy that I went on it for, the first real relationship I've had in years, is over and I don't need a daily reminder that I'm not having sex. So that's the story with the pill."
IRANDA	"Okay, I'm quiet now."
CARRIE	Just when Miranda thought she'd hit rock bottom she discovered a new geological layer of humiliation.
DR. FINCH	We got your tests back and everything looks fine.
IRANDA	Great!
DR. FINCH	Just one small thing. It appears you have a lazy ovary.
IRANDA	A lazy ovary?
DR. FINCH	Your right ovary has stopped producing eggs.
IRANDA	Is it possible it's just on strike? I know what this is.
IRANDA	My right ovary has given up hope that I will ever get married and have kids.
IRANDA	It's like a case you know will settle out of court.
IRANDA	Why bother?
CARRIE	the left one Still believes.
IRANDA	I'm a biological underachiever.
IRANDA	It's ironic because that ovary went to Harvard.
CHARLOTTE	I have a tilted uterus.
IRANDA	So.
CHARLOTTE	The sperm have to jump over that hurdle to get to my egg.
IRANDA	"But once they get there, there will be an egg."
SAMANTHA	I need a new gynecologist.
SAMANTHA	Do you like yours?
IRANDA	Not right now. No.
SAMANTHA	At least she's a woman.
SAMANTHA	"I tried to go to a man, but it was too strange him spending all that time down there and leaving without an orgasm, and a bill."
CARRIE	Here.
CARRIE	I'm going to get this.
IRANDA	I don't think these are accepted here.
CARRIE	I'm spending the night at Big's.
SAMANTHA	"My God After all this time, you don't have so much as a drawer there?"
CARRIE	Big is weird about stuff.
IRANDA	All men are.
IRANDA	That's why you have to just stake out some territory.
CARRIE	"Sweetie It's not a land run, it's a relationship."
SAMANTHA	Exactly! Talk to him about it!
CARRIE	"With Big, I think it's best to walk softly and carry a big purse."
CHARLOTTE	"Yes, she shouldn't leave anything there to remain a creature of mystery."
IRANDA	What's the big mystery? He knows she wears underwear.
SAMANTHA	I never leave underwear because I never see it again.
CHARLOTTE	What happens to it?
SAMANTHA	Nothing. I never Go back.
CARRIE	Isn't it a little expensive disposing of lingerie every time you sleep with a guy?
SAMANTHA	That's why I stopped wearing underwear on dates.
IRANDA	That's why I'm never borrowing a dress from you again.
CHARLOTTE	I once found another woman's underwear in a man's bed.
CARRIE	Maybe it was Samantha's!
IRANDA	"Once in Steve's bathroom, I found one of those hair scrunchies from the '80s. I'm not sure what was more disturbing: The fact that he had a girlfriend before or the fact that he dated someone who wore a scrunchie."
CARRIE	Half my music collection was left behind by past boyfriends.
CHARLOTTE	I always Give That stuff back.
CARRIE	I don't.
CARRIE	I consider it a parting gift.
CARRIE	"""Thanks for playing."
CARRIE	Here's Hootie and the Blowfish.
SAMANTHA	""" They're sexual souvenirs."
IRANDA	"Okay, then I want a T-shirt that says: ""I dated a bartender and all I got was this lousy ovary."
CARRIE	""" The next morning at Big's, I started to think."
CARRIE	If the things we leave behind become the archeological relics of our sexual history I should be able to leave something.
CARRIE	Ancient man left cave drawings to prove they existed.
CARRIE	I left a Hair Pro 1200.
CARRIE	And I didn't stop at that.
CARRIE	Man may have discovered fire but women discovered how to play with it.
CARRIE	Charlotte was making history as well.
CARRIE	"Tired of the Neanderthals she'd been dating she spent her night with a gay friend who catered parties for the gallery: Dessert chef, Stephan Bodean."
CHARLOTTE	I had no idea that Betty Buckley was so talented!
STEPHAN	Please! She is the cat's pajamas.
CHARLOTTE	Why do people say that?
STEPHAN	I have no idea. Maybe because she was in Cats.
STEPHAN	Let's start another one.
STEPHAN	"Like, ""She's the dog's tuxedo."
CHARLOTTE	""" Thank you so much for inviting me."
STEPHAN	"No, please."
STEPHAN	Thank you for accepting my last minute invite.
STEPHAN	My friend Don canceled and we had had tickets forever.
CHARLOTTE	Call me anytime.
CHARLOTTE	It's refreshing to go out with a man I can talk to.
STEPHAN	You want to grab a cappuccino?
CHARLOTTE	"No, I've just got to get on home."
STEPHAN	You're uptown?
CHARLOTTE	"Yeah, and you're"
STEPHAN	Chelsea. I'll hail you a cab.
STEPHAN	Or You Could get one yourself.
CHARLOTTE	It helps to show a little leg.
STEPHAN	"You know, I tried that and nothing."
CHARLOTTE	Thank you.
CHARLOTTE	Goodnight.
STEPHAN	Goodnight.
CARRIE	What happened? What do you think?
CHARLOTTE	I am so confused. Is he gay or is he straight?
CARRIE	"It's not that simple anymore. The real question is: Is he a straight gay man, or is he a gay straight man? The gay straight man was a new strain of heterosexual male spawned in Manhattan as the result of overexposure to fashion exotic cuisine, musical theater and antique furniture."
SAMANTHA	"Hopefully, he's a gay straight man meaning he's straight with great gay qualities."
SAMANTHA	Whereas a straight gay guy is just a gay guy who plays sports and won't fuck you.
IRANDA	He must be a gay straight man because he asked Charlotte out for a second date.
CARRIE	Unless he's a straight gay man in denial.
CHARLOTTE	But Saturday night wasn't even a date.
CHARLOTTE	I didn't wash my hair and I wore my glasses!
SAMANTHA	"Are those recreational, because this drink isn't doing it for me."
IRANDA	They're hormones.
IRANDA	I'm trying to jump-start my ovary.
CHARLOTTE	My mother's taking those for menopause.
IRANDA	"Does she have a tilted uterus, too?"
CARRIE	Isn't anybody going to notice my purse?
CHARLOTTE	Cute! Is it new?
CARRIE	"No, but it is quite small and panty-free."
CHARLOTTE	You left your underwear at Big's.
CARRIE	"No, but I did leave a hair brush, a hair dryer, razors tampons and eye-makeup remover."
IRANDA	Good for you!
CARRIE	And something else.
IRANDA	What?
CARRIE	"For the first time at Big's, I did a number two."
CHARLOTTE	Oh no!
CARRIE	I think it's a good sign that I feel comfortable enough with Big to do a number two.
CHARLOTTE	It is not a good sign! It's the end of romance.
IRANDA	This is a big deal! I went through a relationship never doing that at the guy's place including a weekend in Bermuda where I spent the whole time running to the lobby.
CARRIE	It's tough in New York.
CARRIE	"Small apartments, one bathroom."
CARRIE	You can hear everything.
SAMANTHA	That's why I only date rich men.
SAMANTHA	Money means that there's enough space to distance yourself from the number two.
CHARLOTTE	I have never done a number two at a boyfriend's place.
SAMANTHA	"Honey, you're so uptight, you need to do a number seven."
BARTENDER	"Excuse me, it's from that guy at the end of the bar."
SAMANTHA	"Really? My God, it's Dominic."
CARRIE	Dominic Delmonico was a publishing magnate and the first and only man Samantha really loved.
CARRIE	"He wined and dined her, set the bar for hot sex then dumped her for an Icelandic supermodel named Anka."
CARRIE	"Once, on the cover of Fortune, he'd fallen to tabloid level due to a messy public divorce."
SAMANTHA	I'm just gonna say hello.
IRANDA	After what he did to you?
CHARLOTTE	What did he do?
CARRIE	he broke her heart.
CARRIE	Imagining Samantha with a broken heart was more confusing to Charlotte than a French kiss from a gay man.
SAMANTHA	Ancient history.
SAMANTHA	I'm the one with the power now.
SAMANTHA	I've evolved past him.
BIG	"Hey, beautiful."
CARRIE	"Hiya, handsome."
CARRIE	What's this?
BIG	Just a few things You left at my place.
CARRIE	Thanks.
CARRIE	It's like I had one too many items and I was being kicked out of the relationship express lane.
CARRIE	What is it about Big's apartment? Nothing ever sticks.
CARRIE	It's like Teflon for women.
CARRIE	I meant to leave that stuff at your apartment.
BIG	Why?
CARRIE	"For one thing, I don't wake up looking like this. I actually need stuff to look like this and it would be nice not to have to carry it around all day with me like a nomad."
CARRIE	It's just a few things.
CARRIE	And you can leave stuff here.
BIG	I don't want to leave stuff here.
CARRIE	not a lot Of stuff.
CARRIE	"Just like, you know, if you want to shave in the morning."
BIG	I shave at the gym.
CARRIE	"I don't know, socks."
BIG	You want me to leave socks here?
CARRIE	Never mind what I want. What do you want?
BIG	I don't know. Let's save an hour.
BIG	Why don't you just tell me what I want?
CARRIE	"No, really, in your mind what is the ideal living situation for two people in a relationship?"
BIG	Exactly what we have.
CARRIE	and What is that?
BIG	"I have my place, you have yours. We're together when we want to be, we're apart when we want to be."
CARRIE	like Woody and Mia.
BIG	before Soon -Yi.
CARRIE	Ever since Woody Allen described waving to Mia Farrow across the Park single men in Manhattan had yearned for that kind of separate togetherness.
CARRIE	I felt like the last dinosaur.
CARRIE	Was I the one who needed to adapt? Was my view of a relationship extinct? I couldn 't stop thinking about it.
CARRIE	"This is a city where gay men are so out, they're in where women are so chronically single, ovaries may be the next vestigial organ."
CARRIE	We can have anything delivered anytime.
CARRIE	"We can have our dogs walked, our clothes cleaned, our food cooked."
CARRIE	Who needs a husband when you have a doorman? Are New Yorkers evolving past relationships?
SAMANTHA	"Relationships have declined since women left the cave Iooked around and said, ""This isn't hard."
CARRIE	""" So you don't need a man, but do you still want one?"
SAMANTHA	I want more than one.
CARRIE	I can't decide whether you represent our future or our demise.
SAMANTHA	I am the future! Seeing Dominic reminded me of how needy I was and how far I've come.
SAMANTHA	We're going out Friday night.
CARRIE	He treated you like shit.
CARRIE	Why do You Go out with Him again?
SAMANTHA	because he treated me like shit.
CARRIE	I'm leaning toward demise.
SAMANTHA	It's called revenge.
SAMANTHA	I'm gonna make him want me and right before we do it I'm gonna drop him like he dropped me.
CARRIE	As long as you've got a plan.
SAMANTHA	"not Only a plan, I have a dress."
CARRIE	"Samantha's revenge fantasy, like all her fantasies, was even better live."
DOMINIC	You're more beautiful than ever.
DOMINIC	So successful and I'm getting gray hair and Anka is taking me for everything I've got.
SAMANTHA	I read that she got the sailboat.
DOMINIC	We had good times in that boat.
SAMANTHA	You and Anka?
DOMINIC	You and I. have I mentioned how unbelievable You look in That dress?
CARRIE	Since Stephan hadn't come out Charlotte accepted his invitation to stay in.
CHARLOTTE	That's delicious.
STEPHAN	Grilled Portobello pizzas topped with fresh basil and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.
STEPHAN	It's Martha's recipe.
CHARLOTTE	I love Martha Stewart.
STEPHAN	She's the dog's tuxedo!
CHARLOTTE	"Look, you have the silk placemats I've been eyeing at Bergdorf's."
STEPHAN	You have good taste.
CHARLOTTE	this is my fantasy kitchen.
STEPHAN	This is my fantasy.
STEPHAN	Is that dress Cynthia Rowley?
CARRIE	"Charlotte wanted to be open-minded but Stephan seemed to be making it as hard as possible. Meanwhile, Samantha was making Dominic as hard as possible."
SAMANTHA	So do you want me?
DOMINIC	Do I want you?
CARRIE	This was the moment Samantha had waited years and years for. What was another couple hours?
SAMANTHA	I tried to call you. Were you at Big's?
CARRIE	"No, I was out shopping. My relationship is at a standstill, so instead, I'm evolving my look. How did it go with Dominic?"
CHARLOTTE	I slept with him.
CARRIE	That wasn't part of the plan.
SAMANTHA	It's the new plan.
SAMANTHA	I wanted to remind him what he was missing.
SAMANTHA	I can't believe I thought he was such a great lover.
SAMANTHA	I'm better than him now.
SAMANTHA	Bye.
CARRIE	In order to survive two decades of dating in New York Samantha had become a powerful hybrid: The ego of a man trapped in the body of a woman.
CARRIE	Charlotte feared the opposite was true of Stephan.
CARRIE	"She still needed help classifying her find, so she brought in a team of experts."
CHARLOTTE	"Carrie, Stanford, this is Stephan."
CARRIE	Hi.
STANFORD BLATCH	Ciao!
STEPHAN	You changed your hair.
CARRIE	It's just straightened. Have we met?
STEPHAN	"No, I've seen your column."
STEPHAN	"In that photo, your hair is free flowing and Botticelli-esque."
STEPHAN	It's fabulous either way.
STANFORD BLATCH	"Cannolis and cream puffs and tarts, oh my!"
STEPHAN	I put a little bit of everything. This one's an experiment.
STEPHAN	It's a date tart with pumpkin custard.
CHARLOTTE	This is all for us?
STEPHAN	Sweets for my sweet.
CARRIE	and her freeloading friends.
STANFORD BLATCH	"My nutritionist will kill me, but somebody hand me a fork."
CHARLOTTE	can You join Us?
STEPHAN	I'd love to. I have got to glaze my wedding cake.
STEPHAN	Get back to me on the tart.
STANFORD BLATCH	I find him very attractive.
STANFORD BLATCH	"Which, of course, means he's straight."
STANFORD BLATCH	He's obviously choosing to be straight because he seems to be head over heels about her.
CHARLOTTE	What if he's gay and he doesn't know it yet?
STANFORD BLATCH	"Honey, we are aware. When I was a boy, my father gave me a book about the female body to teach me about sex."
STANFORD BLATCH	"I took one look at it and said, ""No."
CARRIE	""" How is he in bed?"
CHARLOTTE	I don't know. I haven't slept with him yet.
STANFORD BLATCH	Really?
CHARLOTTE	But he wants to.
STANFORD BLATCH	It's so not fair.
STANFORD BLATCH	"All the good ones are straight, even the gay ones."
STANFORD BLATCH	Give me a cannoli.
JOSEPH	are You looking at my forehead?
IRANDA	No!
CARRIE	"That night, Miranda went out with Joseph Adler a labor-relations lawyer who'd been after her since the firm retreat."
IRANDA	The lamb is delicious.
JOSEPH	You can look if you want.
JOSEPH	I've got nothing to hide.
JOSEPH	It's actually starting to fill in.
CARRIE	"She'd refused him twice before, but since she was down to her last ovary Miranda decided she was in no position to eliminate men on the basis of hair plugs."
JOSEPH	"I'm telling you, I was practically bald."
IRANDA	I remember.
JOSEPH	Now I have hair.
JOSEPH	This is a miracle.
JOSEPH	Some more bistee? -
IRANDA	Sure.
JOSEPH	You probably think I'm crazy.
IRANDA	"Actually, I was thinking you seem very happy."
JOSEPH	"The funny thing is, I never thought that I'd be the kind of guy to get plugs."
JOSEPH	But I've learned that you should never say never.
IRANDA	I know what you mean.
IRANDA	There are things that I've considered lately that I never thought I would consider.
JOSEPH	Like what?
IRANDA	do You really want to know?
JOSEPH	Sure.
IRANDA	I recently found out that I have a lazy ovary.
IRANDA	Which is no big deal.
IRANDA	It just means that I only produce an egg every other month.
IRANDA	"I'm not even sure that I want kids, but all of a sudden it hit me that if the other ovary shuts down, I'm out of business."
IRANDA	I've started taking hormones and now I'm actually considering freezing my eggs.
JOSEPH	Freezing your eggs?
IRANDA	Like a fertility savings account. I think it would take the pressure off.
IRANDA	It removes the whole biological clock issue.
JOSEPH	"Yeah, But It raises a lot Of other issues."
IRANDA	such as?
JOSEPH	"Such as, what is all this reproductive technology doing for us? Do we want desperate women having babies at 50? Maybe some people aren't supposed to procreate."
JOSEPH	Maybe this is the world's way of weeding out the weak.
JOSEPH	"If you ask me, this is a ridiculous abuse of science."
JOSEPH	You have now designer sperm and these simulated wombs.
JOSEPH	Here's a good idea.
JOSEPH	Why don't we just eliminate men altogether?
IRANDA	I don't need to be lectured about science by a man who's doing crop rotation on his forehead.
CARRIE	Miranda went off the hormones.
CARRIE	"Not because of what Joseph said, but because she was only 33 she still had her left ovary and she wasn 't ready to settle out of court."
CARRIE	Maybe someday there would be eggs in her freezer.
CARRIE	But not yet.
CARRIE	Meanwhile Charlotte decided to stop trying to figure out her creature of mystery and just enjoy.
CHARLOTTE	Cher?
STEPHAN	I love her! She's such a survivor.
CHARLOTTE	Wait.
CHARLOTTE	I have to ask you something.
CHARLOTTE	Have you ever been with a man?
STEPHAN	No. Have you ever been with a woman?
CHARLOTTE	"I'm sorry, it's just Betty Buckley and Martha Stewart and Cynthia Rowley! Are you gay?"
STEPHAN	"I'm a 35-year-old pastry chef who lives in Chelsea. If I were gay, I would be gay."
STEPHAN	You're the one who doesn't want to make love.
CHARLOTTE	I wouldn't be so sure about that.
CARRIE	"Charlotte was relieved and delighted to discover Stephan was definitely straight, or at least a gay straight man."
CARRIE	"Frankly, after two orgasms, who the hell cares? The next morning, it dawned on Samantha that her desire for revenge was not as strong as her desire for Dominic."
DOMINIC	You're awake.
SAMANTHA	Yes.
DOMINIC	You're so incredibly beautiful.
DOMINIC	I'm gonna miss you.
SAMANTHA	What do You mean?
DOMINIC	Anka and I are giving it another shot. It's mostly financial.
SAMANTHA	You can't do this to me.
DOMINIC	I know.
DOMINIC	I'm sorry.
SAMANTHA	No! I'm supposed to do this to you! I had a plan! This is all wrong!
DOMINIC	I should go.
SAMANTHA	Get out!
DOMINIC	I said I was going.
SAMANTHA	Stop beating me to the punch!
CARRIE	As she watched history repeat itself Samantha realized she couldn 't do what Dominic did because she hadn 't evolved past having feelings.
CARRIE	"In a way, that was nice to know."
CHARLOTTE	good morning.
STEPHAN	"good morning, sleepy."
CHARLOTTE	Something smells amazing!
STEPHAN	It's warm cranberry buttermilk scones and lemon curd.
CHARLOTTE	"If I continue dating you, I'm gonna gain 10 pounds."
STEPHAN	You'll still be gorgeous. You want some tea? -
CHARLOTTE	"Yes, please. What is that noise? -"
STEPHAN	What noise?
CHARLOTTE	It's kind of like a squeaking.
STEPHAN	My God! It's a mouse!
CHARLOTTE	are You sure?
STEPHAN	It's in that glue trap.
CHARLOTTE	Where?
STEPHAN	There.
CHARLOTTE	My God!
STEPHAN	His legs are stuck! -
STEPHAN	Do something! Don't kick it to me!
CHARLOTTE	Get it out! Get it away!
STEPHAN	My God!
CARRIE	At that moment Charlotte realized her masculine side wasn 't evolved enough for a man whose feminine side was as highly evolved as Stephan 's.
CARRIE	I spent the night at Big's for the first time since my stuff was kicked out of the nest.
BIG	where You going?
CARRIE	home.
BIG	No. Nope
CARRIE	It's where my hair dryer is. I may have to dry my hair.
CARRIE	"I'm wearing it straight, in case you didn't notice."
BIG	I noticed.
BIG	But I think it looks pretty amazing right now.
BIG	Bring that gorgeous ass back into bed.
CARRIE	I just have to make sure I didn't leave anything else.
CARRIE	"Suddenly, I realized I didn't have to worry about leaving something behind because I was there."
CARRIE	Okay.
CARRIE	I'll stay a little longer.
CARRIE	But I'm leaving this underwear here.
BIG	Is it clean?
CARRIE	"Okay it was a small step for mankind, but it was a really big step for Big."
CARRIE	New York City restaurants are always looking for the next new angle to grab that elusive and somewhat jaded Manhattan palate.
CARRIE	"Last year, it was ""Fusion-Cajun."
CARRIE	""" Last month, it was ""Mussels from Brussels."
CARRIE	""" And tonight, it's ""S & M."
CARRIE	""" Samantha's PR firm was hired to do the opening party for La Douleur Exquise."
CARRIE	Translation: The Exquisite Pain.
CARRIE	"Of course, we were all invited."
CARRIE	This is what happens when the Mayor shuts down the sex shops.
CARRIE	Pops up in your cuisine.
CARRIE	Stanford!
STANFORD BLATCH	I know where I'm taking Mother for dinner the next time she's in town.
SAMANTHA	Honey!
CHARLOTTE	Excuse me.
SAMANTHA	"Let her through! What are you wearing? The invitation said ""kinky."
CHARLOTTE	""" I kinked my hair."
SAMANTHA	The ladies are inside.
SAMANTHA	Go have fun.
SAMANTHA	Next!
STANFORD BLATCH	"Excuse me, but when did wild sex come back in style?"
CARRIE	I think it was the weekend you spent at the Barneys warehouse sale.
SEXY WAITER	"Three Cosmopolitans, a Diet Coke, and a vodka Martini with a twist."
SAMANTHA	I said olive.
SAMANTHA	"Bad waiter, bad waiter."
IRANDA	What do You tip for that?
SAMANTHA	Anyone else want a whack?
CHARLOTTE	How does he wait on tables dressed like that? It's humiliating.
CARRIE	"The summer I worked at Howard Johnsons, I wore an orange hat."
SAMANTHA	Don't be so judgmental.
SAMANTHA	This is just a sexual expression.
SAMANTHA	All these people have jobs and pay their bills.
SAMANTHA	They're just having fun with fetishes.
SAMANTHA	I wonder what your fetish is?
STANFORD BLATCH	Charlotte has a thing for Crabtree and Evelyn potpourri.
CHARLOTTE	I don't have a fetish! -
SAMANTHA	We all have a fetish. The difference between us and them is: They're putting it out there where everyone can see.
SAMANTHA	I think it's healthy and fabulous.
CARRIE	It was lovely to see you all.
CARRIE	And remember ladies: Whipping on the first date is considered forward.
STANFORD BLATCH	"Sit your ass down, Mistress Carrie."
STANFORD BLATCH	There are drinks present.
CARRIE	No can do.
CARRIE	Big's flying to Paris tomorrow for business and I wanna say goodbye.
SAMANTHA	Why not give him a goodbye he'll never forget?
STANFORD BLATCH	Sacrebleu!
SAMANTHA	"Go get him, girl."
CARRIE	"Laugh, it's a joke."
BIG	"Oh. Wait, wait."
BIG	Not so fast.
BIG	Let me see.
BIG	Baby.
BIG	Baby?
CARRIE	"I wasn't sure if it was the cap, the crop, or me, but it worked. Meanwhile, at a fetish across town, Stanford Blanche had a secret sex life."
CARRIE	"A very active secret sex life on the Internet as ""Rick9Plus."
CARRIE	""" It all started innocently enough as a goof on a lonely Friday night."
CARRIE	But pretty soon he was logging in hours and hours on his favorite website.
CARRIE	It was a comfort to know that others shared his underwear fetish.
CARRIE	"Sometimes as many as 2,000 hits a day."
CARRIE	"No sooner had Rick9Plus entered the chat room that he got a message from his favorite on-screen pal, ""Bigtool4U."
CARRIE	""" Some fetishes can only flourish behind closed doors in the very late night hours on a laptop."
CARRIE	While others are out in the broad daylight where everyone can see them.
CARRIE	"Charlotte, like every other normal woman in Manhattan, had a thing for shoes."
BUSTER	good morning.
CHARLOTTE	good morning.
CHARLOTTE	Beautiful shoes.
BUSTER	Just got those in.
BUSTER	Would You like to try them on?
CHARLOTTE	No. I'm just looking.
CHARLOTTE	I have way too many shoes as it is.
BUSTER	Size seven? Size seven.
CHARLOTTE	You are bad.
CHARLOTTE	I'm just trying them on.
CHARLOTTE	I can't even afford them.
CHARLOTTE	I'm saving for a summershare in the Hamptons.
BUSTER	Beautiful.
BUSTER	Look at that craftsmanship.
CHARLOTTE	I love them. How much?
BUSTER	-400
CHARLOTTE	No.
CHARLOTTE	I can't.
CHARLOTTE	Please take it off before I start to cry.
BUSTER	200
CHARLOTTE	Why?
BUSTER	Shoes were meant to be loved. You're gonna need a beautiful sandal like that in the Hamptons.
CHARLOTTE	Thank you so much.
BUSTER	Buster.
CHARLOTTE	"Thank You, Buster."
CARRIE	While one woman was uptown eyeing her artful new sandal another was downtown eyeing Art of Scandal: The Life and Times of Isabella Stewart Gardner.
CARRIE	Miranda was obsessed with reading historical biographies.
CARRIE	In fact she spent all last weekend in bed with Philip of Spain.
JACK	Morning.
IRANDA	That's very good.
IRANDA	Crazy Horse and Custer: The Parallel Lives of Two American Warriors.
IRANDA	Stephen Ambrose.
IRANDA	Great writer.
JACK	I know.
JACK	I just finished his Meriwether Lewis and Thomas Jefferson: Undaunted Courage.
JACK	Amazing.
IRANDA	I'll pick that up right after I finish F.
IRANDA	D.
IRANDA	R: The New York Years.
JACK	Jack.
IRANDA	Miranda.
CARRIE	And right after Miranda picked up Elizabeth I by Jasper Riley Jack picked up Miranda.
CARRIE	Big and I stayed in bed all morning which gave us just enough time for coffee and some last minute details.
CARRIE	I'm gonna miss you.
BIG	I'll be back in a week and you can sit there and watch as I unpack.
CARRIE	There.
CARRIE	I helped.
CARRIE	"Before I forget, Charlotte wants to do a share in the Hamptons."
CARRIE	Are we thinking about it or should I go in on that? -
BIG	Don't think I can.
CARRIE	"Why, not a big fan of the $40 crab salad?"
BIG	There's a possibility I'm not gonna be here this summer. I may have to move to Paris for work.
BIG	Just for a while.
CARRIE	For how long a while?
BIG	"I don't know. Seven months, maybe a year."
BIG	Nothing's definite.
CARRIE	"Wait! Wait, wait, wait."
CARRIE	How long have you known?
BIG	It's been in the works for a while. I'll know more details after this trip.
CARRIE	When did you plan on telling me?
BIG	When I knew more. Nothing's definite.
BIG	Don't get carried away.
BIG	There's the car.
BIG	"I have to go, or I'll miss the plane."
BIG	We'll figure this all out when I get back.
CARRIE	"I wanted to kill him! He's standing there giving me the ""what's-the-big-problem"" eyes."
CARRIE	"I don't understand, like it's my problem."
CHARLOTTE	Calm down.
CHARLOTTE	There are ways to make this work.
CHARLOTTE	It's seven months.
CHARLOTTE	You can go visit in Paris.
CHARLOTTE	he can come back here.
CARRIE	It's not about that.
CARRIE	It's about the fact that I wasn't even a factor in his decision-making process.
IRANDA	Totally.
SAMANTHA	men do this All the time.
SAMANTHA	"Women walking around thinking ""we."
SAMANTHA	""" And their version of ""we"" is ""me and my dick."
IRANDA	""" Totally."
CARRIE	"Just tell me what's going on! Is that too much to ask? ""Carrie, I'm thinking about going to France for the rest of my life!"" Am I right?"
CHARLOTTE	Totally.
CARRIE	"One minute he's all over me, and the next he's pushing me away."
CARRIE	"And I just cannot believe this is happening, again!"
IRANDA	"Yes, calm down. There'll be no breaking of things."
CARRIE	Why do I keep doing this to myself? I must be a masochist or something.
CARRIE	That's when I first realized it.
CARRIE	I was in an S & M relationship with Mr.
CARRIE	Big.
CARRIE	Excuse me.
CARRIE	"In love relationships, there is a fine line between pleasure and pain."
CARRIE	"In fact, it's a common belief that a relationship without pain is a relationship not worth having."
CARRIE	"To some, pain implies growth."
CARRIE	"But how do we know when the growing pains stop and the ""pain-pains"" take over? Are we masochists or optimists, if we continue to walk that fine line? When it comes to relationships how do you know when enough is enough?"
IRANDA	When you read The Complete War Memoirs of Charles de Gaulle get back to me.
CARRIE	"On Tuesday night, Miranda and Jack had dinner."
CARRIE	In the biography of her life this would go down as the best first date in history.
JACK	This is kind of what I wanted to show you.
JACK	Mark Twain lived here.
JACK	Right around the time he wrote Huck Finn.
IRANDA	Really?
JACK	Come on.
IRANDA	It's private property.
JACK	I know.
JACK	I'm gonna show you his little house.
JACK	"Right there, number 27."
IRANDA	It's cute.
CARRIE	Just when Miranda thought she could read Jack perfectly he opened an entire new chapter.
IRANDA	No.
IRANDA	"Someone might come by, we could get caught."
JACK	I know.
CARRIE	"A chapter entitled: ""I like to have sex in places I can get caught."
CARRIE	""" With my one man out of town in Paris I found time to have drinks with my other man."
STANFORD BLATCH	I need your advice.
STANFORD BLATCH	"But in order to get it, I have to confess something."
STANFORD BLATCH	I'm asking you not to judge me.
CARRIE	Who am I to judge anyone? I had bangs in the 80s.
STANFORD BLATCH	I have cybersex on the Internet.
CARRIE	And this would be the nonjudgment part?
STANFORD BLATCH	My name is Rick9Plus.
CARRIE	"No, you didn't!"
STANFORD BLATCH	Rick9Plus: How sad is that?
CARRIE	"I think it shows a great deal of restraint. You could have been ""Rick11."
STANFORD BLATCH	""" So, I've been chatting with this guy and we have a really great time."
STANFORD BLATCH	But now he wants to meet and I don't know if I should.
CARRIE	Let's figure this out. What do you know about him?
STANFORD BLATCH	His name is Bigtool4U.
CARRIE	My God.
STANFORD BLATCH	"Come on, Carrie."
STANFORD BLATCH	This is serious.
CARRIE	I'm sorry.
CARRIE	"I'm sorry, Rick."
CARRIE	Where does he want to meet you?
STANFORD BLATCH	At an after-hours gay club in the Meatpacking District.
CARRIE	Makes sense.
CARRIE	Tell me why you want to go.
STANFORD BLATCH	He seems hot.
STANFORD BLATCH	It's exciting.
STANFORD BLATCH	I haven't had good sex since before Cats was on Broadway.
CARRIE	I say go.
CARRIE	Have a naughty little adventure.
CARRIE	"Be safe, have fun."
STANFORD BLATCH	What if he disses me? He said he's really great looking and has a really ripped body.
CARRIE	"Well, are you Rick9Plus?"
STANFORD BLATCH	I'm so getting your point.
CARRIE	After Rick9Plus went home I decided I was just drunk enough to call Big.
CARRIE	It's me.
CARRIE	What are you doing?
BIG	I'm in bed. I think it's called sleeping.
CARRIE	"So, you're funny in France?"
BIG	It's 5:30 in the morning. What is it?
CARRIE	I would like to know how you could even think of going to Paris and not even think about discussing it with me. I think about you all the time.
CARRIE	"What's he doing? What's he thinking? But you, no."
CARRIE	When were you planning to tell me? Are you still there?
BIG	Yes.
CARRIE	"Okay, because I think about you all the time."
CARRIE	No.
CARRIE	"Correction, correction."
CARRIE	I think about us all the time.
BIG	Can we get into this another time? I was sleeping.
CARRIE	It's never a good time for you.
CARRIE	"You're always sleeping, or you're going You're always going, ""Taxi!"" Then you're on a plane to France for maybe a year."
CARRIE	You're a freaking old man.
CARRIE	You should be thinking about somebody else.
CARRIE	This is not fake us.
CARRIE	This is real.
CARRIE	"Even if you don't know it, it is."
CARRIE	I am a woman.
CARRIE	A wo-man!
BIG	"Have another cocktail, Woman."
CARRIE	This isn't about cocktails.
CARRIE	This is about basic human decency.
CARRIE	This is about taking responsibility.
CARRIE	It's about being a grown-up.
CARRIE	It's about being a man.
BIG	I am a man.
BIG	I'm a tired man.
BIG	It's 5:30 in the morning here.
CARRIE	"You better get used to it because if you move, this is how our relationship will be."
CARRIE	You'll be sleeping when I'm eating and I'll be sleeping when - Shit.
CARRIE	Shit.
CARRIE	Are you still there?
BIG	I'm going to bed. I have an important meeting at 9:00.
CARRIE	"Fine, hang up."
CARRIE	"Don't call me when I'm sleeping because I have a job here too, you know."
CARRIE	Shit.
CARRIE	"Even through my Cosmopolitan haze, I knew I had gone too far."
JACK	Take off your panties.
IRANDA	What?
JACK	I want to give you head.
IRANDA	In the cab? You're not serious? The driver is right there.
IRANDA	Yes.
IRANDA	Yes! Take Ninth Avenue.
CARRIE	"A few days later on the way home, Charlotte couldn't help but notice a gorgeous pair of Italian slingbacks in the window."
CHARLOTTE	I just came in to look.
BUSTER	You have a very high arch.
BUSTER	are You a dancer?
CHARLOTTE	no.
BUSTER	Such well-formed feet.
CHARLOTTE	I was in Miss Debbie's Twirlers when I was a little girl.
CHARLOTTE	They are so beautiful.
BUSTER	"For anyone else, $500."
BUSTER	"For you, free."
CHARLOTTE	"What? No, Buster. Why would you do something like that?"
BUSTER	Because these beautiful feet are tired and they need a little rub.
CARRIE	"When a shoe fetish meets a foot fetish, all reason goes out the shop window."
CARRIE	I am way overreacting to this whole France situation.
CARRIE	"I think Charlotte's right, there are ways to work this out."
IRANDA	What made you change your mind?
CARRIE	I completely lost my shit to Big on the phone. And I realized how close this whole thing is to really blowing up.
CARRIE	"Yes, it's painful sometimes, but it's worth it, you know? The guy has to go there for work."
CARRIE	And what is so awful about spending a week here and there with your boyfriend in Paris?
CHARLOTTE	"Nothing, it's so romantic."
IRANDA	"Great, your love life takes you to Paris and I'm fucking in the back of a cab."
CARRIE	That's lovely.
IRANDA	and not Just there.
IRANDA	We've done it in the bathroom at Bond Street.
CHARLOTTE	I just ate there!
IRANDA	The elevator at the Marriott Marquis and a public restroom in Central Park.
CARRIE	"How very ""George Michael"" of you."
IRANDA	"We've actually never done it lying down, or inside, for that matter."
CHARLOTTE	"This is supposed to be a relationship, not Outward Bound."
IRANDA	You've got to get him in a bedroom and find out what's really there.
IRANDA	I'm a little afraid to try.
IRANDA	He likes the threat of getting caught.
IRANDA	What if being with just me isn't enough?
CARRIE	"Excuse me, Miss Charlotte, what is happening south of your ankles? -"
CHARLOTTE	They're new.Do you like them?
CARRIE	I love them! $500?
CHARLOTTE	"No, not that much."
CHARLOTTE	the guy Just kind Of gave me a deal.
CARRIE	how much?
CHARLOTTE	Free.
IRANDA	Why?
CARRIE	And where is he?
CHARLOTTE	He just wanted me to have them. He just really loves it when people love shoes.
CARRIE	"Sweetie, this is New York City, nobody loves anything that much."
CHARLOTTE	"Well, I let him hold my feet."
CHARLOTTE	Just a little.
CARRIE	"The second she said it out loud, she knew what she had to do."
BUSTER	"Hello, again."
CHARLOTTE	I can't keep these shoes you gave me.
BUSTER	Why?
CHARLOTTE	You know why.
BUSTER	"You've already worn them, I can't take them back. Keep them."
CHARLOTTE	"No, thank you!"
BUSTER	Then I'll throw them in the garbage.
CHARLOTTE	"No, they're too beautiful."
CHARLOTTE	"I'd buy them, but I can't afford it."
BUSTER	What about a trade? Six new styles just came in.
BUSTER	I've never seen them on a foot.
CARRIE	Charlotte looked down at the exquisite shoes.
CARRIE	The smell of leather was intoxicating.
CHARLOTTE	All I have to do is try the shoes on?
CARRIE	"Charlotte felt like Cinderella. Cinderella in a dirty, kinky, freaked out, storybook, parallel universe."
BUSTER	Thank you.
CARRIE	Big arrived on the 9:00 p.
CARRIE	m.
CARRIE	Flight.
CARRIE	I was at his door by 10:00 to welcome him home in style.
CARRIE	"Bonjour, voila le French hat, Voila, le French fry."
CARRIE	And it doesn't stop there.
CARRIE	"I have le Big Mac, and le Filet de Fish."
BIG	What is all this?
CARRIE	It's an apology for being le bitch. I've been thinking about this.
CARRIE	We can make this work.
CARRIE	We'll do le phone sex.
CARRIE	"If things get really bad, then I'll move to Paris for a while and write Le Sex in le City."
BIG	That Would be great.
CARRIE	Which one?
BIG	"I don't care. But you'd be moving to Paris for yourself, right? I mean, don't move for me."
CARRIE	Why would I move to Paris if it wasn't for you?
BIG	I'm just saying I don't want you to uproot your life and expect anything.
CARRIE	I am such an idiot! -
BIG	What the fuck?
CARRIE	"I'm running around town in a beret, buying your greasy food and you don't even care if I'm in your life! -"
BIG	Would you calm down?
CARRIE	No! I'm so tired of calming down!
BIG	"Look, I have to be in a relationship where if I have to go to Paris, I have to go to Paris."
CARRIE	"Fine, go to Paris."
CARRIE	Then what happens to us next year when you decide you just have to go to Brazil?
BIG	This isn't about us! This is about work!
CARRIE	This isn't about work. This is about us getting closer and you getting so freaked out that you have to put an ocean between us.
BIG	I don't want to talk about this anymore.
CARRIE	Why is it so hard for you to factor me into your life in any real way?
BIG	I guess old habits die hard.
CARRIE	Maybe I can't do this anymore.
BIG	I understand.
CARRIE	I bet you do.
CARRIE	You said you loved me.
BIG	I do.
CARRIE	Then why does it hurt so fucking much? On the way home I was furious.
CARRIE	"Not with Big, with myself."
CARRIE	I was the real sadist.
CARRIE	"He might be the one with the whip, but I was the one who tied myself up."
CARRIE	Tied myself to a man who was terrified of being tied down.
CARRIE	"And downtown, in the Meatpacking District another terrified man was preparing to face his fears."
LARGE IMPOSING MAN	Take them off.
STANFORD BLATCH	Excuse me?
CARRIE	Stanford panicked. He hadn 't been seen in his underwear by a roomful of men since seventh grade gym class.
LARGE IMPOSING MAN	"What's it gonna be, pal? In or out?"
CARRIE	"So, Rick9Plus undressed. It would have been rude to stand up Bigtool4U."
CARRIE	"To her surprise, Miranda had no trouble getting Jack to agree to make love in his bedroom that night."
JACK	Let's do it in bed.
CARRIE	"Suddenly, her fear of his fetish ended."
CARRIE	Miranda realized that Jack's excitement wasn't about getting caught.
CARRIE	It was about her and she really began to let loose.
CARRIE	Something she'd been unable to do outside.
ELDERLY WOMAN	Jack? Is everything all right?
IRANDA	Who was that?
JACK	It's my mother. My parents are visiting.
ELDERLY WOMAN	Son?
IRANDA	They sound like they're coming in here. Are they coming in here?
CARRIE	"At first, Stanford thought he'd be shunned for lack of the popular six-pack abs. But then"
GORGEOUS YOUNG HUNK	Never seen that kind before.
STANFORD BLATCH	They're French! I bought them in Paris.
GORGEOUS YOUNG HUNK	Turn around.
CARRIE	Stanford Blanche had never felt more special.
GORGEOUS YOUNG HUNK	Nice.
STANFORD BLATCH	Bigtool4U?
GORGEOUS YOUNG HUNK	Excuse me?
STANFORD BLATCH	Another beer for you?
GORGEOUS YOUNG HUNK	Yeah. I'll buy.
CARRIE	Stanford learned that sometimes a brief encounter can be quite fulfilling.
CARRIE	I went to bed at 1:00.
CARRIE	I was still wide-awake at 2:30.
CARRIE	There were no words left.
CARRIE	We'd said them all.
CARRIE	"After we made love, I knew it was over."
CARRIE	Did I ever really love Big or was I addicted to the pain? The exquisite pain of wanting someone so unattainable.
BIG	Hey. What are you doing over there?
CARRIE	Go to Paris. I'm not gonna come.
CARRIE	Let's not pretend we're something we're not.
CARRIE	It's okay.
BIG	Come to bed.
CARRIE	"I wanted to go to him, but I felt like I was tied to the chair."
CARRIE	"Some part of me was holding me back, knowing I had gone too far."
CARRIE	Reached my limit.
CARRIE	"And just like that, I had untied myself from Mr."
CARRIE	Big.
CARRIE	I was free.
CARRIE	But there was nothing exquisite about it.
CARRIE	In a town where everyone's dying to couple up sometimes there's nothing better than being out of a relationship.
CARRIE	You have time to do your laundry freedom to play your favorite bad music really loudly.
CARRIE	But the best part of being out of a relationship: Plenty of time to catch up with your friends.
CARRIE	I feel sorry for Big.
CARRIE	"I really do, because if you think about it I was the best thing that ever happened to him."
CARRIE	"Actually, I pity him."
CARRIE	Because I get to walk away and be me and he has to walk away and stay him.
CARRIE	Who wants to be him when you can be me? I'm smart.
CARRIE	I'm funny.
CARRIE	I was this thing.
CARRIE	I was it.
CARRIE	I was this magic moment.
CARRIE	I was the abracadabra.
CARRIE	"I was totally the ""poof"" in the relationship."
CARRIE	I've got more poof than he could ever have.
CARRIE	"Sometimes, I poof just hailing a cab."
CARRIE	"So, I guess it's better to know now so I can go poof someone else."
CARRIE	"Someone who deserves me and not some screwed up, insecure guy who can't deal with a woman who's got her act together."
CARRIE	"Now, I'm gonna end up deliriously happy and Big is gonna die old and alone and I pity him."
CARRIE	"Really, I pity him."
CARRIE	What?
IRANDA	Who's gonna tell her?
CARRIE	What?
SAMANTHA	"You're obsessed with talking about Big and frankly, we can't take it anymore."
CHARLOTTE	It's out of our league.
CARRIE	is this an intervention?
IRANDA	"Yes, stop her before she obsesses again."
CARRIE	Isn't part of the breaking up process that you get free rein to whine to your friends?
CHARLOTTE	Of course you do.
IRANDA	But maybe you should think about whining to a shrink.
CARRIE	Why should I pay someone when we can talk for free and then get a drink or whatever? I don't need professional help.
CARRIE	I've got you guys.
SAMANTHA	For another ten minutes.
IRANDA	"Then we're cutting you off, cold turkey."
CARRIE	"Hey, I don't need therapy."
CARRIE	I need new friends.
SAMANTHA	"Look, we're as fucked up as you are."
SAMANTHA	It's like the blind leading the blind.
IRANDA	Sometimes it helps to talk to somebody who's objective.
CARRIE	"Okay, I understand why you see a shrink because you're always in your head but I'm fine."
CARRIE	I am functioning.
CARRIE	"Besides, I don't really To be honest, I just don't buy the whole shrink thing."
CHARLOTTE	Neither do I.
CHARLOTTE	My parents believe that any head problem can be solved with physical exercise.
CHARLOTTE	That's why all of us are really good tennis players.
CARRIE	It's a slippery slope.
CARRIE	"First you go once a week, then three times a week and next thing you know you start sentences, ""My shrink says"""
IRANDA	My shrink says that's a very common fear
CARRIE	Therapy is just so self-indulgent.
CARRIE	Ancient man didn't need shrinks to survive.
IRANDA	Ancient man only lived till 30.
CARRIE	Were my friends right? Had I crossed the line from pleasantly neurotic into annoyingly troubled? I decided to seek my own professional help.
STANFORD	How can you not have a shrink? This is Manhattan.
STANFORD	Even the shrinks have shrinks.
CARRIE	"The fact was, Stanford was right."
STANFORD	The therapist was as ubiquitous in Manhattan as pirated cable.
STANFORD	I have three.
CARRIE	You do not.
STANFORD	I do: One when I want to be cuddled one when I want tough love and one for when I just want to look at a really beautiful man.
CARRIE	That's sick.
STANFORD	Which is Why I see the other two.
STANFORD	do You want a name?
CARRIE	"No, Miranda's shrink referred me to one."
CARRIE	Dr.
CARRIE	Ellen Greenfield.
STANFORD	Dr.
STANFORD	"G! My god! She is hot, hot, hot."
STANFORD	Gwyneth Paltrow sees her.
CARRIE	Why does she go to a shrink?
STANFORD	She suffers from high self-esteem.
CARRIE	"While I was contemplating the couch, Miranda was enjoying hers."
CARRIE	"Two nights later, she had another nocturnal rendezvous."
CARRIE	"Soon, Miranda found herself with a nightly playmate."
CARRIE	"A week later, I kept my date with Dr."
CARRIE	"G, celebrity shrink."
DR. G	"So Carrie, tell me why you're here."
CARRIE	"Well, my friends can't handle me anymore."
CARRIE	You're like very expensive foster care.
DR. G	What's bothering them?
CARRIE	They tell me that I talk about my ex-boyfriend too much.
CARRIE	"But that's normal, right, after a break up?"
DR. G	"I don't like the term ""normal."
CARRIE	""" No, of course you don't, because you wouldn't have any patients."
DR. G	"So, tell me about him: The ex."
CARRIE	"You know, I have to be honest."
CARRIE	I'm not sure I really believe in therapy.
CARRIE	"I'm more of a ""solve your own problems"" kind of gal."
CARRIE	Okay.
CARRIE	I don't know.
CARRIE	He was smart.
CARRIE	"He was sexy, just totally screwed up."
CARRIE	"He was playing all these games, and I didn't know the rules."
DR. G	You were playing games.
CARRIE	"No, he was."
CARRIE	I was just along for the ride.
DR. G	What about you? Was this the first time you dated a man who couldn't give you what you wanted?
CARRIE	"Well, that's a little easy, don't you think?"
CARRIE	Okay.
CARRIE	Yeah.
CARRIE	"Maybe I've dated men who were wrong for me, but who hasn't?"
DR. G	The thing they have in common is you.
CARRIE	What's your point?
CARRIE	Maybe You are picking the wrong men.
SAMANTHA	"Well, of course you pick the wrong guys."
SAMANTHA	"Jesus, I could have told you that."
CARRIE	"Frankly, I think I picked the wrong therapist."
CARRIE	She just did not get me at all.
CARRIE	She thought I was a game player.
CHARLOTTE	You have to be.
CHARLOTTE	It's the only way to deal with men.
IRANDA	That's healthy.
IRANDA	Relationships are not about games.
IRANDA	They're about mature and honest communication.
CARRIE	This from a woman who plays peek-a-boo with her neighbor.
CHARLOTTE	Games are empowering.
CHARLOTTE	"If you know what you're doing, you can control the situation."
SAMANTHA	The only place you can control a man is in bed.
SAMANTHA	"If we perpetually gave men blow jobs, we could run the world."
CARRIE	At least our hands would be free to greet dignitaries and stuff.
CHARLOTTE	Sorry.
CHARLOTTE	"I mean, even if you're in a relationship you still have to play games."
CARRIE	Big and I played games.
CARRIE	Look where it got us.
CHARLOTTE	But maybe the game is not really over.
CHARLOTTE	Maybe it's just halftime.
IRANDA	"That kind of delusional thinking is why you should be in therapy, too."
CARRIE	I do not pick the wrong guys.
CARRIE	They pick me.
IRANDA	"So what, you're like a fly strip for dysfunctional men?"
CARRIE	"Yeah, but one of those really pretty floral scented ones."
SAMANTHA	It's slim pickings out there.
SAMANTHA	You can't swing a Fendi purse without knocking over five losers.
SAMANTHA	Where did all the great guys go?
CARRIE	There it was: Happy hour in the valley of lost men.
SAMANTHA	Woah.
IRANDA	I've never seen this many of them rounded up in one space.
CHARLOTTE	What's going on?
CARRIE	It's sports night.
SAMANTHA	It certainly is.
SAMANTHA	"Come on, girls."
SAMANTHA	Let the games begin.
CARRIE	Sports night: Every female's fantasy a room full of captive heterosexual men all looking to be distracted during commercial breaks.
SAMANTHA	I'm getting a contact high from all the testosterone.
CARRIE	We didn't order these.
CARRIE	They're on the house.
CARRIE	It's sports night.
CARRIE	Ladies drink for free.
IRANDA	Forget Disneyland.
IRANDA	This is the happiest place on Earth.
SAMANTHA	"Yes, indeed."
SAMANTHA	If you ladies will excuse me.
SAMANTHA	I'm getting on the bench.
SAMANTHA	Who's winning?
DON	Knicks.
SAMANTHA	is That good?
DON	"You're not a Knicks fan, I take it."
SAMANTHA	Not yet.
DON	I'm Don.
SAMANTHA	Samantha.
CARRIE	Don Seglar was a very successful importer of Mexican handbags.
CARRIE	He was fanatical about two things: Keeping the price of foreign labor down and the Knicks.
DON	Maybe I can teach You a few things.
SAMANTHA	And vice versa!
DON	It's 10 seconds left.
DON	"Pass, you motherfucker! We need to penetrate, drive to the basket."
DON	Get it to Johnson.
DON	He's on fire tonight.
DON	Go L.
DON	J.
DON	", go! Go! Score!"
CARRIE	Which is exactly what Samantha did two hours later.
CARRIE	"When I got home that night, I couldn't get Charlotte's words out of my head."
CARRIE	We spent our childhoods playing games.
CARRIE	"Were they all just primers for the games we played as adults? Were relationships just a big chess match: Strategy moves, countermoves all designed to keep your opponent off balance until you win? Was there such a thing as an honest relationship? Or was it true? Do you have to play games to make a relationship work? I went out with this girl on Saturday night."
DUDE IN SUIT	We had a great time.
DUDE IN SUIT	"I didn't call her again until Thursday, so I didn't seem eager."
LADY IN CARDIGAN	I went out with this guy on Saturday night.
LADY IN CARDIGAN	I thought we had a great time.
LADY IN CARDIGAN	The asshole doesn't call me until Thursday.
LADY IN CARDIGAN	I screened his call and didn't return it until Monday.
LADY IN DRESS	I gave my boyfriend an ultimatum.
LADY IN DRESS	Propose by Christmas or it's over.
LADY IN DRESS	My girlfriends said that was a game.
LADY IN DRESS	I think it was just smart.
LADY IN DRESS	"Besides, if he doesn't come through, I can always secretly get pregnant."
CARRIE	"The next day, I reluctantly showed up for my second appointment with Dr."
CARRIE	G.
CARRIE	I was still a skeptic and I'd already read every New Yorker in the waiting room.
CARRIE	"When you think about it, what was I getting out of this anyway? And then, at five minutes to my last scheduled hour I got my answer."
CARRIE	My third appointment with Dr.
CARRIE	G: I had come a little early to catch up on my reading.
SETH	Hi.
SETH	I'm Seth.
CARRIE	Hi.
CARRIE	Carrie.
SETH	"I thought we could go on playing this coy game, or I could introduce myself."
CARRIE	"Well, I'm glad you did."
CARRIE	Especially since I had worn my new dress for the occasion.
SETH	That New Yorker is from last year.
CARRIE	"Well, this New Yorker is a little behind on her reading."
SETH	"So, how long you been a Dr."
SETH	G convert?
CARRIE	"Not very long, just three sessions."
SETH	I just had my one-year anniversary.
CARRIE	"What'd she give you, a cake or something?"
SETH	A really big bill.
SETH	"Listen, this is gonna sound a little weird."
SETH	Would you have dinner with me sometime?
CARRIE	Sure. I'd like that.
SETH	"call me, All right?"
CARRIE	Okay.
CARRIE	"Maybe it was unethical making a date with Seth Robinson, photographer, in my shrink's waiting room but there was something about him."
DR. G	Come on in.
DR. G	"Well, you're dressed up."
CARRIE	He's a photographer.
SAMANTHA	And you met him at your shrink's?
CARRIE	It wasn't a setup or anything.
CARRIE	"Jeez, what if he's crazy?"
SAMANTHA	It's the crazy ones that have the good pills.
SAMANTHA	"That's it! Go, Marcus! Go!"
CARRIE	"Excuse me, but why is that on and who is Marcus?"
SAMANTHA	"Marcus Camby, Knicks forward."
SAMANTHA	"Now that Ewing is injured, he needs to pull it out."
CARRIE	When did we start caring about basketball?
SAMANTHA	Don is obsessed.
SAMANTHA	I don't get laid unless the Knicks win.
SAMANTHA	Can I just say? They and I have been on a very long losing streak.
CARRIE	That's awful.
SAMANTHA	No kidding.
SAMANTHA	The Knicks are the only ones getting screwed.
SAMANTHA	"Come on, you fuckers!"
CARRIE	Why are you staying with him?
SAMANTHA	"Because the sex, what I can remember, was unbelievable."
SAMANTHA	Yes! They won! I've got to go.
CARRIE	go.
CARRIE	Have sex.
CARRIE	"Go! The next night, Miranda got a pleasant surprise."
CARRIE	Her date thought it was time they moved past peek-a-boo to playing doctor.
CARRIE	"Miranda wanted to play fair, so she gave him a little tit for tat."
CARRIE	"All over town, people were getting lucky."
CARRIE	Seth and I were having a great first date at the coffee shop.
CARRIE	And what about the plant? I know.
SETH	She always has it in a different place.
CARRIE	Maybe it's some sort of Dr.
CARRIE	G psychological test.
SETH	That's it.
SETH	It's Where's Waldo.
CARRIE	Yeah.
CARRIE	And it needs to be watered.
SETH	It's plastic.
CARRIE	are You sure?
SETH	I touched it.
CARRIE	You touched Dr.
CARRIE	G's plant?
SETH	I've been going to her over a year.
SETH	I got bored.
SETH	Then you came along.
CARRIE	"Well, that's sweet."
SETH	"No, it's true."
CARRIE	There was something about him.
CARRIE	I felt like I could talk to him about anything.
CARRIE	And in the spirit of psychological health and not playing games I decided to be honest.
CARRIE	I like you.
SETH	"I like you, too."
CARRIE	"Later that week, Miranda went shopping for dinner."
CARRIE	Shopping quickly devolved into a game of hide and seek.
IRANDA	I thought I'd be an adult here and come over and introduce myself.
IRANDA	Hi.
IRANDA	I'm Miranda.
IRANDA	You know.
IRANA	Across the airshaft.
IRANDA'S NEIGHBOR	"Yeah, right."
IRANDA'S NEIGHBOR	You're the girl who lives above the guy I've been cruising.
CARRIE	Miranda realized she was still playing with an imaginary friend just like she did when she was five.
CARRIE	"The next day, she called her shrink for an emergency session."
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, Sam had decided she would celebrate the end of the basketball season and the return of her sex life by watching the final Knicks game at Don 's."
DON	"Baby! In a minute, baby."
DON	The Mets are playing Chicago.
DON	"Now that basketball is over, I can give them my full attention."
DON	They've been playing lousy ball this year.
CARRIE	The idea of lasting through another sexless season was more than Samantha could take.
CARRIE	"So, she forfeited the game."
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, I was getting plenty of action."
CARRIE	Seth and I had just come back from another amazing date.
CARRIE	You want to come in?
SETH	I think I already am.
SETH	This is great.
SETH	"You have all the classics here: Clue, Parcheesi, and Twister."
SETH	I was the seventh grade Twister champion.
CARRIE	is That a challenge?
SETH	Yeah.
CARRIE	"All right, buddy."
CARRIE	It's go time.
SETH	how are You holding up?
CARRIE	"Feeling good, my friend."
SETH	Left foot yellow.
CARRIE	I guess that one's mine.
SETH	You're in a very compromising position.
CARRIE	I believe I'm in about 20 compromising positions.
CARRIE	I am not gonna lose my concentration.
CARRIE	"In no time it was ""yellow pants off."
CARRIE	So what do you think Dr.
CARRIE	G would have to say about this?
SETH	Very bad. Bad patients.
CARRIE	I have to tell you.
CARRIE	"I'm not really into therapy, I think it's kind of bullshit."
SETH	I'm telling Dr.
SETH	G on you.
CARRIE	"No, no! Cross your heart."
SETH	hope to die.
CARRIE	"So why are you in therapy, seriously?"
SETH	I'm really fucked up about women.
SETH	"After I sleep with them, I completely lose interest."
SETH	What about you? What's your problem?
CARRIE	"I believe in therapy, this moment is called ""the breakthrough."
CARRIE	I pick the wrong men.
CARRIE	"Although she'd made some good points, I stopped seeing Dr."
CARRIE	G immediately.
CARRIE	I couldn't risk the humiliation of running into Seth in the waiting room.
CARRIE	My friends totally understand.
CARRIE	I ran into my friend Skipper on the street the other day.
CARRIE	He was bruised and frantic.
CARRIE	He'd just broken up with another girl.
SKIPPER	I thought everything was going fine.
SKIPPER	That's when they tiptoe up and clobber you.
CARRIE	What did she say she thought was wrong?
SKIPPER'S DATE	"Skipper, you're a very sweet guy."
SKIPPER'S DATE	This isn't about anything you did.
SKIPPER'S DATE	It's just that we're in very different places right now.
SKIPPER'S DATE	We want different things from life.
SKIPPER'S DATE	I need to spend more time alone.
SKIPPER	"So, actually, we want the same thing."
SKIPPER	We both want to spend more time with you.
CARRIE	"Three months before that, it was a dental hygienist named Tiffany."
TIFFANY	"The timing is wrong, that's all."
TIFFANY	You're one of the nicest guys I've ever known.
TIFFANY	I feel like I've reached a time in my life when I need to focus on my career.
TIFFANY	I don't want to feel guilty about that.
SKIPPER	I don't want you to give up your career.
TIFFANY	I know.
TIFFANY	You've been great.
TIFFANY	You really deserve someone who will appreciate you.
TIFFANY	I don't feel like I have anything to give at the moment.
CARRIE	"And last year, it was Miranda."
IRANDA	I feel like I need to spend more time alone.
IRANDA	I've just reached a point in my life where I need to focus on my career.
IRANDA	I don't think that I have anything to give at the moment.
IRANDA	"Skipper, what else can I say?"
SKIPPER	I have such horrible luck with women.
SKIPPER	"I should've seen this coming, but I didn't because they wait for you to get relaxed and get comfortable before they bring the ice pick down between your eyes."
CARRIE	Not all women just the types of women you seem to be attracted to.
SKIPPER	Over and over and over again.
CARRIE	Those ladies don't know what they're missing and missing and missing.
CARRIE	Skipper's pattern was clear to both of us.
CARRIE	He was a sweet guy who was perpetually attracted to women who were looking for jerks.
CARRIE	"Later that night, on a date across town Miranda was repeating a pattern of her own."
CARRIE	She had been dating a lawyer she met when they fought in court.
CARRIE	"A frequent guest on MSBNC, Kevin was not just argumentative he was an anger professional."
KEVIN	I think I gotta revise my opinion that only an idiot would want to go out to a movie these days.
KEVIN	"It was worth the $19, plus $10 in snacks and water just to hear that bus driver behind us explain filmmaking to his wife."
IRANDA	He had some wonderful insights.
IRANDA	"On the bright side, it was an interesting movie, right?"
KEVIN	It was a real Citizen Kane.
IRANDA	The actor who played Carlo was charming.
KEVIN	He looked like he walked into work before the anesthesia wore off from his lobotomy.
IRANDA	"All right, I'll just get us a cab, okay?"
IRANDA	Taxi!
KEVIN	You gotta face uptown to get a cab around here.
IRANDA	I've caught plenty of cabs this way.
KEVIN	In never-never land where people confuse a lack of talent with charm.
KEVIN	"Come on, Gene Shalit, get in the damn cab."
IRANDA	Come on.
KEVIN	"Get in, sore loser."
KEVIN	"Come on, in."
KEVIN	"In, come on."
CARRIE	Miranda hated how he ordered her around and told her what do every place except one.
KEVIN	Put your hands up over your head.
KEVIN	Spread your legs.
IRANDA	The weird thing is when he tells me what to do in life it drives me crazy.
IRANDA	But when he does it during sex it really drives me crazy.
IRANDA	It's totally hot!
CHARLOTTE	That looks like a good spot.
CHARLOTTE	"Everybody, check for park poo."
IRANDA	"Isn't that funny? That what I hate in life, I love in sex?"
SAMANTHA	"So, how about if you limit your contact with him to just sex?"
IRANDA	"That's a nice, healthy relationship."
IRANDA	I'm not ready yet to throw in the towel.
CARRIE	You're just ready to wrap it around his neck.
IRANDA	He's going through a very stressful time waiting to make partner at his firm.
IRANDA	"When that finally works out, I think he'll lighten up."
CARRIE	Or maybe you should face the fact that you're attracted to angry men.
CARRIE	Deviled Eggs?
CARRIE	and You dumped him.
CARRIE	Fits a pattern.
SAMANTHA	I don't have a pattern.
CARRIE	"In math, randomness is considered a pattern."
SAMANTHA	And I'm what they call a prime number.
IRANDA	She's got a very obvious pattern.
CHARLOTTE	I do? What? Tell me!
IRANDA	You wait for a perfect guy to ask you on a perfect date
CARRIE	"And when he does, you project this huge fantasy on him setting up these enormous expectations"
SAMANTHA	Which promptly blow up in your pretty face.
CARRIE	You put all your deviled eggs in one basket.
CHARLOTTE	That's a horrible pattern.
SAMANTHA	"Well, spread it around a little more."
SAMANTHA	Date a few guys at once and then you won't feel so disappointed.
CARRIE	are You asking Charlotte to juggle?
SAMANTHA	It's all about multi-tasking.
SAMANTHA	"None of us can afford to fall into this ""one man at a time"" pattern."
SAMANTHA	Look at how much time you wasted with Big.
CARRIE	But Big was an aberration.
CARRIE	"Next time I meet a handsome, rich, emotionally unavailable 43-year-old man I'll know what to expect."
IRANDA	Will you? Or will you make the same mistake all over again?
CARRIE	"I wondered were we all just victims of conditioned responses? Doomed to repeat the same unconscious relationship patterns? Were we all, in fact, just dating the same person over and over again? I guess I have dated quite a few artists."
"LADY WITH RED HAIR
"	But I don't think they were all the same person.
"LADY WITH RED HAIR
"	"Okay, yes."
"LADY WITH RED HAIR
"	They were all narcissists with commitment phobias and substance abuse issues.
"LADY WITH RED HAIR
"	"But, in my opinion, the painters were very different from the sculptors."
"LADY WITH BLONDE HAIR
"	Handsome waspy assholes who treat me like shit.
AN IN ADIDAS SHIRT	I only date girls with Sony Playstations or breasts.
CARRIE	"That night, Samantha became acquainted with the new neighbors next door."
CARRIE	Though she had never met them she already knew them intimately.
CARRIE	The idea that someone else was having great sex and flaunting it was more than she could bear.
CARRIE	"So she decided, if you can 't join 'em beat it."
CARRIE	It all fit Samantha's pattern to a T having a wall between her and the person she was having sex with.
CARRIE	After a few weeks of not seeing Big I was beginning to fall into some familiar patterns of my own.
CARRIE	Staying out till 3:00 and sleeping till noon.
CARRIE	Ordering takeout from the same greasy Chinese and calling old friends who would always be there for me when I felt restless.
JOHN MCFADDEN	McFadden.
CARRIE	"Hey John, it's Carrie."
JOHN MCFADDEN	"Carrie, hey, how are you? Long time."
CARRIE	I know.
CARRIE	"Listen, I thought if you weren't doing anything you might want to meet for a drink after work."
JOHN MCFADDEN	"Sure, that would be great."
CARRIE	How about sixish?
JOHN MCFADDEN	I could be there at 6:30.
CARRIE	"Perfect, I'll see you then."
CARRIE	"That evening, at 6:30 sharp"
JOHN MCFADDEN	"Wow, it's great to see you."
CARRIE	"You, too."
CARRIE	Come on in.
CARRIE	I was just gonna open a bottle of red.
JOHN MCFADDEN	"Red, yeah, beautiful."
JOHN MCFADDEN	I just gotta be somewhere by 8:30.
CARRIE	"That's okay, I've got dinner plans at 8:00."
JOHN MCFADDEN	Okay.
CARRIE	John was as dependable a pal as a gal could ever hope for.
CARRIE	"Fun, comfortable and easy to be with."
CARRIE	The kind of guy who you could shed all inhibitions and really be yourself around.
CARRIE	"No muss, no fuss."
JOHN MCFADDEN	So how's the going?
CARRIE	Great.
CARRIE	It's great.
CARRIE	How's work with you?
JOHN MCFADDEN	never dull.
CARRIE	How's your younger sister doing? Brother.
JOHN MCFADDEN	Brother.
CARRIE	The one that moved to Phoenix?
JOHN MCFADDEN	Tallahassee.
CARRIE	Right.
CARRIE	So how's he doing down there?
JOHN MCFADDEN	"He's doing great, thanks for asking."
CARRIE	Sure.
CARRIE	And then I realized it.
CARRIE	"I didn't have a relationship pattern, I had a between-relationship pattern."
CARRIE	"I always went back to John after every devastating soul-shattering, gut-wrenching break up."
CARRIE	"He was sweet, handsome, uncomplicated."
CARRIE	A real shot in the arm for my sexual self esteem.
JOHN MCFADDEN	"Thanks for the call, gorgeous."
JOHN MCFADDEN	Sure put a cherry on my sundae.
CARRIE	Why had I been keeping him on the bench all these years? Did I really believe a relationship had to be difficult in order to work? Do you want to have dinner Friday night?
JOHN MCFADDEN	"Dinner? I should check my schedule, but I think I can make it."
CARRIE	Great.
CARRIE	You want to say 8:00?
JOHN MCFADDEN	How about 8:15?
CARRIE	"And just like that, I broke my pattern."
SAMANTHA	"Carrie, you can't date your fuck buddy."
CARRIE	Say it a little louder.
CARRIE	The lady in the last row didn't hear you.
SAMANTHA	You wanna take the only person in your life that's there purely for sex and make him a human being? Why?
CHARLOTTE	"Excuse me, ""fuck buddy""? What is a ""fuck buddy""?"
SAMANTHA	Come on.
CARRIE	"A fuck buddy is a guy you dated once or twice and it didn't go anywhere but the sex is so great, you sort of keep him on call."
SAMANTHA	"He's like ""dial-a-dick."
CHARLOTTE	"You mean you just call this guy up when you're, you know, horny?"
SAMANTHA	Yes.
CHARLOTTE	And he just comes right over?
SAMANTHA	"Well, he's not a slave, sweetheart."
SAMANTHA	He does have a life.
IRANDA	But you don't have to know about it.
CARRIE	And you're guaranteed delivery within Manhattan in six hours or less.
CHARLOTTE	And you guys all have one?
IRANDA	Mine moved to Chicago but now we have phone sex.
CHARLOTTE	What's he doing in Chicago?
OR	I have absolutely no idea.
CARRIE	"A few moments later, emboldened by our conversation and high from too many tantric headstands Charlotte asked a man out for the first time."
ERIC	"Man, that class was tough."
ERIC	I never sweated so much in my entire life.
CHARLOTTE	Would you like to go out to dinner Friday night?
ERIC	Sure.
CARRIE	I wondered if Charlotte can break her pattern and ask out every man in Manhattan why couldn 't I have a deeper relationship with a man I have shallow sex with? Wow.
JOHN MCFADDEN	You're all dressy.
CARRIE	I guess.
CARRIE	Thanks.
CARRIE	I wanted to tell him that he'd never actually seen me in clothes.
CARRIE	"Do you want a glass of wine first, or"
JOHN MCFADDEN	"No, I'm fine, thanks."
CARRIE	"Hey, wait, wait, wait."
CARRIE	I made reservations.
JOHN MCFADDEN	Huh?
CARRIE	At a sushi restaurant.
JOHN MCFADDEN	Cool.
JOHN MCFADDEN	I see.
CARRIE	"No! I mean, God! I mean sushi Japanese food!"
JOHN MCFADDEN	"When you said dinner, you meant dinner."
CARRIE	Yeah.
JOHN MCFADDEN	"It's just that, whenever we've had dinner, we've always, you know."
CARRIE	"Yeah, I know."
CARRIE	I'm just gonna get my purse.
CARRIE	"Like most first dates, we were off to an awkward start."
CARRIE	"The yellow tail sashimi, two pieces of salmon sushi and a spicy tuna hand roll."
CARRIE	Do you like eel?
JOHN MCFADDEN	No way.
JOHN MCFADDEN	"I'll have the chicken teriyaki, well done."
CARRIE	"No, the sushi's so amazing here."
JOHN MCFADDEN	I can't deal with the raw stuff.
CARRIE	Why didn't you say? We could've gone someplace else.
JOHN MCFADDEN	Don't worry about it.
JOHN MCFADDEN	"If I'm hungry, I'll grab a burger after."
CARRIE	Okay.
JOHN MCFADDEN	"Hey, listen, before I forget this is for you."
CARRIE	Thanks.
JOHN MCFADDEN	"What is it? Forty minutes free long distance, continental U."
JOHN MCFADDEN	S.
JOHN MCFADDEN	", no strings attached."
JOHN MCFADDEN	"It's to promote our new 7-7-3 service: Seven days, seven hours, $3 a day."
CARRIE	Thank you.
CARRIE	So you
JOHN MCFADDEN	Think these gimmicks up? Sort of.
JOHN MCFADDEN	"Officially, I sell time."
JOHN MCFADDEN	I get incentive minutes which I can distribute at my own discretion.
CARRIE	"So, if I'm lucky, I might get a whole hour next time?"
JOHN MCFADDEN	I don't think so.
JOHN MCFADDEN	But if you're currently with MCI and switch then you get two free hours.
CARRIE	I was kidding.
JOHN MCFADDEN	"Right, gotcha."
CARRIE	Maybe we should just order some sake?
JOHN MCFADDEN	"Yeah, sure."
JOHN MCFADDEN	"Hey, sake to me!"
CARRIE	We went back to my place for a quickie.
CARRIE	I needed to erase the stagnant memory of the past two hours.
CARRIE	"Was it really possible that someone so stimulating in bed could be so tedious in life? Meanwhile, Samantha was actually beginning to look forward to the company of her new neighbors."
CARRIE	"Every night, like clockwork, right after the end of the 11:00 news Samantha relished her role as the invisible guest vocalist to an unseen band."
CARRIE	"Until one night, she wasn 't so invisible."
CARRIE	"That Saturday, Miranda planned for us all to meet her latest fling for brunch."
CARRIE	"Apparently, he had flung himself elsewhere."
IRANDA	He should be here any minute.
CARRIE	Don't worry about it.
CARRIE	"If it's just us, fine."
SAMANTHA	It's not like we've got anywhere else to go.
CHARLOTTE	I have a date tonight.
SAMANTHA	with whom?
CHARLOTTE	That yoga guy.
CHARLOTTE	I asked him out.
CARRIE	"Wow, I'm impressed."
CHARLOTTE	"Once I broke the ice with him, it was just like riding a bike."
CHARLOTTE	"I have so many dates this week, that I just scheduled two tonight."
IRANDA	You double -booked?
CHARLOTTE	I had to.
CHARLOTTE	One guy is leaving town and I couldn't cancel the other.
CARRIE	How do you conceive pulling this one off?
CHARLOTTE	"Early dinner with bachelor one, late supper with bachelor two."
SAMANTHA	"My God, you're turning into a man."
CARRIE	Charlotte had done more than break a pattern.
CARRIE	She had actually changed genders.
CHARLOTTE	I just don't know how I'm ever gonna eat two dinners in a row.
CARRIE	"And then, just like that, she was a woman again."
KEVIN	"Sorry, babe."
KEVIN	The idiot who drove me here apparently passed his driving test in Bangladesh.
KEVIN	I'm just happy to get off that fuckin' rickshaw alive.
IRANDA	"Kevin, this is Carrie, and Samantha, and Charlotte."
IRANDA	this is Kevin.
KEVIN	Nice to meet you.
KEVIN	"I have to go make a call, I'll be back."
KEVIN	Waitress! A draft beer here.
CHARLOTTE	He's cute.
SAMANTHA	In a tightly wound sort of way.
IRANDA	He's finding out on Tuesday whether he made partner.
IRANDA	I'm keeping my fingers crossed that he'll unwind some after that.
CARRIE	What are you doing?
IRANDA	I just don't want him going off on the waitress.
CARRIE	"That evening, Charlotte set out to break her pattern."
CARRIE	A casual meal with Eric from yoga discovering a mutual love for long drives up Maine coasts and reruns of Nanny and the Professor.
ERIC	"She was psychic, wasn't she?"
CHARLOTTE	Absolutely.
ERIC	"But it was very subtle, very sophisticated."
CHARLOTTE	I don't think that kids today would understand it.
ERIC	"When I have kids, I'm gonna be a total nazi with the remote."
ERIC	I want them to read.
CHARLOTTE	How many kids do you want to have?
ERIC	Two: One of each.
CHARLOTTE	Sounds perfect.
CARRIE	As Charlotte began to swim in visions of family summers in Kennebunkport she realized she was late for the second shift.
CHARLOTTE	Oh my God.
ERIC	What's wrong?
CHARLOTTE	My throat is so sore.
CHARLOTTE	I've just been fighting this cold all week.
ERIC	Let me get the check.
CHARLOTTE	I'm so sorry.
CHARLOTTE	I had a really great time.
ERIC	"Me, too."
CARRIE	While Charlotte was off to her next engagement Samantha was imagining an engagement of her own.
SAMANTHA	"Excuse me, Jesus! Hi, I was just wondering do you know who lives in that apartment? Yes, very nice."
JESUS	"Yes, very nice."
JESUS	Musician.
JESUS	"His wife, a dancer."
SAMANTHA	Really? And are they nice looking?
JESUS	"Yes, very nice."
JESUS	Very good.
SAMANTHA	"Okay, then."
SAMANTHA	Carry on.
CARRIE	"Later that night, Charlotte was returning from a second dinner of steamed mussels and fries with bachelor number two, an art loving commodities broker."
BROKER	I had a really Great time.
CHARLOTTE	"me, too."
CHARLOTTE	Excuse me.
BROKER	"So, can I call you? Definitely."
CHARLOTTE	Okay.
ERIC	Charlotte?
CHARLOTTE	"Eric, what are you doing here?"
ERIC	I was just leaving you some chicken soup for your throat.
ERIC	But I see you've healed.
BROKER	Who is this guy?
ERIC	I'm the guy she had dinner with before you.
BROKER	You double-booked us?
ERIC	"Hey, don't feel bad."
ERIC	You got the late shift.
ERIC	You get to take her upstairs.
BROKER	I don't think so.
ERIC	You know what? Enjoy the soup.
BROKER	"Hey, you going uptown?"
ERIC	"Yeah, West Side."
BROKER	Wanna share a cab? Sure.
CARRIE	"From that moment on, Charlotte developed a new pattern."
CARRIE	She made it a rule never to take advice from her friends again.
CARRIE	Very late that night Samantha decided to roll out the welcome mat for her new neighbors.
CARRIE	The musician and the dancer turned out to be a middle-aged Eastern European couple.
CARRIE	He played in a polka band.
CARRIE	She was a dancer once upon a time.
DANCER	Samantha?
SAMANTHA	Would you mind keeping it down? I'm trying to get some sleep.
CARRIE	Samantha broke a pattern after all.
CARRIE	She decided to move her bed to the opposite wall.
CARRIE	"Later that week, Kevin experienced a dream come true."
CARRIE	He was made a full partner of the law firm where he worked.
CARRIE	He took Miranda out to celebrate.
IRANDA	A toast.
IRANDA	to a very happy occasion.
KEVIN	Yeah.
KEVIN	I'm falling all over myself with glee.
KEVIN	I get to work 60 hours a week for the same salary.
KEVIN	I'm walking on air.
IRANDA	Can't we enjoy your success for one second?
KEVIN	You don't get how stressful my life is.
KEVIN	"You really do live in never-never land, don't you? By the way if there's a difference between this $100 champagne and the crap for $29 it takes a more delicate palate than mine to detect it."
IRANDA	"Well, I like the champagne, and the bread is fabulous."
IRANDA	"Oh my God, look at those flowers."
KEVIN	Don't piss me off.
KEVIN	Where are you going?
IRANDA	Back to never-never land.
IRANDA	"And by the way, never-never call me again."
KEVIN	Have a nice day.
CARRIE	What? Miranda broke her pattern in a way that she had never expected.
CARRIE	The angry guy had turned her into a cock-eyed optimist.
CARRIE	There couldn't have been a more perfect moment to see Skipper for the first time since she dumped him.
IRANDA	"Hey, Skipper! Slow down a minute."
SKIPPER	"Don't tell me what to do, okay?"
IRANDA	I just wanted to say hello.
IRANDA	How've you been?
SKIPPER	How've I been? You got a lot of nerve talking to me like nothing happened ever since you tossed me out like bad milk.
SKIPPER	I've been friggin' great.
SKIPPER	Now that I've got you out of my system.
IRANDA	Can't I just talk to you for a minute? Could I buy you a beer or something?
CARRIE	Miranda had never seen him as angry as this before.
CARRIE	"Much to her horror, she was attracted."
CARRIE	That's the thing about patterns.
CARRIE	They don 't break because you tell them to.
IRANDA	Have you been working out?
CARRIE	"And a few nights later, John and I went out for a movie."
CARRIE	"I refused to believe that a passionate sexual connection could not be translated into a meaningful friendship, at the very least."
CARRIE	Did you like the movie?
JOHN MCFADDEN	Was it a comedy?
CARRIE	no.
JOHN MCFADDEN	I didn't think so.
CARRIE	Isn't this the most amazing block? All these brownstones are over 100 years old.
CARRIE	It's like being in the New York of Edith Wharton and Henry James.
CARRIE	"Sometimes, I can't believe how lucky I am to live right here."
CARRIE	What?
JOHN MCFADDEN	Your tits look great in that thing.
CARRIE	"At that moment, I knew we only had two things in common."
CARRIE	"Listen, I'd invite you in, but"
JOHN MCFADDEN	"No, that's okay."
JOHN MCFADDEN	I got to be up really early tomorrow.
CARRIE	Okay.
JOHN MCFADDEN	I'll call you.
CARRIE	Goodnight.
CARRIE	I knew it was the last time we'd ever see each other.
CARRIE	"Just like that I was thrown right back into my old pattern: Greasy Chinese, sleeping till noon and feeling restless."
CARRIE	Everyone has a worst nightmare.
CARRIE	"For some, it's bathing-suit season."
CARRIE	"For others, it's that your birth certificate can never be legally destroyed."
CARRIE	"For Miranda, it was family hour at her gym."
IRANDA	What the
VOICE ON INTERCOM	"Kiddy Jazzercise, Aerobics Room 1, five minutes."
CARRIE	"On Sundays, her neighborhood became occupied territory under siege to children."
CARRIE	"They were everywhere: Movie theaters, restaurants, bookstores, hair salons Starbucks was basically a stroller parking lot."
CARRIE	Was it too much to hope for one small space to call her own?
ROGER COBB	"Don't touch it, please!"
IRANDA	Is there a problem?
ROGER COBB	"No, it's just that he really likes to push the button."
IRANDA	"Fine, I'm in kind of a rush."
IRANDA	Push One.
ROGER COBB	"Simon, this pretty lady said that you could push the button."
ROGER COBB	So Sorry.
IRANDA	I'm sure it's just a phase.
ROGER COBB	"Yeah, the guilty, overindulgent phase of a D-l-V-O-R-C-E."
SIMON	Daddy.
ROGER COBB	"Simon, we're not being very nice to"
IRANDA	Miranda
ROGER COBB	That sounds like a princess name.
SIMON	Stop talking.
SIMON	I'm going to bite you.
ROGER COBB	do You want to Go to the toy store later?
SIMON	Yes.
ROGER COBB	Then don't bite me.
ROGER COBB	I am in violation of every parenting book ever written.
ROGER COBB	do You have kids?
IRANDA	no.
ROGER COBB	Married?
IRANDA	here we are.
ROGER COBB	at last.
ROGER COBB	Any chance I could persuade you to take another ride?
CARRIE	His name was Roger Cobb.
CARRIE	It only took him another floor and a half to ask Miranda for her phone number.
CARRIE	The whole thing might have been very romantic if Simon hadn 't peed in his pants.
IRANDA	"I don't wear vintage clothes, I hate flea markets, I don't collect antiques."
IRANDA	"Is it too much to ask that he not be, I don't know, used?"
CARRIE	"Before it goes any further, just make sure his parts are still under warranty."
IRANDA	It's like chewing somebody else's gum.
SAMANTHA	Divorced men do come with baggage.
IRANDA	Baggage is one thing.
IRANDA	But when they come with kids
CARRIE	Especially kids with bladder control issues.
SAMANTHA	Here's what I think.
SAMANTHA	Round up all the divorced men and keep them in a pound.
SAMANTHA	"That way, you get their whole history before you take one home."
CHARLOTTE	"If a man is divorced, it doesn't mean he has a problem."
CHARLOTTE	Like my brother Wesley.
CHARLOTTE	"He just separated from his wife, Leslie"
SAMANTHA	Wesley and Leslie? I don't think so.
CARRIE	"What is That, marriage by Mother Goose?"
IRANDA	Definitely a candidate for the pound.
CHARLOTTE	"I was going to ask you to meet him 'cause he's coming to visit, and now forget it."
CARRIE	We want to meet Wesley of Wesley and Leslie.
CARRIE	And p.
CARRIE	s.
CARRIE	", does he work for Nestle?"
CHARLOTTE	My brother's very important to me.
CHARLOTTE	I won't have him subjected to scrutiny and ridicule.
SAMANTHA	I'll be Scrutiny.
SAMANTHA	You be Ridicule.
IRANDA	I always have to be Ridicule.
IRANDA	Why can't you be Ridicule for once? I know.
CARRIE	"As for me, rather than sort through the half-off bin I was dating someone brand-spanking new."
CARRIE	I met Vaughn Weisel at a P.E.N.
CARRIE	Luncheon a month ago.
CARRIE	It's amazing how much better looking fiction writers have become.
CARRIE	Still up for a movie?
VAUGHN WEISEL	I just gotta drop these books by my parent's place.
VAUGHN WEISEL	It's on the way.
VAUGHN WEISEL	GQ called.
CARRIE	they want You to write something?
VAUGHN WEISEL	They want me to wear something.
VAUGHN WEISEL	"It's so great to be a writer these days, there's so little writing involved."
CARRIE	Don't be photographed in anything sleeveless.
CARRIE	No one who went sleeveless ever won a Pulitzer.
CARRIE	It's just a little tip from me to you.
CARRIE	Nice townhouse.
VAUGHN WEISEL	"come on in, this will Only take a second."
CARRIE	I'm not dressed for family.
CARRIE	Can you just drop them through the mail slot?
VAUGHN WEISEL	If I'm here and I don't say hello I'm looking at two months minimum hard family time.
CARRIE	All right.
CARRIE	"Yeah, okay."
CARRIE	Thank you.
ZOIE WEISEL	"Mother, I swear, you are the only person who can kill a cactus. Hey Vaughn."
VAUGHN WEISEL	"Zoie, this is Carrie."
WALLACE WEISEL	Tell your sister to stop bringing me plants.
WALLACE WEISEL	They get suicidal around me.
WALLACE WEISEL	I have to talk them down from the ledge.
VAUGHN WEISEL	those books You asked me to sign
WALLACE WEISEL	"Duncan, Vaughn's here."
ZOIE WEISEL	And he brought a girl! Hi.
WALLACE WEISEL	Wallis Weisel
CARRIE	Hi.
WALLACE WEISEL	have we met?
CARRIE	"No, I don't think so."
CARRIE	Carrie Bradshaw.
WALLACE WEISEL	My God.
WALLACE WEISEL	"Duncan, get your ass in here."
WALLACE WEISEL	I just love your column.
CARRIE	I love to hear that.
VAUGHN WEISEL	"Mom, we can't stay."
WALLACE WEISEL	The hell you can't.
WALLACE WEISEL	You know what you should write about? Re-virginization.
WALLACE WEISEL	Did you know there are women who are actually having their vaginas re-stitched to make them like new again?
CARRIE	Aren't they clever?
VAUGHN WEISEL	"If you're wondering, Mom just finished a documentary on genital mutilation."
WALLACE WEISEL	Which I still haven't gotten your notes on.
VAUGHN WEISEL	"I told you, I can't bring myself to look at that thing."
WALLACE WEISEL	And I typed all his short stories for him when he was 12.
WALLACE WEISEL	"Duncan, look."
WALLACE WEISEL	Do you know who this is? Carrie Bradshaw.
WALLACE WEISEL	she writes That column we love.
DUNCAN WEISEL	What are You doing Thursday night?
CARRIE	Laundry.
DUNCAN WEISEL	I teach a seminar at Columbia on Cultural Zeitgeist.
DUNCAN WEISEL	I'd love to have you come speak.
DUNCAN WEISEL	Mr.
DUNCAN WEISEL	Self-Involved here didn't tell us he was dating an icon.
CARRIE	Icon?
DUNCAN WEISEL	You are an icon.
DUNCAN WEISEL	You are.
FRANNY WEISEL	who brought a girl?
VAUGHN WEISEL	this is my other sister.
VAUGHN WEISEL	"Franny, this is Carrie."
FRANNY WEISEL	What's up?
CARRIE	What's up?
FRANNY WEISEL	"Hey, mom."
WALLACE WEISEL	"Hi, sweetie."
CARRIE	Franny and Zooey?
WALLACE WEISEL	What can I say? J.D.Salinger used to get me high.
DUNCAN WEISEL	And then she'd call me at 3:00 a.m
DUNCAN WEISEL	", ""I love you."
DUNCAN WEISEL	Good for you.
DUNCAN WEISEL	Beautiful and she thinks I'm funny.
WALLACE WEISEL	You're hilarious.
WALLACE WEISEL	Put your tongue back in your head and the lox on the table.
WALLACE WEISEL	"Come on, everybody, let's have something to eat."
VAUGHN WEISEL	we have to go.
WALLACE WEISEL	"come on, please."
CARRIE	We'll stay.
CARRIE	"I mean, really, within the space of five minutes I had next week's column, an invitation to speak at an Ivy League university and access to the entire Zabar's fish counter."
CARRIE	Leave now? Was he nuts?
ROGER COBB	Have you ever gone out with someone who had a kid?
IRANDA	"No, but I've never gone out with someone I met on an elevator either."
ROGER COBB	"That's a first for me, too."
ROGER COBB	"I met a woman on an escalator once, but it didn't last long."
ROGER COBB	It was over by the time we got to Ladies Lingerie.
IRANDA	I dated a man once who wore ladies' lingerie.
IRANDA	That was kind of the problem there.
IRANDA	I'm kidding.
ROGER COBB	'Cause I'm wearing panties now.
IRANDA	"You're kidding, right?"
SIMON	Look what I found.
ROGER COBB	Can you say you're sorry?
SIMON	No!
ROGER COBB	Are you okay?
IRANDA	"Fortunately, I mostly use the right side of my brain."
IRANDA	"It must be hard, having a social life as a single parent."
ROGER COBB	"It is, I got to buy protective helmets for all my dates."
IRANDA	"Where's mine, by the way?"
ROGER COBB	"The truth is, I didn't really have a great social life before Simon either."
ROGER COBB	I'm just one of those weird male aberrations who prefers to be married.
ROGER COBB	I like stability and routine.
ROGER COBB	I like knowing there's people waiting for me at home.
ROGER COBB	I Guess That makes me sound pretty dull.
IRANDA	are You kidding?
IRANDA	You're the Heterosexual Holy Grail.
CARRIE	Miranda wondered how a vintage man might look on her modern couch.
SIMON	here.
IRANDA	Thank you.
ROGER COBB	Probably not the best time to ask you to dinner.
CARRIE	While Miranda was dealing with queasiness Charlotte was handling depression which she felt could be solved with a homemade muffin.
CHARLOTTE	Here you go.
CHARLOTTE	Just like Nana used to make.
WESLEY	"Charlie, the muffins are great, but I'd much prefer a nice dry martini."
CHARLOTTE	But Nana always made muffins to cheer you up.
WESLEY	That was pre-Leslie.
WESLEY	"Post-Leslie, I need a cocktail."
WESLEY	Where's your vodka?
CHARLOTTE	I don't have any.
WESLEY	and You call yourself a Wasp.
CHARLOTTE	"I don't see why you two can't work it out, you had the most beautiful wedding."
WESLEY	We'll have an even lovelier divorce.
CHARLOTTE	I can't believe you're willing to just throw it all away so easily.
CHARLOTTE	Relationships take work.
CHARLOTTE	You need patience and understanding.
WESLEY	When was your last long-term relationship?
CHARLOTTE	Just eat your muffin.
CARRIE	The afternoon had been like six hours of foreplay.
CARRIE	Some men seduce with dim lights and soft music.
CARRIE	Vaughn seduced with chocolate chip cookies and relatives.
CARRIE	It was inevitable this would happen.
CARRIE	I just didn't know it would happen so quickly.
CARRIE	I'll get a tissue.
SAMANTHA	"Get out now, before he stains all your sheets."
IRANDA	"Come on, that's harsh."
IRANDA	It could be he was just nervous.
CARRIE	First time is always weird.
IRANDA	he probably had something to drink.
CARRIE	We'd spent the day with his family.
SAMANTHA	The guy could not get his Cadillac into the garage.
SAMANTHA	"I'm sorry, I hate being right about this."
CARRIE	Samantha was the General Patton of sex.
SAMANTHA	She didn't send her troops into battle if she thought they would lose.
CARRIE	I like him.
SAMANTHA	"That's swell, but it doesn't get the cream in the cupcake."
CARRIE	But the thing I like best about him is his family.
SAMANTHA	Anyone there you can fuck?
SAMANTHA	What? I'm trying to be helpful.
CARRIE	"I'm telling you, this family is like They got charisma."
CARRIE	"Like Tom Cruise, they're the Tom Cruise of families."
IRANDA	I'm sure the family is supposed to be the obstacle to a relationship not the attraction.
SAMANTHA	I fucked a guy once because his family had a pool.
SAMANTHA	"He was pretty much of a nerd, but I'd go over there and get all cocoa-buttered up."
SAMANTHA	His mom loved me.
SAMANTHA	She was always serving me Kool-Aid and chips.
CARRIE	Kool -Aid?
SAMANTHA	"Yeah, Kool-Aid, I was 13."
SAMANTHA	"And honey, you should have seen my tan."
CARRIE	"In my mind, the complications of making a relationship work had just expanded exponentially."
CARRIE	"When you date someone, how many people become emotionally involved? When you sleep with someone, are you screwing the family? While I was still on the fence about Vaughn I had no doubt about my feeling for his mother."
CARRIE	I was in love with her.
WALLACE WEISEL	Then we were in Nicaragua with the Peace Corps.
WALLACE WEISEL	That's where Vaughn was born.
CARRIE	I can't get over it.
CARRIE	You've had five lives.
CARRIE	I can barely make one happen.
WALLACE WEISEL	Don't pull that self-effacing shit with me.
WALLACE WEISEL	I see you.
WALLACE WEISEL	I know what you've got going.
CARRIE	What? What do I do? I write this little column.
WALLACE WEISEL	It's a contribution.
WALLACE WEISEL	You are putting it out there.
WALLACE WEISEL	You're part of a dialogue.
WALLACE WEISEL	If it wasn't for you we wouldn't know half the things we do about other people's sex lives.
CARRIE	Thanks a lot.
WALLACE WEISEL	I'm teasing.
WALLACE WEISEL	"No, it's wonderful to be frank and honest about sex."
WALLACE WEISEL	That's how I raised my kids.
WALLACE WEISEL	Sex was always a part of the discussion.
WALLACE WEISEL	"When they were 2 years old, they knew the proper names for their body parts."
WALLACE WEISEL	"None of this ""pee-pee"" and ""wee-wee"" crap."
WALLACE WEISEL	"And as a result, they can talk to me about anything."
WALLACE WEISEL	"When Franny told me she was a lesbian I said, ""Great, just as long as you're not a Republican."
CARRIE	May I just say I like you very much.
WALLACE WEISEL	"That's dear, thank you."
CHARLOTTE	Did you talk to Leslie today? No.
WESLEY	I talked to her lawyer.
WESLEY	Do you want to know about that? I'm giving her the house and she's giving me an ulcer.
CHARLOTTE	I'm sorry I brought it up.
CHARLOTTE	Tonight we'll have fun.
CHARLOTTE	You'll finally meet my friend Carrie.
CHARLOTTE	"We'll go out, have dinner, maybe go to a club Shit."
CHARLOTTE	"This is my wonderful brother, Wesley."
CARRIE	Nice to meet you.
SAMANTHA	good looks run in the family.
WESLEY	can I get You Ladies a drink?
SAMANTHA	Cosmopolitan.
CARRIE	Ditto.
SAMANTHA	how are You enjoying New York?
CHARLOTTE	Excuse us.
CHARLOTTE	Why is she here?
CARRIE	That's our friend.
CARRIE	I believe you remember Samantha.
CHARLOTTE	You know how she gets.
CHARLOTTE	Look! She's doing it already.
CARRIE	They're talking.
WESLEY	Samantha says there's a great jazz bar that we should go to.
CHARLOTTE	I just don't think I'm up for it tonight.
WESLEY	Then maybe we'll just go.
CARRIE	Talking and going to hear jazz.
IRANDA	I think I have your son's Slinky embedded in my back.
ROGER COBB	I like to brand my women.
IRANDA	"I'm going to use the bathroom, and then I really will go."
SIMON	Daddy?
IRANDA	"No, Simon!"
SIMON	Daddy!
IRANDA	Shit.
IRANDA	I'm sorry.
IRANDA	"I was peeing, and I didn't want him to see me."
IRANDA	I was afraid he'd see me and then he'd be drawing pictures for a child psychologist and nobody's happy.
IRANDA	I'll get a Band-Aid.
ROGER COBB	He's hurt.
ROGER COBB	He might need a stitch.
IRANDA	I'll go with you to the emergency room.
SIMON	No!
ROGER COBB	Just go.
ROGER COBB	"Please, just go."
CARRIE	"One thing about families if no one's sorry to see you go, then you're probably not coming back."
CARRIE	"The next morning, Charlotte was in for a rude awakening."
SAMANTHA	Where do you keep your coffee filters? Just tell me if I'm warm.
CHARLOTTE	My brother? You slept with my brother?
SAMANTHA	"Honey, what a doll."
SAMANTHA	He really
CHARLOTTE	"Is your vagina in the New York City guidebooks? It should be, it's the hottest spot in town! It's always open!"
WESLEY	What's going on? What did you say?
CHARLOTTE	"She was in my kitchen, she was wearing your shirt, I snapped."
WESLEY	"Who asked you to butt your nose into my Samantha, wait! Don't go!"
CARRIE	I didn't know your mom was nominated for an Oscar.
VAUGHN WEISEL	Best Documentary Short.
CARRIE	I just love that she still has so many ambitions for herself.
VAUGHN WEISEL	I'm not really in the mood to talk about my mom.
VAUGHN WEISEL	I'm not really in the mood to talk at all.
VAUGHN WEISEL	Don't touch it!
CARRIE	What was the documentary short about anyway?
CHARLOTTE	"Good, you're back."
WESLEY	"I swear to God, if you hand me a muffin, I'm out of here."
CHARLOTTE	You don't know Samantha.
CHARLOTTE	I do.
CHARLOTTE	"She has so many notches on her bedpost, it's almost whittled down to a toothpick."
WESLEY	It was fun.
CHARLOTTE	I know.
CHARLOTTE	"You had your little fling, now you can go back to Leslie and work it out."
WESLEY	We're not working it out.
WESLEY	You think you know Wesley and Leslie? Let me tell you about Wesley and Leslie.
WESLEY	"Leslie's frigid and before last night, Wesley hadn't gotten laid in two years."
CHARLOTTE	my god.
WESLEY	I was going out Of my mind.
WESLEY	I've seen a pastor.
WESLEY	I've seen a shrink.
WESLEY	"But until I saw Samantha, I didn't realize what I really needed: Sex."
CHARLOTTE	So It was a good thing.
WESLEY	It was a frigging Great thing.
WESLEY	That Samantha You've really got a good friend there.
CHARLOTTE	It's Charlotte.
CHARLOTTE	That was a terrible thing I said.
SAMANTHA	"Yes, It was."
SAMANTHA	If you'll excuse me I have another tour group coming through my vagina in 10 minutes.
CHARLOTTE	I'm so sorry.
SAMANTHA	You said What You came to say?
CARRIE	Samantha was touched.
CARRIE	"She realized this was Charlotte's way of saying ""Thank you for fucking my brother."
SAMANTHA	Get in there.
VOICE ON INTERCOM	"Hey, kids! Funtastics on Three."
CARRIE	Miranda decided she had ceded enough territory to the invading troops.
GYM MOM	Do you mind? He really loves to push the button.
IRANDA	Yeah? So do I.
VAUGHN WEISEL	That is so sexy.
VAUGHN WEISEL	You in bed with my book.
CARRIE	It's really great.
VAUGHN WEISEL	do That again.
CARRIE	"What, turn the page?"
VAUGHN WEISEL	Again.
CARRIE	"Wait, stop."
CARRIE	Let's just take this nice and slow.
CARRIE	You tell me if you're feeling too excited and we'll take a little break.
VAUGHN WEISEL	Why?
CARRIE	Because I think we both really want this to work.
CARRIE	I love that you get so turned on by me and I am very turned on by you.
CARRIE	Maybe we've just been in too much of a rush.
VAUGHN WEISEL	forget it.
CARRIE	"No, I don't want to forget it."
CARRIE	Come here.
CARRIE	Let's talk about it.
VAUGHN WEISEL	No! I don't want to talk about it.
CARRIE	I think we have to.
VAUGHN WEISEL	Why does everything have to be about sex! I am so sick of talking about sex.
VAUGHN WEISEL	I've been talking about it since I was 2.
VAUGHN WEISEL	So let's go.
VAUGHN WEISEL	My parents are expecting us.
WALLACE WEISEL	Duncan and I went down to the Neil Simon Theater and spent $65
DUNCAN WEISEL	"Seventy five.
"
WALLACE WEISEL	To see a British movie star simulate a blowjob.
DUNCAN WEISEL	I wonder if that's what Neil had in mind.
FRANNY	did she show her tits?
WALLACE WEISEL	no.
WALLACE WEISEL	How's the pickled herring?
JENNA 	It's very good.
WALLACE WEISEL	Franny tells me that you two are going camping this weekend.
VAUGHN WEISEL	Where's the scallion cream cheese?
WALLACE WEISEL	It's out there on the table.
VAUGHN WEISEL	I don't see it.
WALLACE WEISEL	Then check the refrigerator.
DUNCAN WEISEL	Why is he So edgy?
CARRIE	I have No idea.
ZOOEY	Don't let him pull that moody shit on you.
FRANNY	I know.
FRANNY	It's such a pose.
FRANNY	"Since he got published, he's suddenly this tortured artist."
VAUGHN WEISEL	Where's the cream cheese?
WALLACE WEISEL	It's out there.
VAUGHN WEISEL	Why buy this shit if you can't remember the one thing that holds it all together?
WALLACE WEISEL	Let's deal with what's really upsetting you.
WALLACE WEISEL	Shall we?
VAUGHN WEISEL	"If everything's on the table, why don't we start with some scallion cream cheese?"
CARRIE	Jenna and I looked at each other like two foreigners without visas.
CARRIE	"You know what, I think I'd better go."
CARRIE	I've got a deadline.
CARRIE	I'll go.
CARRIE	"Thank you for lunch, for everything."
WALLACE WEISEL	What happened? Everything was going so well.
CARRIE	It really wasn't.
WALLACE WEISEL	I know what it is.
WALLACE WEISEL	His last girlfriend wasn't as discreet.
WALLACE WEISEL	I don't want to get in the irony.
WALLACE WEISEL	He writes short stories.
CARRIE	This has officially become too weird.
WALLACE WEISEL	"Really, in a situation like this, you gotta laugh."
WALLACE WEISEL	"All right, it's a problem."
WALLACE WEISEL	But you'll work it out.
CARRIE	He won't even talk about it.
WALLACE WEISEL	You want me to talk to him?
CARRIE	no.
CARRIE	I can't discuss this with you.
WALLACE WEISEL	So your sex life isn't so great.
WALLACE WEISEL	So what? Seventy-seven percent of all marriages are sexless.
WALLACE WEISEL	"Other things are so much more important, like family."
CARRIE	Then I saw that the person I really had to break up with wasn't Vaughn.
CARRIE	It was his mother.
CARRIE	I would still like us to be friends.
CARRIE	"No, I mean that."
WALLACE WEISEL	"And what happens when you meet somebody else? I can tell you now, they won't have a mother like me."
WALLACE WEISEL	You know that.
WALLACE WEISEL	You know that we have something.
WALLACE WEISEL	What we have is very special.
WALLACE WEISEL	"All right, well."
WALLACE WEISEL	Call me sometime.
CARRIE	I will.
WALLACE WEISEL	sweetie.
CARRIE	Wallis was right.
CARRIE	The most important thing in life is your family.
CARRIE	"There are days you love them, and others you don't."
CARRIE	"But in the end, they're the people you always come home to."
CARRIE	Sometimes it's the family you're born into.
CARRIE	And sometimes it's the one you make for yourself.
CHARLOTTE	What are You doing here?
IRANDA	Come here.
CARRIE	My friend Charlotte was dating Dr. Bram Walker...
CARRIE	...a very hardworking orthopedic surgeon.
CHARLOTTE	Bram?
BRAM	What?
CHARLOTTE	Were you asleep?
BRAM	"No, I was just resting my eyes."
CHARLOTTE	My God.
BRAM	I fell asleep for one second.
CHARLOTTE	My God.
BRAM	"I was up at 5:00, I had three carpal tunnels."
BRAM	It's very exhaustive reconstructive work.
CHARLOTTE	He fell asleep when he was making love to me. He fell asleep!
CARRIE	He was tired. This has nothing to do with you.
CHARLOTTE	Has a man ever fallen asleep making love to you?
CARRIE	"No, but I'm sure many of them wanted to."
CHARLOTTE	I can't believe this happened to me!
CARRIE	You want some herb tea?
CHARLOTTE	I must be really bad in bed.
CARRIE	You are not bad in bed.
CARRIE	I've got Constant Comment and do you want some Tummy Tamer?
SAMANTHA	"Of course it's her. I have to say, I'm not surprised."
SAMANTHA	Ever seen her on a Stairmaster? Nothing happening below the waist.
SAMANTHA	Nada. No sale.
CARRIE	How can you say that?
CARRIE	"Even if she was bad in bed, which she isn't, is it really that important?"
SAMANTHA	Absolutely. Who we are in bed is who we are in life.
SAMANTHA	I never met a man who was bad in bed who was good at life.
CARRIE	"Just for the record, in bed, you are...."
SAMANTHA	Don't make me state the obvious.
CARRIE	How can you be so sure?
SAMANTHA	No one ever took a nap while fucking me and I get affirmations all the time.
SAMANTHA	Just Last week....
CARRIE	"Last week, Samantha had dinner with a gay couple she'd known for years."
SAMANTHA	David and David.
SAMANTHA	Thanks for a lovely dinner. It was fun.
DAVID 2	"I have to admit, we have an ulterior motive."
SAMANTHA	What?
DAVID 2	We're wondering if you're seeing anyone special right now?
SAMANTHA	"Actually, no. Do you have a hot guy for me?"
DAVID 1	Two.
SAMANTHA	-No!
DAVID 2	-Yes!
DAVID 1	We want to have sex with a woman.
SAMANTHA	are You serious?
DAVID 2	-Totally. I'm always curious what it would be like.
DAVID 2	We've never done it and we thought it might be fun.
DAVID 2	We were like:
DAVID 2	"If we were gonna do it with a woman, who would it be?'"
DAVID 2	"then we were like, Samantha."
DAVID 1	Totally.
DAVID 2	"We decided of all the beautiful women we know, you are probably the best in bed."
DAVID 1	Totally. Look at that!
SAMANTHA	"I'm thinking about doing it. They're cute, they're healthy."
CARRIE	They're gay!
CARRIE	"For a sex columnist, you have a limited view of sexuality."
CARRIE	Gay as pink suede.
SAMANTHA	Wake up. It's 2000.
SAMANTHA	"The new millennium won't be about sexual labels, it'll be about sexual expression."
SAMANTHA	It won't matter if you're sleeping with men or women.
SAMANTHA	It'll be about sleeping with individuals.
CARRIE	"Or in your case, twos or threes."
SAMANTHA	Soon everyone will be pansexual. It won't matter if you're gay or straight.
CARRIE	-Just if you're good or bad in bed.
SAMANTHA	Exactly.
CARRIE	That night I got to thinking about bed.
CARRIE	Are we secretly being graded every time we invite someone to join us in it?
CARRIE	"A plus, B, D, incomplete."
CARRIE	Is making love really nothing more than a pop quiz?
CARRIE	"If sex is a test, how do we know if we're passing or failing?"
CARRIE	How do you know if you're good in bed?
CARRIE	"Later that week, I was walking home thinking about my own sexual report card when...."
CARRIE	What the hell--
PATRICK CASEY	"Christ, I'm sorry. I didn't see you. I just threw my cigarette."
CARRIE	I thought I was stung by a bee. Jesus!
PATRICK CASEY	I'm sorry. Did it leave a mark?
PATRICK CASEY	You can't smoke in the restaurant. I'm a smoker.
CARRIE	"I'm a smoker too, but watch where you throw those things?"
CARRIE	"No, it didn't leave a mark."
CARRIE	"As the pain subsided, my mind was free to notice..."
CARRIE	...how incredibly cute this guy was.
PATRICK CASEY	I am sorry. My name's Patrick Casey.
CARRIE	"Carrie Bradshaw, burn victim."
PATRICK CASEY	How weird was that? That was intense.
PATRICK CASEY	"You gotta admit, it's a clever way to meet the ladies."
CARRIE	You got a little comedy routine going there?
PATRICK CASEY	Little bit.
PATRICK CASEY	"Listen, I really feel bad."
PATRICK CASEY	"At least let me buy you a cup of coffee, or some burn salve?"
CARRIE	not funny yet.
PATRICK CASEY	Sorry.
CARRIE	But it might be after a cappuccino.
PATRICK CASEY	There's a place right around the corner. We can smoke there.
CARRIE	Three Marlboros and two Marlboro Lights later I had learned...
CARRIE	"...Patrick was a composer, writing music for movies."
CARRIE	What type of movies do you compose for?
PATRICK CASEY	Really bad ones.
PATRICK CASEY	The I Screamed When I Knew What You Did Last Summer On Elm Street types.
CARRIE	As long as you're challenged by what you do.
CARRIE	"Dammit. Patrick Casey, whoever you are. I'm late. I have to go."
CARRIE	Thank you for the coffee. Maybe one day you'll give me scar tissue again.
PATRICK CASEY	-You're great.
CARRIE	Thanks.
CARRIE	"As I walked away, I started to think:"
CARRIE	"How many cute, smart, single smokers are there left in the world? Seven?"
CARRIE	I decided to do something I almost never do...
CARRIE	...give a man my phone number.
CARRIE	This whole burn lawsuit I plan to initiate...
CARRIE	"...it might get a little crazy, so here is my phone number."
CARRIE	You will need that for your attorney...
CARRIE	...or if you want to have coffee again sometime.
CARRIE	I left feeling great. It was such a cute approach. How could he not call?
CARRIE	How could he not call? It's been three days.
IRANDA	Give him 12 more hours and then send him off to the island of lost men.
CARRIE	"I don't wanna send him there, I like him."
IRANDA	Could you believe that someone actually had the nerve to call this Florentine Peach?
CARRIE	I can't believe you spent this much on sheets.
IRANDA	It's an experiment. I'm trying to change my bed karma.
IRANDA	I figure if I can make my bed a place I really want to be...
IRANDA	...others will feel the same way.
CARRIE	The field of dreams.
R	"Exactly. 'If you build it, he will come.'"
CARRIE	"The thing that gets me is, I'm not usually wrong about the phone number size-up."
CARRIE	I don't put it out there unless I'm pretty sure it's coming back.
IRANDA	I'm either really loving or hating the color.
CARRIE	He thinks I'm ugly.
IRANDA	My God. Get a grip.
IRANDA	A guy doesn't call you for three days and you're ugly?
CARRIE	-What's your point?
IRANDA	Pillowcase.
IRANDA	It's amazing. We can feel totally good about ourselves...
IRANDA	...and then it all goes out the window if the guy doesn't mirror it that way back to us.
IRANDA	This has a little weird thing here.
IRANDA	Dammit. Does everything I bring into this bedroom have to have a flaw?
CARRIE	The next day I was in the Village looking for the perfect $7 dress...
CARRIE	"...to go with my $300 shoes, when...."
CARRIE	I had a choice. I could turn around and run away...
CARRIE	"...or I could smile, be brave and walk on over."
CARRIE	Hi.
CARRIE	So what? Saturday's the day you stand on the street and smoke in the Village?
CARRIE	"Hi, I'm Carrie."
PATRICK CASEY	-We're kind of in the middle of something.
CARRIE	"Right, Sure."
CARRIE	Bye. I was on my way to Perry Street.
PATRICK CASEY	This is Perry Street.
CARRIE	"Bleecker, I meant Bleecker. Okay, bye. Goodbye to you, too."
PATRICK CASEY	Listen. let me explain.
CARRIE	"-No, I'm embarrassed."
CARRIE	You're obviously in the middle of a thing with your lover...
CARRIE	...or whoever and I'm there....
PATRICK CASEY	No. I'm not gay. I'm an alcoholic.
PATRICK CASEY	We were just waiting for a meeting to start.
PATRICK CASEY	I wanted to introduce you but it's supposed to be anonymous.
CARRIE	I really wasn't getting the gay vibe from you.
CARRIE	"It's just, he was so cute and...."
PATRICK CASEY	I never called.
CARRIE	Right.
PATRICK CASEY	I was freaked. I've only been in the program 11 months...
PATRICK CASEY	...and my sponsor said I really shouldn't get involved with someone for a year.
CARRIE	"Okay, maybe you'll call me in a month."
PATRICK CASEY	It doesn't bother you that I'm an alcoholic?
CARRIE	"God, no. I love alcoholics. Hell, I hope to be one someday."
CARRIE	That was a joke.
PATRICK CASEY	"-That's not funny, yet."
CARRIE	But it might be after a cappuccino.
PATRICK CASEY	"What the fuck, it's only a couple of weeks."
PATRICK CASEY	Would you like to go on a date sometime?
CARRIE	I can't think why not. You call me.
CARRIE	I accepted his kind invitation because when you think about it...
CARRIE	...aren't we all in recovery from something?
CARRIE	Drinking? Drugging? Our last relationship?
CARRIE	"On our first date, Patrick and I went for coffee."
PATRICK CASEY	"I'm really compulsive. If I open up a bag of Chips Ahoy, I gotta eat the whole thing."
CARRIE	I'm like that with Reese's Pieces. Reese's Pieces and shoes.
PATRICK CASEY	Wouldn't the shoes be a little tough on digestion?
CARRIE	"This is me. Thank you, Mr. Casey. I had a great time."
PATRICK CASEY	"No, Miss Burn Victim. I had the great time."
CARRIE	Then I gave him my very best lean-in-and-kiss-me-goodnight move.
CARRIE	"Our next date, over dinner, he told me about working his 12 steps."
CARRIE	"After dinner, I stood on my third step trying to work him."
PATRICK CASEY	That smell is amazing. What is that?
CARRIE	Me.
PATRICK CASEY	I'll call you.
CARRIE	I couldn't figure it out.
CARRIE	"I knew he wanted me, because during my lean-in-and-kiss-me-goodnight move..."
CARRIE	"...I'd accidentally, on purpose felt his pop-up-and-say-hello."
CARRIE	What was going on?
CARRIE	"By the third date, I wanted him even more than a fistful of Reese's Pieces."
CARRIE	"Well then, goodnight."
CARRIE	That was that. I'd hit my humiliation limit.
CARRIE	"Then I thought, how many cute, smart, sexy, single, smoking alcoholics..."
CARRIE	...are there left in the world? Five?
CARRIE	Do you want to come up?
PATRICK CASEY	"Yeah, But you see, the thing is, I've never had sex sober."
PATRICK CASEY	I've always been drunk or high. I don't know if I'll be any good.
PATRICK CASEY	What the hell? Let's take it one step at a time.
PATRICK CASEY	Sex is amazing. It feels so fucking amazing.
PATRICK CASEY	Do other people know about this? All right! I did it! Sex without beer!
PATRICK CASEY	"Easy, cowboy."
CARRIE	You! What about you! You are the best.
PATRICK CASEY	You weren't half bad yourself.
PATRICK CASEY	You are the best.
PATRICK CASEY	-You're the best.
CARRIE	I aim to please.
PATRICK CASEY	After we have a cigarette...can we do it again?
CARRIE	"I'll have a Spanish omelet, hash browns, more coffee and orange juice."
CARRIE	Can I have some rice pudding for later? Thanks.
SAMANTHA	Storing up for winter?
CARRIE	"No, I'm starving. Patrick and I...All last night and I'm just...."
CHARLOTTE	"No, don't stop, it's okay. Just because I'm bad in bed doesn't mean everybody has to be."
IRANDA	One more time. You are not bad in bed.
CHARLOTTE	Really? Has a man ever fallen asleep making love to you?
SAMANTHA	"No, but I once fell asleep when a guy was doing me. It was the ludes."
CHARLOTTE	It's okay.
CHARLOTTE	I'm mature enough to realize that while I may be good at some things like...
CHARLOTTE	"...accessories, that I might need help in others like...."
SAMANTHA	Fucking?
CHARLOTTE	"-Making love. So, I'm taking a class."
SAMANTHA	A fucking class?
CHARLOTTE	"No, a tantric sex workshop."
CARRIE	Just don't drink any suspicious Kool-Aid or put on new Nikes.
CHARLOTTE	It's not like that. It's taught by a well-respected woman psychologist.
CHARLOTTE	It's called 'How To Please A Man.'
IRANDA	I know how to please a man. Just give away most of your power.
CHARLOTTE	I have a trainer for the gym. I can have a trainer for--
SAMANTHA	Fucking?
CHARLOTTE	Please Stop saying that.
CARRIE	Are you actually going to do this?
CHARLOTTE	"Seating was limited, so I signed you guys up. Please? I can't go alone."
CHARLOTTE	"If Bram ever falls asleep on me again, I will die. Pretty please, with sugar on it?"
CARRIE	"Christ, I'm in."
IRANDA	"What the hell, I don't exactly have them hanging from the rafters."
SAMANTHA	How To Please A Man.' I could teach the damn class. All right.
CARRIE	"That night, while David and David got undressed..."
CARRIE	...and waited for her in the bedroom.
CARRIE	Samantha began to wonder if maybe she was about to go too far.
CARRIE	Was she actually capable of being this sexually free?
CARRIE	Or was she getting in over her head?
CARRIE	"She decided before there were any regrets, they should all talk about it a little more."
SAMANTHA	"Listen, David and David, maybe...."
DAVID 2	You look amazing.
DAVID 1	Just like Jean Harlow in Red Dust.
CARRIE	Samantha loved the Samantha mirrored through the eyes of the Davids.
SAMANTHA	What the hell?
DAVID 2	-They're so soft.
DAVID 1	I know.
DAVID 2	-I can't do this.
DAVID 1	Neither can I.
SAMANTHA	-But I...We're just getting start-
DAVID 2	"-No, can't."
DAVID 1	-I'm sorry.
DAVID 1	"Sorry. It's very pretty, but no. It's not you, it's us."
DAVID 2	I have an idea. Let's all put on our clothes and go out for gelati!
DAVID 1	Cheesecake.
DAVID 2	Whatever.
CARRIE	"Suddenly, Samantha wasn't feeling so good about herself in bed."
CARRIE	I gotta go or I'm going to be late for the tantric workshop thing.
PATRICK CASEY	"Baby, you don't need a workshop. You are amazing."
PATRICK CASEY	"Come on, one more time."
CARRIE	We did it last night and all this morning.
PATRICK CASEY	"I could have sex with you morning, noon and night."
CARRIE	That's when I realized it. Mr. Compulsive wasn't in bed with me...
PATRICK CASEY	"More, c'mon."
CARRIE	...he was in bed with a big bag of Chips Ahoy.
PATRICK CASEY	More.
TANTRIC INSTRUCTOR	The intent of tantric...we say 'sacred sexuality...'
TANTRIC INSTRUCTOR	...is to experience and merge with the Divine.
CARRIE	I think Patrick's addicted to me.
CARRIE	It's like he's replaced drinking with me.
IRANDA	Program guys are tough.
IRANDA	I dated a guy who was in Over-Eaters Anonymous.
IRANDA	"Every time we had a fight, he'd binge-eat hot fudge sundaes."
TANTRIC INSTRUCTOR	"In other words, ladies, to drive your man crazy."
CARRIE	He wants to have sex all the time. It's getting a little out of hand.
SAMANTHA	At least he wants to fuck you.
CARRIE	they were gay.
SAMANTHA	So?
SAMANTHA	"One minute they were interested and then, suddenly they weren't."
SAMANTHA	What did I do to turn them off?
IRANDA	Not having a dick would be the thing that you did to turn them off.
CHARLOTTE	"You guys, I'm serious. This is rude."
TANTRIC INSTRUCTOR	"Use it to bring any man to his knees. With love, of course."
SAMANTHA	Where was this bitch last night when I needed her?
CHARLOTTE	Be quiet and you might learn something. This lady is supposed to be a genius.
IRANDA	"If she's so good, why is she having this workshop in her apartment?"
CHARLOTTE	I don't know.
TANTRIC INSTRUCTOR	"Tantric sex is not about talk, it's about action. Delayed action."
TANTRIC INSTRUCTOR	"So, without further delay...let me introduce my husband. Dr. Ronny Shapiro."
TANTRIC INSTRUCTOR	I will demonstrate the very effective...Lingham Massage.
IRANDA	I think I know why we're in an apartment.
TANTRIC INSTRUCTOR	"The receiver lies on his back...before the giver, naked."
TANTRIC INSTRUCTOR	Genitals clearly exposed for the massage.
IRANDA	You're not writing.
TANTRIC INSTRUCTOR	Take your time doing this.
CARRIE	"An hour and a half later, crippled by our inability to look away from a car crash..."
CARRIE	...we watched as the Dr. Shapiro illustrated tantric sex.
TANTRIC INSTRUCTOR	Massage the head of the Lingham...as if you are using an orange juicer.
IRANDA	There go my good feelings about breakfast.
CHARLOTTE	Stop it! You're embarrassing me.
CARRIE	We're the embarrassing part?
TANTRIC INSTRUCTOR	Place your right hand...on the receiver's Root chakra.
IRANDA	Root!
TANTRIC INSTRUCTOR	The Root chakra is located between the anus and the genitals.
IRANDA	I think that I just got my 50 bucks worth.
TANTRIC INSTRUCTOR	Gently rock your hand to awaken this chakra.
TANTRIC INSTRUCTOR	Clinically referred to as perineum.
IRANDA	Perineum: Latin for 'not without an engagement ring.'
TANTRIC INSTRUCTOR	Will the women who are laughing compose themselves?
TANTRIC INSTRUCTOR	Thank you. Orgasm is not the goal of Lingham Massage...
TANTRIC INSTRUCTOR	...but can be a pleasant and very welcome side effect.
TANTRIC INSTRUCTOR	Watch what I'm doing here. If you can master this...
TANTRIC INSTRUCTOR	...your man will always be faithful.
TANTRIC INSTRUCTOR	Because once they go tantric...they don't go back.
SAMANTHA	"You go, girl."
TANTRIC INSTRUCTOR	See that? Can you all see this?
IRANDA	My God!
IRANDA	He's gonna....
CARRIE	"And just like that, Miranda got hit by Old Faithful."
IRANDA	What's funny?
CARRIE	"That night after we talked Miranda in from the ledge, I met Patrick for a movie."
PATRICK CASEY	I was telling my sponsor today how I felt about you...
PATRICK CASEY	...and suddenly I realized maybe I should just tell you. I love you.
CARRIE	"There it was, the little phrase every girl is dying to hear..."
CARRIE	...a week and a half into a relationship.
CARRIE	Thanks and that's so...
PATRICK CASEY	What? Too soon? Is that what you're thinking?
CARRIE	"We have been going out for, like, a minute."
PATRICK CASEY	Fuck that shit. I don't want to play games.
PATRICK CASEY	I'm just trying to own my feelings. I love you. I said it.
CARRIE	"Mr. Casey, you do not love me...you love you, not drinking, with me."
PATRICK CASEY	"No, I love you."
CARRIE	I'm so flattered...but I think maybe we should slow down a little here.
PATRICK CASEY	What does that mean?
CARRIE	It means that things are going very fast and....
CARRIE	You have all these new feelings because you're not drinking...
PATRICK CASEY	"No, don't give me that program bullshit."
PATRICK CASEY	This has nothing to do with drinking. I love you.
CARRIE	Maybe we should spend a little time apart. I'll call you tomorrow.
PATRICK CASEY	-I'm not coming up?
CARRIE	Just a couple Of nights.
PATRICK CASEY	Are you breaking up with me? 'Cause if...
CARRIE	I'm not breaking up with you. I'm just going inside.
CARRIE	"Call me tomorrow. We'll do something next week, okay?"
PATRICK CASEY	What am I going to do now?
CARRIE	"You should go to a meeting. And then go home, and call me tomorrow."
CARRIE	Goodnight. I'll see you next week. Go.
CARRIE	Get yourself some cookies.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, across town at Charlotte's...."
BRAM	"My God, what are you doing? My God."
BRAM	You are good. Sweet Christ! You are good!
CARRIE	Charlotte considered it the best 50 bucks she'd ever spent.
CARRIE	"It cost Miranda a little more, but across town in her bed, things were good as well."
PATRICK CASEY	Carrie!
CARRIE	What are you doing?
PATRICK CASEY	"Fuck you, you bitch!"
CARRIE	Shit!
PATRICK CASEY	I loved you and you didn't love me.
PATRICK CASEY	You fucking made me date you...before the month and now I'm drunk.
PATRICK CASEY	And I don't care! I love you! I love you! Make love to me!
CARRIE	What are you doing? Don't take your clothes off.
CARRIE	My first impulse was to go down and rescue him...
CARRIE	"...but as I learned on our second date, that would be codependent."
CARRIE	"Still, I felt I had to do something."
CARRIE	"Here, put this on, you'll get a cold."
PATRICK CASEY	I hope I fucking die!
NEIGBHOR	"Quiet, asshole, I'll call the cops!"
PATRICK CASEY	"Shut the fuck up, dickweed!"
PATRICK CASEY	Carrie! You were the best fuck I ever had!
CARRIE	"Three weeks later, I got a letter from Patrick..."
CARRIE	...saying he was back in the program and wanted to make amends.
CARRIE	I never saw him again but I always wondered two things:
CARRIE	Was he able to stay sober? Am I really that good in bed?
CARRIE	"This is a story about a lovely couple, Rob and Elaine..."
CARRIE	...who rented a house one especially hot and sticky summer in the Hamptons.
CARRIE	"Elaine invited her best single friends, Cindy and Janet..."
CARRIE	"...while Rob invited his single friends, Ira and Matthew..."
CARRIE	...to share the good times and exorbitant rent.
CARRIE	"Until one day, this lovely couple had a terrible fight..."
CARRIE	...when Elaine went for a run and twisted her ankle...
CARRIE	...and came back early to find Rob canoodling with Janet.
CARRIE	And Cindy got tired of Matthew's idiotic jokes and incessant market chatter.
CARRIE	Ira tried to be there for Elaine and confessed his true feelings for her...
CARRIE	...which she tried to laugh off as a joke.
CARRIE	"By August, it got to the point where everything was so awkward..."
CARRIE	...that nobody wanted to come back.
CARRIE	And that's when Janet called her friend Charlotte.
CHARLOTTE	It's a really cute three-bedroom cottage.
CHARLOTTE	They're giving us a fantastic deal for the month of August.
CARRIE	Because it's haunted with cheating boyfriends and sexual rejection.
SAMANTHA	We can always burn sage.
IRANDA	Sharing a house with your girlfriends is fine in your 20s...
IRANDA	"...but I feel like in your 30s, isn't it a bit pathetic, like being the oldest kid at summer camp?"
SAMANTHA	"She has a point. My 25-year-old assistant, Nina Grabowski..."
SAMANTHA	...has a summer share in Bridgehampton with 18 other girls.
SAMANTHA	They have to sleep in shifts.
CARRIE	What if they meet someone?
SAMANTHA	"they Fuck in shifts, too."
CHARLOTTE	Hold it.
CHARLOTTE	I can't believe you guys would pass up a chance to get out of this heat.
CHARLOTTE	"Besides, the city's completely dead during August."
CARRIE	-That's because everyone's in the Hamptons.
IRANDA	Or stuck in traffic trying to get there.
CHARLOTTE	This could be the Last summer we can actually all get together and do something like this.
CHARLOTTE	"I mean, next year, who knows? One of us could be married or have kids."
CHARLOTTE	And we'll always regret that last summer we didn't spend together in the Hamptons.
CARRIE	Charlotte's sweet hopefulness touched something in all of us.
CARRIE	"Okay, I'm in."
IRANDA	"me, too."
SAMANTHA	"Fine, but I get the late shift."
CARRIE	Samantha always felt like she was in her 20s...
CARRIE	...until seeing an actual twenty-something brought her down to earth.
NINA GRABOWSKI	"No, I'm getting you on the VIP list. You have to try it for one night."
NINA GRABOWSKI	My best friend Jerry owns it. He also owns the one in South Beach.
NINA GRABOWSKI	"Yes, the same one."
SAMANTHA	I need to proof and confirm the guest list for the Hetrick-Martin benefit.
SAMANTHA	"And get me Richard Johnson, ASAP."
NINA GRABOWSKI	"He is not a fag, because I happen to have three friends he's personally fucked."
NINA GRABOWSKI	You are nasty. You are.
NINA GRABOWSKI	"I'm sending you a car, to and fro, and if you hate it, I'm gonna let you blow me. I am."
SAMANTHA	"I am serious. Off, now."
NINA GRABOWSKI	"Alec, I've gotta go. I'll keep you posted, okay? Bye, honey."
NINA GRABOWSKI	"I have personal relationships of my own, you know."
SAMANTHA	"-Not with my clients, you don't."
NINA GRABOWSKI	I have my career to worry about.
SAMANTHA	Your career is being my assistant.
NINA GRABOWSKI	You're so deluded. I mean you wouldn't even know what's hot if it wasn't for me.
SAMANTHA	Unfortunately you don't seem to grasp the vast difference between us.
NINA GRABOWSKI	"Yes, I do. You stood in line at Studio 54..."
NINA GRABOWSKI	"...I stood in line at Studio 54, the movie."
SAMANTHA	I gave that bitch her first job out of college. She didn't know a fucking thing!
SAMANTHA	"Girls in their 20s, they're spoiled and ungrateful. They think they're it."
SAMANTHA	"Don't they realize, we're still it?"
IRANDA	"No, because the world validates their delusion."
SAMANTHA	And she took a copy of my Rolodex. Do you think I can sue?
CARRIE	-Do you remember us in our 20s?
SAMANTHA	Dimly.
CARRIE	Have some compassion.
CARRIE	The only thing worse than being single in your 30s in this city is being single in your 20s.
CHARLOTTE	Where've you been? I was worried you'd miss the jitney.
CARRIE	The Hamptons Jitney is like the bus to summer camp...
CARRIE	...only instead of singing songs everyone ignores each other and talks on their cell.
CHARLOTTE	"Everyone, this is Greg."
CHARLOTTE	"This is Samantha, Carrie and Miranda."
GREG	Hi!
CHARLOTTE	Greg's been going to the Hamptons every summer for 20 years.
GREG	Since I was six.
IRANDA	You do the math.
CARRIE	I have.
CHARLOTTE	Thank you.
IRANDA	"Easy, sister, no need to push."
CARRIE	"Four bumper-to-bumper hours later, we arrived at our new digs."
SAMANTHA	"They said this place was shabby chic, I'm thinking it's much more shitty chic."
IRANDA	These towels are mildewed.
IRANDA	"Actually, this whole house smells like mildew."
CARRIE	"It's not mildew, it's beachy."
CHARLOTTE	Would you all stop being so cynical? We're lucky to be here.
CARRIE	Cynicism. Now there's one advantage we have over girls in their 20s.
IRANDA	I was cynical in high school.
IRANDA	Who's that?
CHARLOTTE	"It's Greg, that cute guy I met on the jitney. I told him to drop by."
CHARLOTTE	"And if he asks, he thinks I'm 27."
CARRIE	"Evidently, while we had taken the Midtown Tunnel..."
CARRIE	...Charlotte had taken the time tunnel.
CHARLOTTE	-Hi!
GREG	Hey.
CHARLOTTE	Come on in. You guys remember Greg.
GROUP	"Hi, Greg."
GREG	Hey! Listen. Me and my housemates are having a big bonfire tonight at the beach...
GREG	...and I just wanted to tell you that you're all invited.
CHARLOTTE	Excellent!
CARRIE	"Here you go, ladies."
IRANDA	There's so much foam you could ski on the head!
CARRIE	"Sorry, it's been awhile since I pumped a keg."
SAMANTHA	"I love young men, but come on. The guys here they don't even have chest hair yet!"
CARRIE	That's good news for their backs.
PARTY-GOER	Sorry!
IRANDA	"Okay, this is really fun. How long do we have to stay?"
SAMANTHA	God!
CARRIE	I'm gonna go tell Charlotte we're leaving.
CARRIE	That's another thing about twenty-something girls. They're very considerate.
CARRIE	You can always count on one of them to hold your hair when you vomit.
LAUREL HARRIS	"Excuse me! My God, Carrie Bradshaw!"
CARRIE	Yeah?
LAUREL HARRIS	Laurel Harris. May I Just Tell You That I worship you?
LAUREL HARRIS	"I read your column every week, it's like my religion."
CARRIE	Thank you.
LAUREL HARRIS	"I work as an assistant in a publishing house, but I'm really a writer."
CARRIE	great.
LAUREL HARRIS	We'll see. Maybe I could send you something to read sometime?
CARRIE	Sure.
LAUREL HARRIS	You have no idea that would mean to me.
LAUREL HARRIS	To have someone like you as my mentor.
CARRIE	"Well, mentor."
LAUREL HARRIS	Could I call you sometime in the city?
LAUREL HARRIS	"If I could just spend some time with you, that would be so cool."
CARRIE	Of course. I'll be looking at a very busy summer.
LAUREL HARRIS	"I can help. I'll run errands, I'll do your wash."
CARRIE	No menial labor necessary. I'll just give you my phone number.
LAUREL HARRIS	"My God, this is so cool."
CARRIE	Thank you.
LAUREL HARRIS	-It's okay.
CARRIE	Thank you.
CARRIE	"The next day, Miranda woke up early to enjoy the cool morning breeze..."
CARRIE	...and a much-needed moment of solitude.
IRANDA	"All right, somebody puked on the deck."
CHARLOTTE	Sorry...Stacey and Holly did too many Jell-O shots.
IRANDA	"What are you, 25 now?"
GREG	Good morning.
CHARLOTTE	"No, 27!"
IRANDA	Whatever.
CARRIE	"That week, back in the city, I wondered what was the allure of the 20s?"
CARRIE	"On one hand, there's great skin tone, the thrill of fresh experience..."
CARRIE	...and the sense of a consequence-free life full of seemingly endless possibilities.
CARRIE	"While on the other, there are horrible apartments, sexually inexperienced men..."
CARRIE	...and embarrassing errors in fashion judgment.
CARRIE	"Should we fear these freshly minted, single women as a threat to our very survival..."
CARRIE	...or pity them as clueless half-wits about to get their dreams dashed...
CARRIE	...and illusions shattered?
CARRIE	Twenty-something girls...friend or foe?
CARRIE	"And that evening, in my first act as a mentor..."
CARRIE	...I took my young acolyte to a book party.
LAUREL HARRIS	My God. I can't believe I'm out with Carrie Bradshaw. This is too cool.
CARRIE	"Stop, I can feel my head swelling."
CARRIE	"If it gets any bigger, I'll have to say goodbye to my hats."
LAUREL HARRIS	I have a question. Do you think that 25 is too young to write a personal memoir?
CARRIE	"As long as it doesn't deal with incest, Prozac, or partying, no."
LAUREL HARRIS	"It does deal with sex, or rather not having sex."
LAUREL HARRIS	It's about how girls my age are saving themselves for marriage.
CARRIE	Saving What for marriage?
LAUREL HARRIS	our virginity.
CARRIE	Are you seriously telling me that you've never had sex with a man?
LAUREL HARRIS	That is correct.
CARRIE	"Okay, what do you consider sex?"
LAUREL HARRIS	Are you implying I'm some kind of Lewinsky?
LAUREL HARRIS	"I'm not! I'm talking no blowjobs, no hand jobs."
CARRIE	"All right, I get it, no jobs of any kind."
CARRIE	You know what? I think I need to get a drink.
LAUREL HARRIS	"-I'll get it. Cosmopolitan, right?"
CARRIE	Yeah.
LAUREL HARRIS	I remember from your column.
CARRIE	A 25-year-old virgin was getting me a Cosmopolitan.
CARRIE	The generation gap had never seemed so wide.
BRADLEY MEEGO	Hi.
CARRIE	"have You Actually read the book? -No, have you?"
BRADLEY MEEGO	Not yet.
CARRIE	Know anything about the author?
CARRIE	His family has a history of diabetes and he has a steel splint in his left femur.
BRADLEY MEEGO	"-I'm his doctor, Bradley Meego."
CARRIE	Carrie Bradshaw.
CARRIE	"My doctor won't even make house calls, let alone attend a book party."
BRADLEY MEEGO	I've never been to one before. I thought it might be interesting.
BRADLEY MEEGO	It's exceeded all my expectations.
CARRIE	"Generally, it's just cheese and crackers. You never see an actual shrimp."
BRADLEY MEEGO	"No, I meant you."
BRADLEY MEEGO	I'd ask you for a drink after but I'm driving straight to the Hamptons.
CARRIE	I'm actually going out to the Hamptons tomorrow.
BRADLEY MEEGO	"Great, can I call you there?"
CARRIE	"All right, you know what? I'll be with my friends Saturday at Townline Beach."
CARRIE	A big yellow umbrella. You can come by and say hello if you like.
BRADLEY MEEGO	Is this a ploy to see me in my bathing suit?
LAUREL HARRIS	-Here's your Cosmo.
CARRIE	Thank you.
CARRIE	"Dr. Bradley Meego, this is Laurel."
LAUREL HARRIS	Hi.
BRADLEY MEEGO	Hey.
BRADLEY MEEGO	What if it rains? Do we pick another date?
CARRIE	"Doctor, you are persistent."
CARRIE	"All right. In case of emergency, only."
BRADLEY MEEGO	"Now I'm gonna have to buy the book. Nice meeting you. You, too."
CARRIE	Drive safe.
LAUREL HARRIS	"My God, he is such a fox."
LAUREL HARRIS	Did you just meet him when I was at the bar?
LAUREL HARRIS	"Lady, you've got it going on!"
CARRIE	That Saturday turned out to be hot and sunny.
CARRIE	While we sat under our umbrella...
CARRIE	...twenty-something girls sizzled on the sand like rotisserie chickens.
SAMANTHA	"Excuse me, when did tanning come back in style?"
SAMANTHA	Hand me the 45!
IRANDA	"Forty-five, I didn't know it went up that high."
CARRIE	You could sit in a microwave and not burn.
SAMANTHA	"It's Charlotte's, but I don't think she's gonnal be using it."
SAMANTHA	It's not good for her 27-year-old image.
SAMANTHA	She actually put on oil.
IRANDA	Just let her have her fun now.
IRANDA	"Come Labor Day, she's gonna look like a 27-year-old handbag."
SAMANTHA	I'd risk a few precancerous freckles for a summer romance.
CARRIE	"And right then, my summer romance made his appearance, right on schedule."
BRADLEY MEEGO	Yellow umbrellas seem to be very popular this year.
CARRIE	This is Dr. Bradley Meego.
SAMANTHA	"Hello. What kind of a doctor are you, Doctor?"
BRADLEY MEEGO	"Internal medicine. General, all-purpose kind of thing."
SAMANTHA	"Fabulous, so you can prescribe medication?"
BRADLEY MEEGO	-What'd you have in mind?
CARRIE	feel free to ignore her.
BRADLEY MEEGO	I'm sure that's impossible. I'm gonna go take a quick dip.
BRADLEY MEEGO	"You promise not to ditch me, now."
CARRIE	I Promise.
BRADLEY MEEGO	is That the guy from the book party?
CARRIE	Yeah.
SAMANTHA	I've got to start reading.
CARRIE	He's cute. I'm just not really sure I'm interested.
SAMANTHA	"Good-looking, polite, house in the Hamptons."
IRANDA	-It's good on paper.
SAMANTHA	"You know the rule. good on paper, bad in bed."
CARRIE	A'good on paper guy' is a guy with great credentials...
CARRIE	...who you always end up leaving for some hot guy...
CARRIE	...who rides a motorcycle and doesn't have a checking account.
CHARLOTTE	My God!
CHARLOTTE	The water feels so awesome. You guys should really go in.
CARRIE	"You better put on some sunscreen, Georgette Hamilton."
CHARLOTTE	"That's okay, I never burn."
IRANDA	"Well, I do. In fact, I've had enough for today."
IRANDA	I'm gonna go grocery shopping. You guys want anything?
CHARLOTTE	We should get some rum. We can make Long Island Iced Teas.
GREG	"Yes, I love Long Island Iced Teas."
IRANDA	Excellent!
BRADLEY MEEGO	I took a leap of faith and made reservations...
BRADLEY MEEGO	...at one of those impossible-to-get-into restaurants for tonight.
CARRIE	I'd love to...I just can't abandon my friends.
BRADLEY MEEGO	"Actually, that wasn't an invitation. It was just restaurant chitchat."
BRADLEY MEEGO	I'm kidding. How about after dinner?
BRADLEY MEEGO	"I've got a great little house, cute porch we could sit on."
CARRIE	I don't know.
BRADLEY MEEGO	"Okay, how about I just call your..."
BRADLEY MEEGO	...in-case-of-emergency number this weekend.
BRADLEY MEEGO	"The emergency being, I think I'm gonna miss you."
CARRIE	"Yes, you could definitely do that."
BRADLEY MEEGO	Good.
CARRIE	"Romantic, polite, and his very own house south of the highway."
CARRIE	My good-on-paper guy was jumping right off the page.
CARRIE	"Later that afternoon, we came back from the beach rested, rejuvenated..."
CARRIE	...feeling almost 29 again.
CARRIE	Even Miranda was in good spirits.
IRANDA	"Guys, I just got back from the market. Fresh corn and seafood for dinner."
IRANDA	"Except, your groupie can't stay. I only got enough for the four of us."
CARRIE	She's here?
IRANDA	"Yeah, she was asking too many inane questions. I sent her up to your room."
CARRIE	Thanks.
IRANDA	Sorry.
CHARLOTTE	"I've got to go shower, the sand is itchy in my bathing suit, and then I'm gonna help you."
IRANDA	"Take your time. Samantha, that came for you."
SAMANTHA	My God!
IRANDA	What's wrong?
SAMANTHA	It's for the Hamptons Hoedown tomorrow night...
SAMANTHA	...and the event is being run by Nina G. Public Relations. Nina G.!
CARRIE	"Overnight, Samantha's ex-assistant, Nina Grabowski..."
CARRIE	...had reinvented herself as Nina G.
SAMANTHA	I was up for that job and now she's using my Rolodex to put together the guest list.
CARRIE	While Samantha was getting fucked royally by her protege...
CARRIE	...mine was giving me the royal treatment.
LAUREL HARRIS	It's not that I don't wanna have sex with men...
LAUREL HARRIS	...I feel like these previous generations of women have...
LAUREL HARRIS	...devalued sex to the point where it's not even special anymore.
LAUREL HARRIS	"One summer, when I was 15, I read everything Jackie Collins ever wrote."
LAUREL HARRIS	"I thought to myself, who cares? Is it supposed to be shocking..."
LAUREL HARRIS	...wagging one's pussy at every good-looking stud who walks by?
LAUREL HARRIS	please.
CARRIE	and What is It You like about my column?
CHARLOTTE	"I have a tiny tick on my stomach, and I can't get it off."
CARRIE	Does It hurt?
CHARLOTTE	"No, But It itches."
LAUREL HARRIS	"My God, that is not a tick."
CHARLOTTE	What is it?
SAMANTHA	There go our shitty sheets.
CHARLOTTE	"My God, it's so disgusting."
IRANDA	-Where's she going?
CARRIE	to the drugstore.
CARRIE	Charlotte really is in her 20s. She's got crabs.
SAMANTHA	My God!
CARRIE	"That night, I called Dr. Meego. I figured it was an emergency."
CARRIE	I have this thing about crabs.
CARRIE	I had them once in college and the experience scarred me for life.
CARRIE	I really I don't think I can go back to that house until the mattresses are sanitized...
CARRIE	...and the sheets and towels are burned.
BRADLEY MEEGO	I'm flattered you thought of me.
BRADLEY MEEGO	I'd be happy to prescribe your friend some industrial-strength pubicide.
CARRIE	That's all right. She can take care of herself.
CARRIE	Cheers.
BRADLEY MEEGO	You might have to spend the night here. You know.
CARRIE	"I might have to, but only to sleep."
BRADLEY MEEGO	Women always say that and as soon as the lights go out...
BRADLEY MEEGO	"...boom, they're going right for my pajamas."
CARRIE	"All righty. I promise, no funny stuff."
CARRIE	"That night we slept together, but we didn't sleep together."
CARRIE	It was really nice.
CARRIE	I believe it was the first instance of a case of crabs moving a relationship forward.
CARRIE	"Every year, one of the local Hamptons billionaires got down and dirty..."
CARRIE	...and threw a big hoedown full of cowboys and caviar.
CARRIE	It was the event of the season.
CARRIE	We joined Samantha to lend our moral support.
SAMANTHA	I can't believe it.
SAMANTHA	There're people here who don't even come to my parties and they came to Nina's.
SAMANTHA	Look at her over there.
WAITER	Beef jerky carpaccio?
SAMANTHA	I am just so depressed right now. Excuse me.
CARRIE	Where are you going?
SAMANTHA	To congratulate Nina. I may need her to hire me someday.
CARRIE	While Samantha set out to negotiate twenty-something detente...
CARRIE	...Charlotte prepared to launch a full-out war.
CHARLOTTE	Excuse me. Do you know that you gave me crabs?
GREG	what?
CHARLOTTE	You heard me.
GREG	What makes You think It was me?
CHARLOTTE	That is So tacky.
GREG	So is Iying about your age.
GREG	I saw your driver license when you bought the beer last night.
CHARLOTTE	"I didn't lie. You made an assumption, I didn't contradict it."
GREG	"Whatever. I may have given you crabs, but you deceived me."
GREG	That is So much worse.
CHARLOTTE	Grow up.
NINA GRABOWSKI	"You are a waitperson. That doesn't mean wait, it means go!"
SAMANTHA	Nina!
NINA GRABOWSKI	"My God, you actually came."
SAMANTHA	I just stopped by to wish you good luck. It's a fabulous party.
NINA GRABOWSKI	That is very cool of you.
AN IN COWBOY COSTUME	I told you not to seat Martha near the hayride. She's allergic.
AN IN COWBOY COSTUME	Could you please try to keep the young people out until after 11:00.
WAITRESS	"We're all out of country-fried goat cheese, somebody got stuck with a cactus needle..."
WAITRESS	...and there are people outside who aren't on the fucking list.
NINA GRABOWSKI	Jesus fucking Christ. You are totally coked out.
WAITRESS	You are totally jealous.
NINA GRABOWSKI	"My God, what is that?"
NINA GRABOWSKI	What is that sound? My God! What's happening?
NINA GRABOWSKI	That's not supposed to happen until midnight.
WAITRESS	I know.
NINA GRABOWSKI	-This is your problem. Get them to stop!
WAITRESS	"I can't, they're on a fucking barge!"
NINA GRABOWSKI	Could you help me? I need to get everybody outside.
NINA GRABOWSKI	I'm totally fucked right now.
SAMANTHA	"Okay, people, fiesta fireworks, outside! Let's go!"
SAMANTHA	This is Greg. I think the two of you would really hit it off.
NINA GRABOWSKI	Hi.
CARRIE	"I began to realize, that the biggest threat twenty-something girls posed..."
CARRIE	...was to themselves.
LAUREL HARRIS	I've been looking all over for you.
LAUREL HARRIS	"look, I got one Just like yours."
CARRIE	-That's great.
LAUREL HARRIS	You want me to get you a Cosmopolitan?
CARRIE	"No. I'm gonna go find my date. But I'll see you later, okay?"
LAUREL HARRIS	"That guy from the bookstore? My God, he was so cute."
CARRIE	"Annoying, yes. Dangerous, no."
CARRIE	They were simply our youthful doppelgangers...
CARRIE	...who needed our compassion more than anything.
CARRIE	And then everything I so firmly believed was promptly blown to pieces.
CARRIE	Is it you?
BIG	Hey. What are you doing here?
CARRIE	What am I doing here? What are you doing here?
BIG	I just got back this week from Paris.
BIG	This is Natasha.
NATASHA	Hi. It's a pleasure to meet you. I've heard so much about you.
CARRIE	Really?
BIG	Natasha's parents have a house in East Hampton. We just came up for the weekend.
NATASHA	Excuse me. It's nice to meet you.
CARRIE	"I'm sorry, I'm just a little stunned here. And confused."
CARRIE	Who is she?
BIG	I meant to call you. She's this girl that I met in Paris.
BIG	She works for Ralph Lauren in Europe.
CARRIE	You're in from Paris for the weekends?
BIG	No. The Paris deal fell through. I planned on calling you.
BIG	I certainly didn't want to run into you like this.
CARRIE	You can't plan everything. Life can be pretty random.
CARRIE	"I'm here on a date, too, somewhere. He's a doctor, Bradley Meego."
CARRIE	"He's good on paper, probably like Natasha. Good-looking, sweet, blah-blah-blah."
CARRIE	"How old is she, anyway?"
BIG	"I don't know, 26, 27."
CARRIE	Something like that.
CARRIE	I'll see you in the Hamptons or back in the city.
BIG	I promise to call when I get back into town.
IRANDA	"Carrie, are you okay?"
CARRIE	"No, I just ran into Big. He's back from Paris."
CARRIE	He has a new girlfriend. She's 26.
IRANDA	-Where is he? I didn't see-
IRANDA	god.
CARRIE	And then I realized...
CARRIE	...twenty-something girls are just fabulous...
CARRIE	...until you see one with the man who broke your heart.
CARRIE	Life is all about making choices.
CARRIE	"Some choices, like who you marry, are big..."
CARRIE	...while others are even bigger.
CARRIE	What do you think?
CARRIE	"The $5 ones that last three days, or the $10 ones that last five days?"
IRANDA	Either one.
CARRIE	Three days.
FLOWER VENDOR	-5
CARRIE	Another choice is how to deal with an ex-boyfriend.
CARRIE	"Some women handle it coolly, calmly, while others...."
IRANDA	Fuck! Steve. Go!
FLOWER VENDOR	$5! Come back here!
IRANDA	He just looked so hurt. Like a kid in one of those big-eyed velvet paintings.
CHARLOTTE	Poor Steve.
IRANDA	"I'm sorry, I panicked. What was I gonna do, stand around and chit-chat about the weather?"
IRANDA	"-The man's been inside me, for god's sake."
CHARLOTTE	Could I have more Sweet'n Low?
IRANDA	I've never been able to be friends with an ex-boyfriend.
IRANDA	"I meet those couples who stay friends and I think, 'How do they do that?'"
SAMANTHA	I've never been able to be friends with any men. Why would I?
SAMANTHA	"Women are for friendships, men are for fucking."
CARRIE	"Honey, you gotta learn to form an opinion."
CHARLOTTE	"Friendship is the bonus of a relationship. If they don't want relationship, they don't get to be friends."
CARRIE	"So what? If you don't make it a couple, you withhold friendship as a punishment?"
CHARLOTTE	You make it sound so bad.
SAMANTHA	Black widow spiders bite the heads off their mates when they're still with them.
SAMANTHA	Withholding friendship is letting them off easy.
CARRIE	"How can you imagine you guys, instead of the whole awful break-up scene..."
CARRIE	"...just like you say, 'hey, you, come here'...and chomp their head off."
IRANDA	Believe me. I would love to be one of those people who's all:
IRANDA	"We loved, thank you. You enriched my life. Now, go, prosper.'"
IRANDA	"But I'm much more: 'We didn't work out, you need to not exist.' What?"
CARRIE	"It's just so childish. Not you, the whole situation."
CARRIE	"I mean, we keep dresses we'll never wear again but we throw away our ex-boyfriends."
CARRIE	I'm not saying that I'm any better.
CARRIE	"I haven't been able to be friends with Big, but...."
CARRIE	If you loved someone and you break up...where does the love go?
SAMANTHA	To their next girlfriend.
CARRIE	No. That is a different love.
CARRIE	There is no way the love that I had with Big is same thing he has with Natasha.
IRANDA	Natasha? When'd you stop calling her the Idiot Stick Figure With No Soul?
CARRIE	About three weeks ago when I saw them at Cafe M.
CARRIE	He was holding her hand and smiling and...I finally got it.
CARRIE	"They're happy, slash, we're over. It was okay."
SAMANTHA	"Natasha, What a bullshit name."
IRANDA	Totally.
CHARLOTTE	Stupid.
CARRIE	Complete bullshit.
CARRIE	"Later that night, I got to thinking about the ex factor."
CARRIE	"In mathematics, we learned that 'x' stands for the unknown."
CARRIE	a' plus 'b' equals 'x.'
CARRIE	But what's really unknown is: what plus what equals friendship with an ex?
CARRIE	Is this an unsolvable equation?
CARRIE	Or is it possible to transform a once-passionate love...
CARRIE	...into something that fits nice and easily onto the friendship shelf?
CARRIE	I couldn't help but wonder...can you be friends with an ex?
CARRIE	"That Sunday afternoon, Miranda was sitting at home enjoying a biscotti and the paper when..."
CARRIE	There it was...her ex's head.
STEVE	I hear you breathing.
IRANDA	Yeah. Hi!
STEVE	"That was a shitty thing you did, running away from me on the street."
IRANDA	I didn't run.
STEVE	You ran.
IRANDA	I wasn't expecting to see you...
STEVE	It really hurt my feelings.
IRANDA	I don't do very well with ex-boyfriends and...
STEVE	This is me. Steve. I held your head while you were sleeping.
IRANDA	I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
STEVE	It's okay.
IRANDA	I hadn't seen you in so long and I missed you and then I did that shitty thing.
STEVE	-It wasn't that shitty.
IRANDA	It was.
IRANDA	It was a shitty thing. I'm a shitty person.
STEVE	You are not a shitty person.
IRANDA	-I am! I am shitty! You'd never do anything that shitty.
STEVE	How do you call showing up at your apartment in the middle of afternoon and calling you shitty?
IRANDA	"Yeah, that was pretty shitty."
STEVE	You've got a 'bat in the cave.'
IRANDA	"I miss you. Whenever something funny happens, I always want to tell you about it."
STEVE	"So tell me. Just 'cause we could make it a couple doesn't mean we can't have a friendly meal, does it?"
IRANDA	I guess not.
STEVE	What are you doing Friday?
IRANDA	I have a date.
STEVE	"Looking forward to it, are you?"
CARRIE	As Miranda made plans to have dinner with her last love...
CARRIE	"...Charlotte came face to face with the memory of her first...her horse, Taddy."
CARRIE	Charlotte's relationship with Taddy ended sadly...
CARRIE	...when he threw her during a teen equestrian competition...
CARRIE	...causing her to break her collarbone and lose the blue ribbon.
CARRIE	Her father promptly sold Taddy to another family and she hadn't been on a horse since.
CARRIE	Charlotte wondered if it was time to get back in the saddle again.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, across town...Samantha was about to see a stallion of her own."
R. COCKY	"I gotta tell you, you look amazing."
SAMANTHA	"Excuse me, but do I know you?"
R. COCKY	Not yet. I was thinking maybe you'd have dinner with me sometime.
SAMANTHA	What makes you think that?
R. COCKY	The way you were just checking me out.
SAMANTHA	You get 10 points for directness.
R. COCKY	Do I also get your phone number?
SAMANTHA	I'm not sure yet.
R. COCKY	I'll tell you what...Here's my business card. You call me.
SAMANTHA	Blatantly picking a woman up on the street. How'd you get to be so cocky?
R. COCKY	"I was born that way, I guess."
R. COCKY	At least consider meeting me for a friendly little drink.
SAMANTHA	"I'll think about it, Mr. Cocky."
R. COCKY	Please do.
CARRIE	"It was later that week, when I spotted a Laura Ashley dress, circa 1988..."
CARRIE	...still hanging in my closet...
CARRIE	...that I decided it was time to give my ex a friendly phone call.
CARRIE	I hadn't planned on the Idiot Stick Figure With No Soul answering.
CARRIE	"Then, I remembered Big had caller ID."
CARRIE	Shit!
BIG	Hello?
CARRIE	Hello yourself.
BIG	did You Just call?
CARRIE	"No. Yes, but I didn't get to talk because..."
CARRIE	"...I accidentally hit the thing...so, you know, it hung up."
CARRIE	"So, yes. And I...I heard Natasha, so, apologize to her. How is Natasha?"
BIG	Great. She's great. How are you?
CARRIE	I'm A-OK.
BIG	You sound a little nuts.
CARRIE	Can't you let one go by? This is weird. The first call.
BIG	Right.
CARRIE	Maybe I'd...do better if I went with my little prepared speech.
BIG	"You have a speech, do you?"
CARRIE	I was wondering what you thought of...
CARRIE	...instead of pretending each other doesn't exist...
CARRIE	...we try to be friends or something?
BIG	I'd like that.
BIG	"I've been meaning to call you, but I didn't know if you wanted to hear from me--"
CARRIE	want to have a lunch Or something?
BIG	-Let's have a lunch.
CARRIE	Thank you.
CARRIE	I have a 1:00 reservation. Bradshaw.
CARRIE	I used to make our lunch reservations in Big's name.
CARRIE	"But today, I put it in mine, because that's what friends do."
HOSTESS	The other party is already here.
CARRIE	Thank you.
BIG	Are you hungry? Because I am hungry.
BIG	"I got up at 6:00, worked out, hardly had any breakfast."
BIG	They have a great Cobb salad here. What would you say? Shall we eat?
CARRIE	-Let's eat.
BIG	-We'll eat.
CARRIE	"And that's when I realized, Big was nervous."
CARRIE	It was odd. The new 'friend' part of me felt incredibly compassionate...
CARRIE	...while the old 'girlfriend' part of me felt incredibly smug.
CARRIE	You okay?
BIG	Fine.
CARRIE	You look good.
BIG	"Thank you, so do you."
WAITER	Good afternoon.
BIG	The Cobb salad is very good here.
WAITER	Can I get you something to drink?
CARRIE	Iced tea.
BIG	A mineral water.
BIG	Scotch.
CARRIE	Cosmopolitan.
CARRIE	"An hour later, I had solved the unsolvable friendship equation."
CARRIE	It seems the answer is this:
CARRIE	Cosmopolitans plus scotch equals friendship with an ex.
CARRIE	And what about your music?
CARRIE	"If I had to listen to freaking Blood, Sweat & Tears one more time...."
BIG	"Blood, Sweat & Tears is Great stuff."
CARRIE	-10 minutes after we're awake?
CARRIE	Tell me about the girl.
BIG	Really?
CARRIE	friends talk about Their relationships.
CARRIE	"Go ahead, friend, tell me about the girl."
BIG	-She's very sweet-
CARRIE	"-Okay, enough! Don't tell me about the girl. No can do."
CARRIE	Maybe we should make a pact:
CARRIE	We don't talk about our relationships until they get really serious something.
BIG	It is serious. We're engaged. I wanted you to hear it from me.
CARRIE	I just got a splitting headache.
BIG	I didn't know how to tell you...
BIG	-When you called for lunch-
CARRIE	Engaged?
CARRIE	"How can you be engaged? You have a problem with commitment, remember?"
CARRIE	"In fact, you told me you never wanted to get married again, ever."
BIG	Things change.
CARRIE	You just didn't want to marry me.
BIG	-Natasha and I-
CARRIE	-Don't say her name! Don't you dare say her name to me!
CARRIE	You string me along for two years...
CARRIE	...then you marry some 25-year-old girl after only five months?
BIG	I did not string You along.
CARRIE	"-Fine, that's right. You didn't string me along."
CARRIE	You know what? I have to go. I have a headache.
DINER	are You okay?
CARRIE	-I'm fine.
CARRIE	Don't help me! Don't you help me!
BIG	"Carrie, hold on, wait."
CARRIE	What is it?
BIG	-Don't end it like this-
CARRIE	You are the one end It like this. I was trying to be friendly.
CARRIE	This seems like a much better way to end things.
CARRIE	"Go. Be engaged, get married to...Nijinsky or whatever her name is. Have a nice life."
CARRIE	"Don't worry about me, I'm fine."
CARRIE	These steps are very dangerous.
CARRIE	"The next day, I had promised to hold Charlotte's hand while she attempted to go riding."
CARRIE	"It turned out, she needed to hold mine as well."
CARRIE	How are you doing?
CARRIE	Aside from the fact that my ex is engaged to a teenager...
CARRIE	...and I've got horseshit on my $300 goddamn shoes...I'm doing okay.
CHARLOTTE	I think you're amazing. I would be in a hospital or something.
CARRIE	What the fuck is his problem?
CHARLOTTE	He's got a stubborn streak.
CHARLOTTE	Some horses never really like to be ridden.
CHARLOTTE	"Taddy was like that when I first got him, but once I broke him in, he loved it."
CARRIE	You know what? I broke in Big. I did.
CARRIE	I broke him in and the Idiot Stick Figure With No Soul gets to ride him.
CHARLOTTE	I'm really sorry.
CARRIE	I know you are. Thanks.
CARRIE	"Damn! You see, this is what happens."
CARRIE	You try to be friendly with an ex and you wind up knee-deep in shit! Perfect.
HORSE WRANGLER	Here you go. This is Pal. He's a good boy.
CHARLOTTE	"He's brown. Taddy was brown, but he had white spots on his flank."
CHARLOTTE	"Just stay till I'm on the horse, then you can go, okay?"
CARRIE	"I'm here, it's all lovely. Go have fun."
CHARLOTTE	"Hey, Pal."
HORSE WRANGLER	Here you go! Foot in and up you go.
CARRIE	As Charlotte placed her boot in the stirrup...
CARRIE	"...all her bad memories of Taddy, broken bones and ribbons flooded over her."
CHARLOTTE	No! Can't.
CHARLOTTE	"-No, I can't. Let's go."
CARRIE	You Just paid.
CHARLOTTE	"-I said, I can't!"
HORSE WRANGLER	-He's all saddled up.
CARRIE	After a few 'get to know each other' phone calls...
CARRIE	...Samantha took up Mr. Cocky on his offer of a friendly drink.
CARRIE	"Turns out, it was a very friendly drink."
SAMANTHA	"I want you to know, I never pick up guys on the street...unless they're very cute."
R. COCKY	"Get over here, you cutie you."
R. COCKY	Before we go any further...I gotta warn you about something.
SAMANTHA	Warn me about what?
R. COCKY	I'm very well-endowed.
SAMANTHA	Jackpot.
R. COCKY	No. I'm serious. It's huge. Most women just can't handle it.
SAMANTHA	I'm not most women. Unzip and get over here.
CARRIE	Samantha suddenly understood what made Mr. Cocky so cocky.
SAMANTHA	"I'm telling you, it was like a wall of flesh coming at me."
CARRIE	Nothing is scarier than a really big one coming at you.
SAMANTHA	"I didn't even want my mouth near it, I was afraid I'd get lockjaw."
SAMANTHA	It was quite a shock. His hands are relatively tiny.
CARRIE	-Don't tell me you believe that.
SAMANTHA	not anymore.
SAMANTHA	I'm really going to have to psych myself up before I try it again.
CARRIE	You're going to try it again? Why?
SAMANTHA	-Because it's there.
CARRIE	"-It's a penis, not Mount Everest."
SAMANTHA	Let me tell you. If it was Mount Everest...
SAMANTHA	...Last night I could only make it to Base Camp One.
SAMANTHA	"You dated Big, I'm dating Mr. Too Big."
CARRIE	You're unbelievable.
CARRIE	"You broke up with James because he was too small, this guy is too big."
CARRIE	"Who are you, Goldicocks?"
SAMANTHA	Yep. I'm looking for one that's just right.
CARRIE	"That night, after a friendly dinner..."
CARRIE	...Steve and Miranda began to explore their newfound friendship.
IRANDA	"If you were a real friend, you'd let me keep it."
STEVE	"Sorry, it's one of the conditions of our break-up. You gotta give me back my fire department shirt."
IRANDA	It fits me perfectly
STEVE	Tell it to the judge.
IRANDA	Please?
STEVE	Nope.
STEVE	Thanks for coming out for dinner.
IRANDA	"Thanks for letting me pay, finally."
STEVE	"That's what friends do, isn't it? Goodnight."
STEVE	"That's what friends do, isn't it? I got another question for you."
STEVE	Do friends kiss...here?
IRANDA	No.
STEVE	Do friends kiss here?
IRANDA	No.
STEVE	Do friends kiss...
IRANDA	Yeah.
STEVE	"We had good reasons for breaking up, right?"
IRANDA	"Yeah. Money, schedules, goals."
STEVE	Good reasons. What now? Are we still just friends?
IRANDA	"Yeah, we're still just friends. Friends who have sex."
CARRIE	And in a bed across town....
R. COCKY	Ready?
SAMANTHA	Wait. Wait.
CARRIE	After two yoga classes and a hit of the best Hawaiian gold she could find...
CARRIE	...Samantha was ready to take another run at Mount Everest.
SAMANTHA	"Okay, here we go. Nice and easy."
R. COCKY	That's it.
SAMANTHA	Easy...Easy. Good. Good.
R. COCKY	"Okay, here we go."
SAMANTHA	Here we go?
R. COCKY	Yeah.
SAMANTHA	You mean we're not there yet?
R. COCKY	no.
SAMANTHA	"Okay, stop. Whoa, boy. can we Just be friends?"
CARRIE	"And just like that, Samantha made her very first male friend."
CARRIE	"The next day in Central Park, Charlotte was making a new friend as well."
CHARLOTTE	"Good, Pal."
CARRIE	She had decided she and Pal were moving too fast.
CARRIE	"Before going any further, they needed to slow down and get to know each other better."
CHARLOTTE	"You're a good boy, Pal. Does that feel good?"
CHARLOTTE	"You like that? My Taddy liked that, too."
CHARLOTTE	"I loved my Taddy so much. Oh, good boy."
CARRIE	And with that gentle nudge from her new pal...
CARRIE	...all Charlotte's bad feelings about Taddy lifted...
CARRIE	...and she remembered just how much she had loved his cute white spots.
CHARLOTTE	"Easy. Okay. Go, boy, go!"
CARRIE	"Hey, it's Carrie, I'm shoe shopping."
BIG	"It's me, are you there? Pick up if you're there. You're not there."
BIG	I'm calling to say I feel bad about last week.
BIG	I didn't mean for it to happen like that...I thought you needed to know.
BIG	I hated the idea someone else might tell you.
CARRIE	Christ. I feel like a real shit. I'm sorry.
BIG	I'm really sorry...I would never hurt you deliberately.
CARRIE	I know you wouldn't.
BIG	-You're there?
CARRIE	-I'm here.
BIG	"Like I was saying, I'm sorry."
CARRIE	"I'm sorry, too. I shouldn't have reacted like that. It was such a shock."
CARRIE	I guess it was a shock I needed to hear to move on.
BIG	Yeah.
CARRIE	I wish you all the best. I do. I hope you and Natasha will be very happy.
BIG	Do you mean that?
CARRIE	No. But I will.
CARRIE	Really. I hope...some day very soon...we can all meet for a drink and be great friends.
CARRIE	Like they do in the movies. Bye.
BIG	Bye.
CARRIE	"And I actually managed to hold onto those friendly feelings, until...."
CARRIE	I can't believe my ex-boyfriend is 6 blocks away at the Plaza right now...
CARRIE	...having an engagement brunch.
CHARLOTTE	I can't believe he had the nerve to invite you.
CARRIE	It's my own fault. I had to make the big 'let's be friends' speech.
CARRIE	"Who am I kidding? Big and I were never friends, we were something else."
CARRIE	Something that apparently did not end with an engagement party at the Plaza.
SAMANTHA	do we want another round?
CARRIE	What do You think?
SAMANTHA	"Four more, please."
CARRIE	I think I can actually feel them over there eating shrimp.
CARRIE	It's just...why her? I mean really...Why her?
IRANDA	One word: Hubbell.
CHARLOTTE	Hubbell.
CARRIE	"Oh, my god. Hubbell. It is so Hubbell."
SAMANTHA	Who's Hubbell?
CARRIE	Hubbell! Robert 'Hubbell' Redford in The Way We Were.
CHARLOTTE	I love that movie.
CARRIE	"I love, love, love, that movie."
SAMANTHA	never saw it.
GROUP	"-Oh, my god!"
IRANDA	"What are you, an alien? How could you have not seen it the way we were?"
SAMANTHA	Chick film.
IRANDA	Robert Redford is madly in love with Barbara Streisand.
CARRIE	Katie. -K -K -K -Katie.
CHARLOTTE	"K-k-k-katie, right!"
IRANDA	"But he can't be with her because she's too complicated...and she has wild, curly hair."
CARRIE	Hello? C-c-c-curly.
IRANDA	He leaves her and marries this...simple girl with straight hair.
CARRIE	"Ladies, I am having an epiphany."
CARRIE	The world is made of two types of women:
CARRIE	The 'simple' girls and the 'Katie' girls.
CARRIE	I'm a 'Katie' girl and where are our drinks?
CHARLOTTE	I always cry at the last scene in that movie...
CHARLOTTE	...when she sees him in her hotel with his new wife--
CARRIE	the simple girl.
CHARLOTTE	-And she reaches up-
CARRIE	and smoothes his hair away.
IRANDA	"She says to him: Your girl is lovely, Hubbell.'"
CHARLOTTE	Then the music comes in.
CARRIE	Memories'
IRANDA	"Oh my, God, it's so good."
CARRIE	Light the corners of my mind
GROUP	Misty water-colored memories
GROUP	Of the way we were'
IRANDA	Let me do my favorite part.
IRANDA	-'Can it be' -Yes!
GROUP	Can it be that it was all so simple then
GROUP	Or has time re-written every line?
GROUP	If we had the chance to do it all again
GROUP	Tell me
GROUP	Would we?
CARRIE	Could we?
GROUP	Memories'
SAMANTHA	I miss James.
CARRIE	Excuse me?
CARRIE	"After I left my friends, I found myself pulled to the site of the Big engagement party."
CARRIE	"I had no intention of going in, but it was on my way home."
BIG	One second.
CARRIE	I had a choice.
CARRIE	I could run or I could stand and ask him the question...
CARRIE	"...that if I didn't ask, would haunt me the rest of my life."
BIG	"I thought by the time I got here, I'd know what to say."
BIG	And?
BIG	You're late. The party's over.
CARRIE	I'll say it is.
BIG	Funny.
CARRIE	I was just on my way home and...I have a question for you.
CARRIE	Why wasn't it me?
BIG	-Carrie-
CARRIE	"No, seriously. I really need to Hear You say it. come on, be a friend."
BIG	I don't know. It just got so hard...and she's...
CARRIE	"Yeah. Your girl is lovely, Hubbell.'"
BIG	I don't get it.
CARRIE	And you never did.
HORSE CARRIAGE DRIVER	"Easy, girl."
CARRIE	"Then I had a thought, maybe I didn't break Big."
CARRIE	Maybe the problem was he couldn't break me.
CARRIE	Maybe some women aren't meant to be tamed.
CARRIE	Maybe they need to run free until they find someone...just as wild to run with.
CARRIE	New York City.
CARRIE	"Home to one million exciting, eligible, single men and four cold and slightly cranky single women."
IRANDA	"Well, this is good."
IRANDA	We're actually crossing water to meet men.
CARRIE	"Reminder, I am not going to Staten lsland to meet men."
CARRIE	I am going to judge them.
CARRIE	A perk of being a minor celebrity is that you get invited to major events.
CARRIE	Like NewYork fire department's annual calendar competition.
CHARLOTTE	This is a long way to go to watch some firemen take their shirts off.
SAMANTHA	I'm on the ferry.
SAMANTHA	I better see more than pecs.
CHARLOTTE	I'm freezing! I don't understand why they couldn't hold the competition in a bar in Manhattan.
CHARLOTTE	They have firemen on the Upper East Side too.
CARRIE	And they only put out top-notch fires.
CHARLOTTE	Look at how small it looks.
IRANDA	Who would have thought an island that tiny would be big enough to hold all our old boyfriends.
C	He loves to cook and can whip up a great baked ziti.
C	"He's from engine 275, ladder 133, way out there in Queens."
BILL KELLEY	is he hot?
CARRIE	He's a six.
BILL KELLEY	on a scale of how many?
CARRIE	His name was Bill Kelley.
CARRIE	"He was a divorced politician, campaigning for New York City Comptroller."
CARRIE	And the token male judge.
CARRIE	Watch the firemen.
BILL KELLEY	I'm more into cops.
C	He's a dancer and married.
C	"Sorry, ladies."
C	His wife Maria said he's a good guy but he works too hard.
C	Work that belly!
SAMANTHA	"Ladies, over here."
IRANDA	"oK, they don't make cosmopolitans, it's a Staten lsland iced tea."
SAMANTHA	is That like a long lsland iced tea? - I think so.
IRANDA	I think so.
IRANDA	"Hello, I'm drunk."
CHARLOTTE	Do we have to be this close? It's embarrassing.
SAMANTHA	You gotta be in It to win it.
CHARLOTTE	I'm moving back.
IRANDA	I can't see the cute firemen from back there without my glasses.
CHARLOTTE	Why do you even care? You have Steve.
IRANDA	I do not have Steve.
IRANDA	"There is no having of the Steve, we're just friends."
SAMANTHA	We're just friends.
SAMANTHA	I don't put my dick in you.
IRANDA	Another one of these and I might let you.
CHARLOTTE	There are no datable men here.
IRANDA	"What was your first clue? The pleather jackets or smell of ""High Karate""? Ladies, this is Ricky Fantucchi."
C	He's a Capricorn.
C	His uncles are firefighters.
C	"Yes, ladies, that's a cheetah on his arm."
C	Ricky represents engine 53 in Lower Manhattan.
SAMANTHA	I'd like to show him my Lower Manhattan.
SAMANTHA	"Look at his arms, they're huge."
IRANDA	You knowwhat they say.
IRANDA	Big armsbig arms.
SAMANTHA	"Hello, 911."
SAMANTHA	I'm on fire.
CARRIE	"After the contest, I began to realize that Staten lsland was like a quaint European country."
CARRIE	The American music was 20 years behind and you could smoke wherever you wanted.
SAMANTHA	Hi.
SAMANTHA	Are those shirts are for sale? I'd like to get one for my nephew.
RICKY	"Yeah, you could buy'em."
RICKY	But I don't knowwhere.
RICKY	"I got this one at work, but I'm sure you could buy 'em at other places."
RICKY	I've seen them in those shops -
SAMANTHA	Samantha.
RICKY	"Ricky, how are you doing?"
SAMANTHA	Good.
SAMANTHA	How are you doing?.
SAMANTHA	I sawyou up There
RICKY	I sawyou too.
SAMANTHA	You looked fantastic.
RICKY	Yeah? I never did Anything like that.
RICKY	"My sisters said, ""Do it, Ricky""."
RICKY	"And I said, ""l never did anything like that before""."
SAMANTHA	You did it very well.
SAMANTHA	I wonder what month you'll be.
RICKY	Maybe october.
RICKY	my birthday is in october.
SAMANTHA	"I bet July, or any month that's hot."
CARRIE	"Two songs later, it was time for this dancing queen to take a breather."

CARRIE	Sure.
CARRIE	"And by the way, you have the worst taste in men -ever."
BILL KELLEY	No way.
CARRIE	You gave that guy from Midtown a 7.
BILL KELLEY	I like a firefighter with love handles to hold on to when escaping a burning building.
CARRIE	You got a point there.
BILL KELLEY	But You were tough.
BILL KELLEY	And what's with the half-points?
CARRIE	What can I say? Sometimes a girl needs a half.
BILL KELLEY	"So, which district do you vote in?"
CARRIE	Whichever one is near Barneys.
BILL KELLEY	You've never voted in New York City?
CARRIE	"Correct, Mr."
CARRIE	President.
BILL KELLEY	What's your address? official government purposes.
BILL KELLEY	I can Tell You your district.

BILL KELLEY	District 23.
BILL KELLEY	Same as mine.
BILL KELLEY	I'm at Madison and 82nd.
CARRIE	Fancy.
CARRIE	I thought all honest politicians lived in studios and ate beans out of a can.
BILL KELLEY	I'm not a fan of beans.
BILL KELLEY	Can I get your phone number? Government purposes only.
CARRIE	I'm just here with my friends having a good time.
CARRIE	I'm not into dating right now.
BILL KELLEY	"What, bad break -up? That was a long silence."
CARRIE	"Actually, it was a silence and a half."
BILL KELLEY	Have dinner with me.
BILL KELLEY	Would it help if I took my shirt off?
CARRIE	Time to go.
CARRIE	Politician's hitting on me.
IRANDA	and is That a bad thing?
CARRIE	"He's just way too ""I'm the guy""."
IRANDA	Are you sure? He's pretty cute.
CARRIE	I don't want to have to tell you this.
CARRIE	I saw him give someone a thumbs up.
IRANDA	We're out of here.
IRANDA	Samantha went home with that firefighter.
CARRIE	"Toot Toot, beep beep."
IRANDA	And Charlotte's around somewhere.
CARRIE	how many cocktails did she have?
IRANDA	"a couple, Why?"
CARRIE	"And so, three girls headed home, taking only fond memories of Staten lsland and its infamous iced teas."
CARRIE	"Honey, close up, it's cold."
CARRIE	are You gonna help?
IRANDA	I held her head in the taxi.
CHARLOTTE	"You're so nice, Carrie."
CHARLOTTE	"I'm nice too, aren't l?"
CARRIE	"Yes, you're nice."
CHARLOTTE	I'm nice I'm pretty and I'm smart.
CHARLOTTE	I'm a catch.
CARRIE	"Yes, you're a catch."
CARRIE	I hate you.
CHARLOTTE	You knowwhat? I'm gonna meet the perfect guy and get married.
CARRIE	"Yes, you're getting married."
CHARLOTTE	Did you hear that New York? I'm getting married this year.
CHARLOTTE	I'm getting married and here I come!
IRANDA	If she falls over I will never stop laughing.
CARRIE	I Wasn't quite sure if it Was the iced teas or the Staten lsland dating pool that broke the camel's back.
CARRIE	But something set Charlotte on fire.
CARRIE	"And uptown on dry land, Samantha and Mr."
CARRIE	July had their own fire going.
SAMANTHA	You're so big and strong.
CARRIE	"I believe the official fire department count is ""a four alarmer""."
CARRIE	"The next morning at breakfast, Miranda and I wanted poached eggs, Samantha wanted to give us the details and Charlotte wanted to keep her head from exploding over her raincoat."
SAMANTHA	"I'm telling you, no guy has ever gotten me that wet."
CARRIE	Pass the salt.
SAMANTHA	let me Tell You about his cock.
CHARLOTTE	Will you be quiet? The people at the next table have a child.
SAMANTHA	That's their choice.
CARRIE	Miss Hangover's right.
CARRIE	Can we spare the cock talk till cocktail time?
SAMANTHA	I wanted you to know my fireman was every bit the fantasy I had in mind.
IRANDA	New York's finest.
CARRIE	That's cops.
IRANDA	Whatever.
CHARLOTTE	I think it's wrong to sleep with a man just to fulfill a fantasy.
SAMANTHA	All the men we sleep with fulfill a certain fantasy.
CARRIE	or nightmare.
SAMANTHA	You fantasize of a man with a fancy apartment and a stock portfolio.
SAMANTHA	"For me, it's a fireman with a big hose."
IRANDA	Why are firemen so cute? Even when they're not that cute they're still cute.
CARRIE	"First, there's a weight limit."
CARRIE	"Second, it's the hero thing."
CARRIE	You see Him on That truck
SAMANTHA	That truck is hot.
CARRIE	hurrying to save someone trapped.
IRANDA	"They've got that ""I'm a good guy"" look in their eyes."
CHARLOTTE	It's because women want to be rescued.
CARRIE	"The sentence independent single women in their thirties are never supposed to think, let alone say out loud."
CHARLOTTE	It's true.
CHARLOTTE	"I've been dating since I was 15, where is he?"
IRANDA	Who? the white knight?
SAMANTHA	That Only happens in fairytales.
CHARLOTTE	My hair hurts.
CARRIE	Did you ever think that maybe we're the white knights and we're the ones that have to save ourselves? -
CHARLOTTE	That is so depressing.
CARRIE	is it? Later That day I got to thinking about fairytales.
CARRIE	"What if Prince Charming had never showed up? Would SnowWhite have slept in that glass coffin forever? or would she have eventually woken up, spit out the apple, gotten a job, a healthcare package and a baby from her local sperm bank? I couldn't help but wonder."
DOC	Sign here.
CARRIE	"While for some women the idea of rescue was a life raft, for Miranda it was an insult."
IRANDA	I don't need anybody to help me.
IRANDA	I'll be fine.
DOC	You'll be sedated and your vision will be blurred.
DOC	You will need someone to get you home and to bed.
DOC	"Then take two sleeping pills, sleep for 12 hours."
DOC	Wake up and you'll be able to see perfectly.
IRANDA	I can't believe I'm gonna wake up and see clearly without glasses or contacts for the first time.
DOC	Believe it.
IRANDA	They slit your eyeball open and flip up the top.
STEVE	Gross.
IRANDA	It Just flips Right up.
IRANDA	"Flip, my eye."
STEVE	"oK, stop."
IRANDA	this little blade cuts it.
IRANDA	Just Iike the top of a grape.
STEVE	It sounds pretty bad.
STEVE	You want me to come down and hold your hand?
IRANDA	I'm fine.
IRANDA	I do not need anyone to hold my hand.
STEVE	I'm not saying you need anyone.
STEVE	I'd just like to be there.
STEVE	"To help you, whatever."
STEVE	You'll need help getting home.
IRANDA	"Yeah, I'm gonna ask Carrie."
STEVE	Why do you have to ask Carrie when I'm offering?
IRANDA	"Because, you know, Carrie is my friend."
STEVE	"oK, and What am l?"
IRANDA	We haven't established that yet.
IRANDA	are You Coming up?
STEVE	? We haven't established that yet.
STEVE	"What are we doing here? I mean, are we"
IRANDA	"Steve, after they flip the eye up, these jets"
CARRIE	"And over on the East Side at a more Charlotte-friendly bar, the ice tea princess began her quest for a white knight."
CHARLOTTE	"oh, my God."
CHARLOTTE	He's so cute.
CHARLOTTE	"Cute, right?"
CARRIE	Very cute.
CARRIE	And I'm a professional.

CARRIE	She decided to take things into her own hands.
CARRIE	"Who needs a man to hold your hand, when you have cab fare and a black marker to write down emergency numbers? And while Miranda was under the knife, Charlotte was having her first glass of white wine with her white knight."

SAMANTHA	Hello? Where is everyone?
SAMANTHA	"The idea being in a firehouse filled with a calendar hot firemen, was a fantasy, Samantha felt, whose time had definitely come."
SAMANTHA	Boys!
CARRIE	This was not the firehouse fantasy Samantha had in mind.
RICKY	Samantha.
RICKY	I just put a pot of chilli on.
RICKY	"Come on, sit down."
RICKY	"Come on, get up."
RICKY	Make a move for Sam.
RICKY	I'll be right back.
SAMANTHA	Samantha's rescue fantasy was suddenly something she needed to be rescued from.
CARRIE	"It's me, leave a message."
BILL KELLY	"Hey, I'm still down here in the car."
BILL KELLY	I'll wait ten more seconds and then I'll go alone.
BILL KELLY	"Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, poor me five, four, three, two one."
BILL KELLY	"one and a half, sometimes a girl needs a half."
BILL KELLY	"oK, that was my best shot, you're not coming."

IRANDA	oK.
CARRIE	"I'm standing here, fully dressed, watching that politician guy drive off to Staten lsland without me."
CARRIE	Why?
IRANDA	You hate Staten lsland?
CARRIE	Don't think so.
CARRIE	Any other ideas? Just say it.
IRANDA	Big.
IRANDA	You're terrified of getting hurt again.
CARRIE	There it Was.
CARRIE	"The phrase single, independent women in their thirties are never supposed to think."
CARRIE	Let alone say out loud.
CARRIE	"oK, gotta go."
CARRIE	Miranda was right.
CARRIE	I was like a woman frozen on the ledge of a building on fire.
CARRIE	"I'd been so burned in my last relationship, I Was afraid to leap off into the next one."
BILL KELLY	Excuse me for a second.
BILL KELLY	Hey.
BILL KELLY	How did you get here?
CARRIE	Ferry.
BILL KELLY	All alone?
CARRIE	I'm very independent.
BILL KELLY	I can see that.
CARRIE	And this isn't a date.
CARRIE	I'm a concerned citizen.
CARRIE	A woman on my block won't pick up after her poodle.
BILL KELLY	I'll see what I can do.
BILL KELLY	Can I take your coat?
CARRIE	"And, Mr. President, it was a bad break-up."
CARRIE	So I need to take this slow.
CARRIE	"Somewhere between the chilli and half-time, Samantha decided if she wanted her firehouse fantasy to happen, she'd have to make it happen."
SAMANTHA	Up here.
SAMANTHA	Nice pole.
SAMANTHA	Wanna see it again?
RICKY	Yeah.
CARRIE	Samantha rode the pole a couple of times that night.
SAMANTHA	Why are these boots set up like this? So we'll be ready at a moment's notice.
SAMANTHA	"Well, I should be a fireman, because I am always ready to go."
RICKY	We've got a job.
RICKY	Get out of my gear.
RICKY	"Get the fuck out of my gear! Let's go! Move, lady, it's a fuckin' fire! I'm coming."
CARRIE	Samantha learned there's quite a difference between a rescue fantasy and a rescue reality.
BILL KELLY	It's getting late.
BILL KELLY	Are you sure I can't give you a ride?
CARRIE	"No, I'm good."
CARRIE	You go You go and do your thing.
BILL KELLY	"Do I get your vote? Too fast? My God, you're so sexy."

CARRIE	Kissing is enough.
CARRIE	"It's enough for tonight, really."
CARRIE	"oh, shit."
CARRIE	"It's almost 12:00, I'm gonna miss the last ferry."
CARRIE	Wait! Wait! I lost my Choo.
BILL KELLY	Need a ride?
CARRIE	"He didn't have a white horse, but he did have a BMW with a working heater."
CARRIE	"So I guess, sometimes a woman absolutely has to be rescued."
CARRIE	You're taking me home and that's it.
BILL KELLY	That's itfor tonight.
BILL KELLY	"Now, any idea howwe get the fuck off this island?"
CARRIE	"oK, make a right."
CARRIE	"And sometimes, a woman absolutely has to rescue a man."
CARRIE	"At least, that's how it ends in this Staten lsland fairytale."
CARRIE	I had been dating politician Bill Kelley for three weeks.
CARRIE	"Since most of our time was spent campaigning, I dressed the part."
CARRIE	I found some vintage Halston and did a spin on Jackie Kennedy.
CARRIE	The early years.
BILL KELLY	Who here knows what a city comptroller does? You do?
CARRIE	We made a good match.
CARRIE	"I was adept at fashion, he at politics."
BILL KELLY	"This city's populace's passion, Iove and devotion to their home"
CARRIE	"Really, they're both about recycling ideas and making them seem fresh and inspiring."
BILL KELLY	"It is this love affair, this symbiotic relationship between citizens and city, that I promise to cherish and protect."
BILL KELLY	Thank you.
CAMPAIGNER	Great guy!
CARRIE	"Yes, he is."

STEVE	"Thursday, then."
IRANDA	"oK, maybe Thursday."

IRANDA	I got it.
IRANDA	That's very sweet.
IRANDA	I just hadn't thought about things that way.
STEVE	"So, think about it."
IRANDA	oK.
STEVE	"Because I think if we really want to see if it can work between us, this time we got to make the commitment to be exclusive."
IRANDA	OK.
IRANDA	I hear you.
STEVE	OK.
CARRIE	"The truth was, there were no other candidates in sight."
CARRIE	But Miranda wasn't ready to let Steve win by default.
CHARLOTTE	You're dating a politician and you're not even registered to vote.

SAMANTHA	The country runs better with a good-looking man in charge Look at Nixon.
SAMANTHA	"No one wanted to fuck him, so he fucked everyone."
CHARLOTTE	I had a crush on Dan Quayle.
CARRIE	we need a president in a hat.
CARRE	"Really, they're both about recycling ideas and making them seem fresh and inspiring."
CARRIE	"FDR, good president, wore a hat."
IRANDA	"So busy picking a hat, he forgot to get in the war."
CHARLOTTE	I had a crush on Dan Quayle.
CARRIE	we tried to ignore That the first time.
CHARLOTTE	"It was his crisp, white shirts."
CHARLOTTE	Reminded me Of my father.
IRANDA	"So, You were voting for your father."
SAMANTHA	There was something homoerotic about Quayle and Bush.
SAMANTHA	very Batman and Robin.
CHARLOTTE	"Based strictly on looks, no one was cuter than JFK."
CARRIE	Or quicker to jump in the sack.
IRANDA	I'm glad you three weren't around during the original 13 colonies.
IRANDA	I don't think our founding fathers were very fuckable.
SAMANTHA	I heard that Thomas Jefferson was a real fox.
CARRIE	There we were.
CARRIE	Just four girls talking politics.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, Miranda was facing a day at the polls earlier than she expected."
IRANDA	"Last night as we were walking home, Steve asked me to go steady."
CARRIE	How sweet.
CARRIE	They still call it that?
IRANDA	I don't know if I can make that commitment.
CARRIE	How many other guys are you dating?
IRANDA	That's not the point.
IRANDA	I'm so ambivalent about Steve and moving forward.
CARRIE	You did let him back in your life.
CARRIE	There must be something there.
IRANDA	There's plenty there.
IRANDA	Flaws that make me not want to stick my neck out.
IRANDA	But there's great stuff too.
IRANDA	Maybe I should be honest and tell him what I really feel which is.
IRANDA	what if somebody better comes along?
CARRIE	You gotta put a better spin on it than that.
IRANDA	You seethat's my problem.
IRANDA	I don't know how to be political in relationships.
CARRIE	It's time for the list.
CARRIE	Things you like about him.
CARRIE	Things you don't like.
CARRIE	see Which is longer.
IRANDA	That's so judgmental.
CARRIE	You are judgmental.
CARRIE	Put it to good use.
IRANDA	"oK, fine."
IRANDA	I'll make a list.
CARRIE	Politics were always as relevant to me as a new Erica Jong novel.
CARRIE	But I did find it interesting that a discussion about politics ultimately became a discussion about sex.
CARRIE	And a discussion about sex became a question of politics.
CARRIE	"Which led me to wonder, if the two were inextricably linked, and if so can there be sex without politics? That night, Samantha discovered her own hot, new candidate."
JEFF FENTON	"Hey, Pink Lady."
JEFF FENTON	can I buy that for you?
SAMANTHA	"Maybe, if you promise never to use a lame line like that again."
JEFF FENTON	It worked didn't it? Jeff Fenton.
SAMANTHA	Samantha Jones.
JEFF FENTON	You are damn attractive.
JEFF FENTON	And that is not a line.
SAMANTHA	How long have you been sitting here?
JEFF FENTON	my first drink.
SAMANTHA	"So, you're just naturally forward?"
JEFF FENTON	I'm aggressive.
JEFF FENTON	I run a successful hedge fund.
JEFF FENTON	My life is about calculating risks.
JEFF FENTON	Telling a beautiful lady she's attractive is the safest bet I've made all day.
SAMANTHA	Thank you.
JEFF FENTON	You like to ski?
SAMANTHA	I love it.
JEFF FENTON	We have a house in Sun Valley.
JEFF FENTON	How long have you been skiing?
SAMANTHA	on and off for years.
JEFF FENTON	I can tell.
JEFF FENTON	You've got the legs for it.
SAMANTHA	Got to run back to the office.
JEFF FENTON	How about dinner this week? I told you all about me but I didn't hear about you.
CARRIE	Samantha never felt better.
JEFF FENTON	There were gorgeous women sitting on either side and Jeff had elected her.
SAMANTHA	Fenton Partners.
JEFF FENTON	That's right.
JEFF FENTON	We're up 320 % for the year.
JEFF FENTON	Samantha Jones.
JEFF FENTON	Public Relations.
JEFF FENTON	Very nice.
JEFF FENTON	You must do well.
JEFF FENTON	Who's gonna say no to you? What about dinner? Friday night?
SAMANTHA	I think That might work.
CARRIE	Just as her self-esteem was soaring right off the charts
JEFF FENTON	"Nice to meet you, Pink Lady."
JEFF FENTON	I'll give you a call.
SAMANTHA	Bye.
CARRIE	"Later that week, I brought ""the single ladies coalition to elect Bill Kelley"" to a fundraiser."
SAMANTHA	What is the height difference between a short person and a little person?
CARRIE	a little person?
SAMANTHA	a midget.
CHARLOTTE	a midget Or a dwarf?
CARRIE	What's the difference? Little person is the proper way to refer to an adult under 5 feet.
SAMANTHA	I agreed to go on a date with a very short person.
SAMANTHA	I didn't realize he was so short.
SAMANTHA	Sitting down he was proportional.
SAMANTHA	"Standing, he barely clears my nipples."
CARRIE	That may be the perfect height.
SAMANTHA	I can't cancel just because he's a munchkin.
CARRIE	This is a politically incorrect conversation for a political fundraiser.
CHARLOTTE	Less than five feet is unacceptable.
CHARLOTTE	I have to go mingle.
CHARLOTTE	There are a lot of cute guys here and these things never last beyond two martinis.
CARRIE	Charlotte was running her own campaign.
CARRIE	She wanted to be elected wife before the year was out.
CARRIE	There's Miranda.
SAMANTHA	Give me that.
CARRIE	"Hey, you made it."
IRANDA	"Tell me, Why are we voting for this guy? ."
CARRIE	"He wants an investigation into the Board of Education for waste, and he's against large corporations wasting your tax dollars"
CARRIE	I'm sleeping with him.
STEVE	good enough for me.
CARRIE	"come on, I'll introduce you."
BILL KELLY	"Jesus christ, he talks more than I do."
CARRIE	This is the lovely Miranda Hobbes.
CARRIE	And her friend Steve Brady.
STEVE	Hi.
IRANDA	I've heard great things about you.
BILL KELLY	You must be reading my clippings.
BILL KELLY	I pay people a lot to say nice things.
STEVE	"If you win, maybe you can fix a couple of parking tickets."
STEVE	I owe New York city $500.
STEVE	I figured I need the money more than they do.
STEVE	"It's a joke! come on, he knows I'm kidding."
STEVE	I'll get us a drink.
STEVE	Nice meeting you.
BILL KELLY	Nice meeting you.
BILL KELLY	Excuse me.
IRANDA	The dumb jokes.
IRANDA	con.
IRANDA	cute buttpro.
SAMANTHA	I don't believe in the Republican Party or Democratic Party.
SAMANTHA	I just believe in parties.
CARRIE	"Charlotte was stumping for her cause, and making newfriends."
BOB	I love Liechtenstein.
BOB	But I loved comic books as a kid.
CHARLOTTE	But that's great.
CHARLOTTE	His work is accessible on so many levels.
BOB	"Sweetheart, this is Charlotte."
BOB	She runs a gallery downtown.
BOB	"Charlotte, this is my fiancee catherine."
CATHERINE	Hi.
CHARLOTTE	Nice to meet you.
CARRIE	Stanford! Hi.
STANFORD	"I can only stay a few minutes, I have tickets to the ""Vagina Monologues""."

STANFORD	"I don't eat at the restaurant, but I can still hear the specials."
BILL KELLY	"Carrie, Give me a sip Of your drink."
CARRIE	"this is my friend, Stanford Blatch."
BILL KELLY	Bill Kelley.
STANFORD	I represent the queer vote.
STANFORD	"If you can carry chelsea, you've got the city locked up."
BILL KELLY	I'm not worried about chelsea.
BILL KELLY	Have you seen my ass?
STANFORD	Got my vote.
CAMPAIGN MANAGER	12 o'clock.
BILL KELLY	Excuse me.
STANFORD	Who's that guy?
CARRIE	That's his campaign manager.
STANFORD	fix me up.
CARRIE	How do you even know he's gay?
STANFORD	I've seen him rollerblading on 8th Avenue.
STANFORD	That's enough.
STANFORD	Please? .
CARRIE	"Great, now I'm a first lady and a pimp"
CARRIE	"Hey, excuse me."
CARRIE	"This is awkward, so feel free to stop me at any time, but there's a person here who would like to meet you."
CAMPAIGN MANAGER	oK.
CARRIE	a guy.
CAMPAIGN MANAGER	Keep going.
CARRIE	It's the guy right over there.
CAMPAIGN MANAGER	You mean the blonde guy with the great arms.
CARRIE	"Actually, no."
CARRIE	"It's the bald guy, with the great sense of humor."
CAMPAIGN MANAGER	do You knowthe blonde Guy?
CARRIE	no.
CAMPAIGN MANAGER	He's really much more my type.
CARRIE	oK.
CARRIE	Well Go Kelley.
CARRIE	I wondered howto handle this political hot potato.
CARRIE	He's not gay.
STANFORD	I Could have sworn he was.
CARRIE	I realized I was getting good at politics.
CHARLOTTE	I'm just so at the place where I'm ready to settle down.
CHARLOTTE	It seems like a miracle when two nice people like you can find each other.
BOB	We met in the most unusual way.
CATHERINE	one of my girlfriends threw a party Where all the women brought a man they weren't interested in.
CATHERINE	Somebody brought Bob.
BOB	the rest is history.
CHARLOTTE	I love that! one woman's trash is another woman's treasure.
CARRIE	"Bill raised $6,000 that night."
CARRIE	It really got him in the mood.
BILL KELLY	"You know, you're the first woman in ages I've felt this intimate with."
BILL KELLY	You're so beautiful.
BILL KELLY	So funnyyou're great.
CARRIE	Thank you.
BILL KELLY	I love making love to you.
CARRIE	The feeling is mutual.
BILL KELLY	Is there anything you want or need that I'm not doing?
CARRIE	"No, it's great."
BILL KELLY	'cause I want to know.
BILL KELLY	I want to make You happy.
CARRIE	I am happy.
CARRIE	What about you? Is there anything you want or need that I'm not doing?
BILL KELLY	No.
BILL KELLY	Wellmaybe one thing.
CARRIE	what?
BILL KELLY	"Well, I would love to get you in the shower."
BILL KELLY	Get each other all fresh and clean.
CARRIE	That sounds nice.
BILL KELLY	And then I'd like you to pee on me.
IRANDA	I Would be Worried.
IRANDA	The pee could be foreplay.
CARRIE	My God!
IRANDA	Where there's smoke.
SAMANTHA	It's typical of men in power.
SAMANTHA	They love to be dominated.
SAMANTHA	Humiliated.
CHARLOTTE	What did you say?
CARRIE	"I told him I'd just gone, maybe another time."
CARRIE	I can't keep saying that forever.
SAMANTHA	"I peed on a guy once during sex, but it was an accident."
IRANDA	What did he say?
SAMANTHA	I don't think he noticed.
CHARLOTTE	I once had to stop eating meat for six months.
CARRIE	"So this is what it's come down to ready, set, pee?"
SAMANTHA	Sometimes with the right guy you have to make concessions.
SAMANTHA	There's always gonna be something.
CARRIE	are You advocating That I do this?
SAMANTHA	Why not? He's a great-looking political prince.
CARRIE	"Sure, it's practically a fairytale."
	.
CARRIE	"""The Princess And The Pee""."
CHARLOTTE	"If you can't work it out with Bill, bring him to my party on Friday."
CHARLOTTE	Everyone is bringing a guy they're no longer interested in.
SAMANTHA	"That's a great idea, I can bring my short guy."
CARRIE	You're dating a munchkin and I'm following the yellow brick road.
CARRIE	"A couple of nights later, and no closer to a solution, I had a date with Bill."
CARRIE	"We went to his favorite lndian restaurant, that boasted the hottest curry in the city."
BILL KELLY	So I just got some new polls.
BILL KELLY	I'm ahead in Manhattan and Brooklyn but I'm lagging in the Bronx.
BILL KELLY	"I may have to spend another $15,000 to buy myself some voter turnout."
BILL KELLY	"Pretty hot, isn't it? Have some water."
CARRIE	"No, I'm fine."
BILL KELLY	"Excuse me, can I get another one? You want a beer? So, I read your column yesterday."
CARRIE	You did?
BILL KELLY	It's great.
BILL KELLY	Very funny.
BILL KELLY	Just one question.
BILL KELLY	Who's the handsome politico you refer to?
CARRIE	He's just some other fellow I'm seeing in washington
CARRIE	"You don't mind, do you?"
BILL KELLY	my life is an open book.
BILL KELLY	It has to be.
BILL KELLY	What I love about the column is the way you feel about it.
BILL KELLY	It's mutual.
BILL KELLY	Even if I can't put it in print like you.
BILL KELLY	I am so crazy about you.
CARRIE	Me too.
BILL KELLY	I was hoping we could spend the night together but I have an early meeting with the Brooklyn That's no problem.
BILL KELLY	Rain check?
CARRIE	"That Friday night, Charlotte threw her ""used date party""."
CHARLOTTE	"Hi, you made it! There are so many eligible men here."
STANFORD	"Hi Charlotte, nice apartment."
CARRIE	"can I get you something to drink? Yes, immediately, if not sooner."
CHARLOTTE	You brought Stanford?
CARRIE	You said to bring a man you're not interested in.
CHARLOTTE	You're making a mockery of this party.
SAMANTHA	"Carrie, Charlotte!"
CARRIE & CHARLOTTE	Hi! -.
SAMANTHA	This is Jeff Fenton
JEFF FENTON	ladies.
CARRIE	how do You do?
JEFF FENTON	It's a pleasure.
JEFF FENTON	I'll take your coat.
SAMANTHA	take your time.
SAMANTHA	Mingle.
SAMANTHA	Is he the smallest man you've ever seen?
CHARLOTTE	If you'll excuse me I have to meet my eligible guests
SAMANTHA	I've got to get busy too.
IRANDA	Carrie!
CARRIE	"Hey, What are You doing here?"
IRANDA	"I figured, before I finalize the list, I should see what's out there"
CARRIE	How's that list going?
IRANDA	"Great, Fine."
IRANDA	I'm guessing that's Samantha's little friend.
GREG MILLER	You gotta go to cuba now.
GREG MILLER	Another year will be too late.
CHARLOTTE	can't you get arrested for going?
GREG MILLER	Fly through canada.
GREG MILLER	They love Americans.
GREG MILLER	I'll e-mail you some of my pictures.

GREG MILLER	"Charlotte, right?"
CHARLOTTE	"Right, and"
GREG MILLER	Greg Miller.

WOMAN AT PARTY	having Any luck?
JEFF FENTON	Excuse me?
WOMAN AT PARTY	meeting someone.
JEFF FENTON	I'm already here with somebody.
WOMAN AT PARTY	"Yeah, an ex girlfriend, right?"
JEFF FENTON	What are you talking about?
WOMAN AT PARTY	Get a clue.
JEFF FENTON	You brought me here to dump me?
SAMANTHA	not Exactly.
SAMANTHA	"I thought, maybe you could meet someone your own size."
JEFF FENTON	"Sweetheart, give me an hour in bed, you'll swear I'm the Jolly Green Giant."
SAMANTHA	Really?
JEFF FENTON	I'm the best you've ever had.
CARRIE	She felt so politically incorrect about dumping a man for his height.
CARRIE	She felt she had to sleep with him.
SAMANTHA	Fine.
SAMANTHA	Let's go.
CARRIE	"oK, I'm ready to go."
CARRIE	There's nobody here for us.
STANFORD	Speak for yourself.
STANFORD	"If these guys are in their thirties and these women don't want them, there might just be a little something for me."
CARRIE	Talk to you tomorrow.
STANFORD	Hi.
GREG MILLER	I'm an adventure travel junkie.
GREG MILLER	I took the year off after business school.
GREG MILLER	Trekked the old spice trail in Asia.
CARRIE	"Talking to Greg, Charlotte felt like she had unearthed a rare coin that some other woman had discarded."
GREG MILLER	"This is my ex, Belinda Peters, she hooked me up on this thing."
CHARLOTTE	You must be a friend of Karen's.
CHARLOTTE	Thanks for bringing this great man.
BELINDA PETERS	You're welcome.
BELINDA PETERS	can I talk to you for a minute?
GREG MILLER	Sure.
GREG MILLER	Excuse me.
CHARLOTTE	Bye.
CHARLOTTE	Thanks for coming.
CARRIE	"once Melinda saw Greg talking to another woman, he suddenly looked all shiny and new again."
CARRIE	"That night, Jeff proved to Samantha that he more than made up for his shortcomings."
CARRIE	Samantha told us later it was like having sex with a horny smurf.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, across town, Steve was busy stuffing Miranda's ballot box."
STEVE	"You know, I'm not looking for a quick answer in the monogamy thing."
STEVE	It's probably something that's got to happen on its own.
STEVE	It's just that I wanted you to know how I feel.
STEVE	You're the best woman I've ever met.
STEVE	I want you to knowto know that.
STEVE	"I love you, Miranda."
STEVE	I really do.
CARRIE	Steve had just said the one big pro that outweighed all the cons.
CARRIE	"Later that week, Samantha put her heels away and gave Jeff a chance."
JEFF FENTON	Little boy's room.
JEFF FENTON	I'll be right back.
CARRIE	Samantha was stunned.
CARRIE	It was one thing to date a man who went to the little boy's room.
CARRIE	Another to date one who still shopped at the little boy's department.
JEFF FENTON	Samantha!
SAMANTHA	I'm not feeling very well.
SAMANTHA	I've got to go.
SAMANTHA	Goodnight.
JEFF FENTON	"Wait, I'll take you."
SAMANTHA	I'm not really sick.
SAMANTHA	"Look, Jeff I can't do this."
SAMANTHA	It's not a good idea.
SAMANTHA	I don't want to lead you on.
JEFF FENTON	Lead me on? You came five times the other night.
SAMANTHA	It's not really that -
JEFF FENTON	"Then, what? What happened in the past five minutes?"
SAMANTHA	You shop at the boy's department.
JEFF FENTON	"So, what? The clothes fit me better, plus they're cheaper."
JEFF FENTON	"Where do you shop, the big and tall whore store? You're nothing but a big dick with a little man attached."
SAMANTHA	You're nothing but a big dick with a little man attached.
JEFF FENTON	"You're nothing but a big pair of tits, with too much extra leg room."
CARRIE	"Surprisingly, Samantha had found what she was really looking for."
CARRIE	And it had nothing to do with size.
JEFF FENTON	Somebody get me a booster chair.
CARRIE	She'd found a man who made her laugh.
CARRIE	They dated for two weeks.
CARRIE	"Though he was short, it was a long relationship for Samantha."
CARRIE	"That night, parched and nervous, I spent another night with Bill."
BILL KELLY	"man, That was great."
CARRIE	"Yes, It was."
BILL KELLY	"come on, let's take a shower."
BILL KELLY	"come on, get in while it's hot."
CARRIE	can I talk to You about something?
BILL KELLY	oK.
CARRIE	"I've been giving this peeing thing a lot of thought, and while I think it's totally fine that that's what you're into, I just It's just never really been my thing."
BILL KELLY	"oh, yeah?"
CARRIE	"Yeah, so I thought instead, maybe you could close your eyes and I could dribble warm tea on you."
CARRIE	That might feel good.
CARRIE	ormaybe you might think it's fun to hear the sound of running water when we have sex.
CARRIE	"And, if things got really serious between us, I could maybe, even, leave the bathroom door open sometime."
CARRIE	"Although, I'm really not sure how comfortable I'd be with that either."
BILL KELLY	"You know, there's something I want to tell you too."
CARRIE	Some people connected with the campaign read your column and they had a different take on it.
BILL KELLY	What Does That mean?
BILL KELLY	"They said it was funny and clever, but that it was a lot about sex."
BILL KELLY	They don't think I should date a sex columnist before the election.
BILL KELLY	They thought it was kind of seamy.
CARRIE	"Wait a second, I may write about sex, but you like people to pee on you."
BILL KELLY	"Yeah, but nobody knows about that."
CARRIE	I realized that politics had entered my bedroom as well as my bathroom.
CARRIE	I decided that my bravest political act would be to tell the truth.
CARRIE	I didn't use his real name.
CARRIE	It was much more political not to
CARRIE	There are fewthings I love as much as Sunday brunch.
CARRIE	You can sleep till noon and still get eggs anywhere in the city.
CARRIE	Alcohol is often included.
CARRIE	"And it's the one day you get the single woman's sports' pages ""The New York Times"" wedding section."
CHARLOTTE	This is so depressing.
IRANDA	The oldest woman on this page is 27.
IRANDA	Now I'm depressed and I haven't had coffee yet.
CHARLOTTE	At least you have a boyfriend.
IRANDA	That only means I'm getting laid.
CARRIE	On a regular basis.
SAMANTHA	I'll drink to that.
CHARLOTTE	"Until recently, the bride, 24, worked as a supervisor at Ogilvy & Mather."
CHARLOTTE	24!
CARRIE	No more reading aloud.
IRANDA	"I love how they say ""until recently""."
CARRIE	Meaning she quit her job once she found her soul mate /investment banker.
IRANDA	It's so retro.
IRANDA	I've got a rock on my finger.
IRANDA	Now I can stop pretending to care about my career.
SAMANTHA	"Until recently, the bride had a life of her own."
CARRIE	You know who they marry? The roman numeral guys.
CHARLOTTE	Charles Duffy Anderson lV.
CARRIE	"Ding, Ding, ding."
SAMANTHA	"The higher the number, the worse the sex."
SAMANTHA	I dated a lll.
SAMANTHA	He couldn't get it up.
IRANDA	How bad must Henry Vlll have been!
CARRIE	"You give him head, he cuts yours off!"
CHARLOTTE	This couple met on a bike tour.
CHARLOTTE	I just make it through spinning.
CHARLOTTE	All the men are gay.
CARRIE	It's amazing how upset women get over the marital status of strangers.
IRANDA	What was that?
CHARLOTTE	Nothing.
CARRIE	let me see.
CHARLOTTE	Nothing to see.
SAMANTHA	You're such a bad liar.
CARRIE	Then there's the occasional familiar face.
CARRIE	"Well, it's official."
CARRIE	He's married.
CARRIE	"Where are my fries? It's fine, all right? I was prepared for this."
CARRIE	They had an engagement party at the Plaza.
CHARLOTTE	Sometimes they break off.
IRANDA	This one didn't.
IRANDA	Let's move on.
CARRIE	"Why is their wedding like a short story? What's next, a movie?"
SAMANTHA	"It's fluff, it's PR."
SAMANTHA	Anybody could be this story.
CHARLOTTE	Anybody who's getting married.
IRANDA	"This is what I hate about ""The Sunday Times""."
IRANDA	This and the country houses I can't afford.
CHARLOTTE	You want to rent a movie?
CARRIE	It's OK.
CARRIE	I'm not gonna slit my wrists.
CHARLOTTE	I just thought you might want some company.
CARRIE	You know what? I think I want to be alone.
CHARLOTTE	"OK, I'm just gonna take the paper."
CARRIE	Would You stop?
CHARLOTTE	I know what you're gonna do.
CHARLOTTE	You can't not read it.
CHARLOTTE	You'll cry and it'll be awful.
CHARLOTTE	Let's read it now and get it over with.
CHARLOTTE	"The couple met in Paris, on the lle St-Louis."
CARRIE	"How original, they fell in love in Paris."
CHARLOTTE	"""l was alone at a cafe when the waiter brought over a bottle of Pinot Noir ""from a handsome man at the bar"", the bride said, her eyes sparkling."
CHARLOTTE	"""When we'd finished the wine, I knew I wanted to marry him."
CHARLOTTE	You were drunk and he was rich.
CHARLOTTE	This is just bad journalism.
CHARLOTTE	"Marry they did, in Southampton at the bride's parents' estate."
CHARLOTTE	There were only 50 guests.
CHARLOTTE	"""We wanted it intimate."
CHARLOTTE	Just family and close friends.
CARRIE	"And ""The New York Times""."
CHARLOTTE	how intimate is that?
CARRIE	I don't hear Big anywhere in this article.
CARRIE	She's calling the shots and he's just along for the ride.
CHARLOTTE	"The bride Carried calla lilies, tied with a red ribbon."
CARRIE	That's nice.
CHARLOTTE	"As she walked down the aisle a saxophone played ""When A Man Loves A Woman""."
CHARLOTTE	"Well, that's tacky."
CARRIE	"No, that's Big."
CARRIE	What I wouldn't give for a working fireplace.
CHARLOTTE	He wasn't the right man for you.
CARRIE	I know that.
CARRIE	"I know, it's not him."
CARRIE	It's the whole wedding.
CARRIE	"And it's herher! You know, she's just you know, shiny hair, style section Vera Wang."
CARRIE	And I'm the sex column they run next to ads for penile implants.
CARRIE	Big wasn't the only one taking the plunge.
CARRIE	"After more than a decade of domestic independence, Miranda had opened up to a relationship Good morning."
CARRIE	with a cleaning lady.
CARRIE	"Good morning, Magda."
IRANDA	Do you know where the coffee mugs are?
AGDA	I moved them here.
AGDA	now All glasses are together.
IRANDA	I Guess That makes more sense.
IRANDA	"You know what? I always drink coffee out of my law school class of '90 mug, because it's bigger, and It's just what I always use."
AGDA	I bring you nice herbal teas.
AGDA	Tea is better for you.
IRANDA	"Oh, thank you very much, but I prefer coffee."
IRANDA	Thank you.
IRANDA	Why do I have a rolling pin?
AGDA	It's for you to make pies.
AGDA	It's good for women to make pies.
IRANDA	do You have a rolling pin?
CARRIE	on me?
IRANDA	in your kitchen?
CARRIE	I use my oven for storage.
IRANDA	My cleaning lady brought me one.
IRANDA	She couldn't believe I didn't have one.
CARRIE	I can't believe you have a cleaning lady.
IRANDA	Don't even start.
IRANDA	I feel guilty enough.
IRANDA	I hate being home when she is.
IRANDA	"I feel like if I'm home, I should be cleaning or making pies."
IRANDA	She says that's what women do.
CARRIE	"Where did you find her, in a time capsule?"
IRANDA	I know.
IRANDA	I don't need to make pies.
IRANDA	I'm practically a partner in a major lawfirm.
IRANDA	"If I want pie, I can buy it."
CARRIE	I think I need this in a smaller size.
IRANDA	"I'll get it for you, just hand it out, there's no need Carrie?"
CARRIE	"And there she was, Mrs."
CARRIE	"Big, all five foot ten of her."
CARRIE	"Hey Hi, Natasha."
CARRIE	"I heardI read Congratulations on the thing, on the wedding."
CARRIE	"This is Miranda, we're shopping."
NATASHA	Hi.
IRANDA	Nice to meet you.
CARRIE	"That looks nice, what you have on there."
NATASHA	"You think? I need something for this ""Women ln The Arts"" luncheon I helped organize."
NATASHA	I'm on the steering committee.
CARRIE	Really? I'm a member.
CARRIE	"You know, I write, so I am a woman in the arts."
CARRIE	I go to that lunch every year in clothes.
NATASHA	"So, you're going then?"
CARRIE	"Yeah, I'm going."
NATASHA	"Great, I'll see you there."
CARRIE	All Right.
CARRIE	"Oh, my God."
CARRIE	"Now, I can't find the invitation."
SAMANTHA	Why did you say you'd go?
CARRIE	"I've talked to her twice, once in a cowboy hat, and once in my bra."
CARRIE	Like freakin' Annie-get-your-clothes-on.
CARRIE	I would just like her to see me looking normal.
SAMANTHA	Just normal?
CARRIE	I Would prefer to look amazing.
CARRIE	"Not like I'm trying, just effortlessly striking."
SAMANTHA	I see.
SAMANTHA	"And will Big be at this event? It's a ""Women In The Arts"" luncheon."
CARRIE	"It's not about Big, it's about Natasha."
SAMANTHA	It seems to be a lot of trouble for a woman.
CARRIE	Can you help me find out when and where it is?.
SAMANTHA	"I can do better than that, I'm coming too"
CARRIE	"So, you support women in the arts?"
SAMANTHA	"I support you, and these bitches need to be put in their places."
CARRIE	That night I modeled my wardrobe in my head and vetoed everything.
CARRIE	"Why did I care so much? What was it about Natasha that made me feel like the charity case? Was it just that she had Big, or was this bigger than Big? I started to wonder."
CARRIE	"Are there women in New York just there to make us feel bad about ourselves? For Miranda, that woman was a certain Ukrainian housekeeper."
IRANDA	You're early.
AGDA	"Yes, good morning."
IRANDA	Did you bring me this?
AGDA	"It's gift, to make your bathroom nicer."
IRANDA	Thanks.
IRANDA	Did you move my hairdryer? It used to be under the sink.
AGDA	In the middle drawer.
AGDA	Last week I organize for you.
IRANDA	"No, that drawer doesn't need organizing."
CARRIE	"Magda had discovered Miranda's ""goodie-drawer""."
IRANDA	"I have a boyfriend, so it's not like I'm sleeping with lots of different men."
IRANDA	For a long time there was no guy and that's why I have the other thing.
AGDA	oK.
AGDA	You like this boyfriend?
IRANDA	Yes.
AGDA	You want to marry this man?
IRANDA	I don't know.
AGDA	Everybody wants to get married.
AGDA	I am married 28 years.
IRANDA	"Well, we'll see."
AGDA	I don't know if I want to get married.
AGDA	God bless you.
IRANDA	I don't need you to bless me.
IRANDA	I don't need God to bless me.
IRANDA	I'm fine with my life as it is.
IRANDA	It's like I hired my mother.
CARRIE	"Manhattan has spas, where a woman can pay to feel good about herself."
CARRIE	I can't believe she opened your goodie-drawer.
CARRIE	Everybody knows the night-stand is private.
CARRIE	What do you have in there?
IRANDA	"The usual, condoms, vibrator -"
CARRIE	"Massage oil, cigarettes."
SAMANTHA	Nipple clamps.
CHARLOTTE	Really?
SAMANTHA	"Not for me, for them."
CHARLOTTE	That's freakish.
IRANDA	"What's in your goodie-drawer, Robert's ""Rules Of Order""?"
CHARLOTTE	I don't have a goodie-drawer.
CARRIE	Everybody has one.
SAMANTHA	I've got a goodie-closet.
CARRIE	I don't need to know what's in it.
IRANDA	Ditto.
IRANDA	Nipple clamps will suffice for today.
CHARLOTTE	"I'm not in the mood for steam, it's too hot."
SAMANTHA	"Then take off your towel, relax."
CHARLOTTE	I don't feel like being relaxed in here.
SAMANTHA	There goes a woman who desperately needs a goodie-drawer.
CARRIE	Charlotte? What's wrong?
CHARLOTTE	I was Just hot.
CARRIE	"OK, and"
CHARLOTTE	AndI'm just not comfortable being naked in public.
CARRIE	"This isn't really public, it's a ladies' locker-room."
CHARLOTTE	I didn't grow up in a naked house.
CARRIE	I didn't either.
CHARLOTTE	I bet she grew up in a naked house.
CARRIE	She might still live in a naked house.
CARRIE	"Sweetie, who cares how you look to other women."
CHARLOTTE	You have a perfect body.
CARRIE	You're deluded.
CARRIE	"Charlotte, you have a beautiful figure."
CHARLOTTE	Really?
CARRIE	Yes!
CHARLOTTE	Why was that women looking at me like my thighs were too big?
CARRIE	Samantha always felt good about herself.
CARRIE	"But after her 80-minute massage, she felt even better."
CELIA	I just had the most intense massage.
CELIA	Kevin goes down on you.
CARRIE	"Samantha's was good, but not that good."
SAMANTHA	are You serious?
CELIA	He's incredible.
CELIA	You should try him.
CARRIE	"Samantha smiled, but a woman with a goodie-closet doesn't need to pay for head."
KEVIN	Celia! Forgot your key.
CELIA	"Thanks, Kevin."
CARRIE	"Then again, you can never have too many massages."
CARRIE	Samantha immediately got on the wait list for Kevin's next available appointment.
CARRIE	"That night, Steve wasn't available."
CARRIE	Miranda chose the next best thing.
CARRIE	"Magda was not only cleaning, she was performing an exorcism."
CARRIE	"Later that week, I had a religious experience at Manolo Blahnik."
CARRIE	I need your opinion.
CHARLOTTE	You can't afford them?
WAIT STAFF	Can I get you something? .
CARRIE	"I'll have that incredibly rich-looking, flourless chocolate thing"
CARRIE	and a cafe au lait.
CHARLOTTE	I'll have a fruit cup.
CARRIE	Now you're making me feel bad.
CHARLOTTE	"No, get What You want."
CARRIE	This place has the best desserts.
CARRIE	The point of coming is to splurge.
CHARLOTTE	That was a splurge.
CHARLOTTE	Fruit has a lot of carbs.
CARRIE	"Is there a new ""Zone"" book out?"
CHARLOTTE	I hate my thighs.
CARRIE	The problem is not your thighs.
CARRIE	The problem is your head.
CARRIE	Now About the shoes.
CARRIE	Hold on I need these for the WlTA luncheon.
CARRIE	"The heels are almost high enough to put me face to face with Natasha, if Natasha wears flats."
CARRIE	But why would she wear flats? Do they make the right statement?
CHARLOTTE	What statement do you want to make?
CARRIE	"I am beautiful, powerful and don't care you're only 25, and married my ex."
CHARLOTTE	I thought you didn't have a complex about your looks.
CARRIE	It's not a complex.
CARRIE	"It's a Natasha specific obsession, which will be over when she sees me, at the benefit, looking fabulous, in these shoes and a dress from Bergdorf's that'll cost a month's rent."
CHARLOTTE	Listen to you.
CHARLOTTE	You don't have to prove anything.
CHARLOTTE	"You are stunning, intelligent and funny."
CHARLOTTE	"And what is she? Married, that's all."
CHARLOTTE	"You could go to that luncheon, wearing that, and still be the most incredible woman in the room."
CARRIE	"Wow! Why can't you do that for yourself? That afternoon, Charlotte faced her fear."
WOMAN AT SPA	I'd kill for your breasts.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, Samantha had spent the last half hour face-down, picturing Kevin's face down on her."
KEVIN	is this pressure OK?
SAMANTHA	"Oh, Yes."
SAMANTHA	That is just fine.
KEVIN	Ready to turn over now?
SAMANTHA	I most certainly am.
KEVIN	is this OK?
SAMANTHA	Yes.
KEVIN	is this OK?
SAMANTHA	Yes.
KEVIN	Is this OK?
SAMANTHA	Yes.
CARRIE	"Since they were running out of time, she took the matter in her own hands."
SAMANTHA	Is this OK?
CARRIE	"Apparently, it wasn't."
SPA MANAGER	What kind of person does such a thing? To molest a trained professional while he is trying to do his job.
SPA MANAGER	"Helena Rubinstein is a civilized place, for civilized people."
SPA MANAGER	"I'm sorry, I can't allow you to come back here."
SPA MANAGER	I have to protect my staff.
CARRIE	"Clearly, she meant Kevin's staff."
SAMANTHA	This isn't my fault.
SAMANTHA	"I know that Kevin went down on another customer, and that's why I booked the appointment."
CARRIE	"The following Monday, Samantha and I were the definition of civilized."
CARRIE	We officially became ladies who luncheon.
SAMANTHA	"It was entrapment, false advertising and blatant discrimination."
SAMANTHA	You can't go down on one and not the other.
SAMANTHA	"I paid good money, expecting to be eaten out."
CARRIE	This is not the conversation I wish to have as my most amazing self.
SAMANTHA	do You see her?
CARRIE	No But I do see Wendy Wasserstein and Gloria Steinem.
SAMANTHA	"believe me, You look stunning."
CARRIE	You know what? I believe you.
CARRIE	"Hello Mimi, Ms Carrie Bradshaw, and Ms Samantha Jones."
CARRIE	"I'm a member, I just haven't been to an event, ever."
CARRIE	It's Bradshaw.
IMI	Here you are.
IMI	Wear your name tags.
IMI	Last year we had an incident with Joyce Carol Oates.
CARRIE	"I'm not sure the ""Hello, my name is"" goes with the ensemble."
SAMANTHA	"Hello, my name is Fabulous."
CARRIE	"Oh, Natasha's not here yet."
IMI	Natasha's not coming.
IMI	"What? She's got a cold, and didn't want to get everybody sick."
IMI	Here are your drink tickets.
SAMANTHA	I can't believe that bitch is a no-show.
CARRIE	I'm the one who's sick.
CARRIE	Charged another outfit I can't afford.
CARRIE	"Maybe bounced a cheque to charity, just to prove I'm amazing."
CARRIE	I've never felt less so.
CARRIE	Let's just go.
SAMANTHA	"I've paid $85, we're having our drinks."
SAMANTHA	What do you feel like?
CARRIE	Loser on the rocks?
SAMANTHA	Give me those tickets.
IRANDA	Who is this and what's she doing in my bedroom?
AGDA	Virgin Mary.
IRANDA	And where's my other thing?
AGDA	What thing?
IRANDA	"You know, the thing."
IRANDA	Don't make me say it.
IRANDA	The thing you replaced with this lady.
AGDA	"Bathroom, middle drawer."
AGDA	Next to hairdryer.
AGDA	No man will marry you if that is by your bed.
AGDA	It says you don't need him.
IRANDA	What I don't need is another mother.
IRANDA	"I have one in Philadelphia, and that's close enough."
IRANDA	"I need a housekeeper, who will clean my apartment and stop judging because I'm a 34 year old, single woman in New York."
IRANDA	"I drink coffee, have sex, buy pies and enjoy battery-operated devices."
IRANDA	"If you can't deal with that, I will find a housekeeper who can."
WIA WOMAN	I also head the committee to match mentors with underprivileged children.
WIA WOMAN	It'd be wonderful if you'd be willing to work with kids who want to write.
CARRIE	I write about sex.
CARRIE	Is that something they'd like to learn? Writing about blow jobs?
WIA WOMAN	We can always use help in fundraising.
SAMANTHA	"Carrie, this is Jenna."
CARRIE	"Hi, Jenna."
JENNA	Nice to meet you.
SAMANTHA	Jenna went to college with Natasha.
SAMANTHA	"Go ahead, tell her what you told me."
JENNA	"OK, well, Natasha lived in my dorm, freshmen year at Tulane."
JENNA	"Once, she showered with a guy in the community bathroom."
JENNA	"And And she gained like ten pounds, sophomore year."
CARRIE	Wow.
SAMANTHA	Ten pounds.
SAMANTHA	"Thanks, Jenna."
SAMANTHA	Merry Christmas.
CARRIE	That's supposed to make me feel better? Six years ago she had a weight problem?
SAMANTHA	It's something.
CARRIE	You had to love her for trying.
CARRIE	"Samantha tried to make me feel good by making Natasha sound bad, but it only made me feel worse."
SAMANTHA	another drink?
CARRIE	Another one and I'll lose my lunch.
SAMANTHA	When you get home you'll smile because she was a porker in college.
CARRIE	Ten pounds does not a porker make.
CELIA	You're Samantha Jones.
SAMANTHA	Yes.
CELIA	We met at Helena Rubinstein.
CELIA	"Katy, Leisle, look who's here."
CELIA	The woman who got Kevin fired.
KATY	Thanks a lot!
CELIA	"Yeah, Thanks."
LEISEL	Who's gonna fuck me now?
CELIA	Kevin fucked you?
CARRIE	Turns out I wasn't the kind of member those women in the arts needed.
CARRIE	"That night, in her spotless apartment, Miranda knew she'd been right to take a stand because of her night-stand."
CARRIE	"Magda realized that single women in New York never make pies, but they sometimes make guys."
CARRIE	"A few weeks later, I got something in the mail from Women In The Arts."
CARRIE	"It was a ""Thank you for attending"", signed by Natasha."
CARRIE	Game over.
CARRIE	"I had to accept that in life, some women are simply better."
CARRIE	"No amount of shoes, or lack of pastry or making of pies will change that."
CARRIE	"I will never be the woman with the perfect hair, who can wear white and not spill on it."
CARRIE	"And chair committees, and write thank you notes."
CARRIE	And I can't feel bad about that.
CARRIE	"""Sorry I couldn't be their."
CARRIE	""" T-H-E-l-R."
CARRIE	But I could feel good about this.
CARRIE	"Miranda, it's good she got married."
CARRIE	The woman's an idiot.
CARRIE	It's been said that New Yorkers are the most jaded people in the world.
CARRIE	The fact is we've done and seen it all.
CARRIE	"So when Charlotte said that her new show at the gallery would blow us away, we took it with the proverbial grain of salt."
IRANDA	"Seriously, that's a woman?"
CARRIE	"It was the latest installation from photographer Baird Johnson, entitled ""Drag Kings ""The collision of illusion and reality""."
CARRIE	"Yep, that's a woman."
STANTON	"Look at that bulge, it's shocking."
CARRIE	Hurry up and look before Giuliani shuts it down.
CHARLOTTE	What do You think?
CARRIE	It's amazing.
CARRIE	Congratulations.
SAMANTHA	Women dressed as men are popular.
CARRIE	"I thought it was ""Pokemon""."
IRANDA	All it takes is stick-on sideburns and a sock in your pants.
SAMANTHA	That's some sock.
STANFORD	I've always had a thing for cowboys.
CARRIE	"Reminder, John Wayne is a Jane."
STANFORD	I'm attracted to her.
STANFORD	Maybe I'm a lesbian.
SAMANTHA	I dated a guy who liked to wear my underwear.
SAMANTHA	But I've never gone the other way.
STANFORD	If you're gay you can wear everyone's underwear.
CHARLOTTE	That's hygienic?
SAMANTHA	Being a drag king would be fun.
IRANDA	"I have enough trouble trying to be a woman in a man's world, without being a woman pretending to be a man."
CARRIE	You wouldn't have to wax.
CARRIE	"If you change your mind, you've got cop written all over you."
BAIRD JOHNSON	am I rich yet?
BARID JOHNSON	Getting there.
CHARLOTTE	Everyone.
CHARLOTTE	"This is Baird, the artist."
CHARLOTTE	These are my friends.
IRANDA	What inspired you to do this?
BAIRD JOHNSON	I feel we have dual powers within each of us.
BAIRD JOHNSON	"Men can be very female, and women can be very male."
BAIRD JOHNSON	Gender's an illusion.
BAIRD JOHNSON	Sometimes a very beautiful illusion.
CHARLOTTE	"You know, I'm gonna go and get a canape."
CHARLOTTE	"Because, I'm starved, so Not that a canape is a meal."
CHARLOTTE	"But, you knowin a pinch."
CARRIE	Excuse us.
CARRIE	What was that about? Nobody loves canapes that much.
CHARLOTTE	He makes me nervous.
CHARLOTTE	I think he is
SAMANTHA	Ask Him out.
CHARLOTTE	I can never make the first move.
CARRIE	Sounds like someone needs a sock in the pants.
IRANDA	I'll drag myself home.
IRANDA	You wanna share a cab?
CARRIE	"No, I'm meeting Sean."
CHARLOTTE	the young Guy?
CARRIE	He's not that young.
IRANDA	He's 26.
IRANDA	His generation has a different letter than ours.
CARRIE	Who cares? Age is an illusion.
CARRIE AND MIRANDA	good night.
SAMANTH AND CHARLOTTE	good night.
CARRIE	"Later, Miranda found her apartment had undergone its own gender transformation."
IRANDA	What are you doing here?
STEVE	I got a key from when I fed your cat.
STEVE	I ordered us Chinese.
IRANDA	I didn't think we were seeing each other tonight.
STEVE	Planning on seeing the other boy?
IRANDA	Now you've ruined that This is what we're watching? Give me that.
STEVE	"Easy, you're making my brain hurt."
IRANDA	Don't you have to work tonight? Not until 10:00.
STEVE	I've got stuff here I can change into.
IRANDA	Right.
STEVE	But I got till 10:00.
CARRIE	Miranda loved the man inside of her.
CARRIE	She just didn't love him inside her apartment all the time.
SEAN	"Come on, the ice waits for no woman."
CARRIE	I'm practicing my triple salchow in my head.
CARRIE	"I was dragged around by Sean, my ""generation-something-else"" date."
CARRIE	"We met at a party, celebrating a new lnternet magazine Sean was running that I still couldn't find on my computer."
CARRIE	"Seriously, stop!"
SEAN	It's easier to balance when you're not smoking.
CARRIE	Smoking is the only thing that keeps me balanced.
SEAN	Doesn't this place rock? You have to give me credit for an original date.
CARRIE	It's not officially a date without cocktails.
CARRIE	My coach is gonna kill me.
CARRIE	"Half a flask later, Sean and I had broken the iceat least my ass had."
SEAN	That last fall was at least a 9.
	2
CARRIE	You and the Russian judgetough.
CARRIE	There was something about him.
CARRIE	"He was sexy, charmingcoordinated."
CARRIE	Nothing about him or our third date felt typical.
SEAN	When was your last serious relationship?
CARRIE	Until thenthere it was.
CARRIE	The inevitable third-date question.
SEAN	Bad question? You wanna take another spin around the death rink?
CARRIE	"No, it's fine."
CARRIE	It's fine.
CARRIE	I ended something a while ago.
CARRIE	Two years of a lot of back and forths.
CARRIE	We weren't Y2K compatible.
CARRIE	What about you?
SEAN	Before you there was Kayla.
SEAN	Neurotic.
SEAN	Lasted a year.
SEAN	"Before her, Lesley, couldn't commit."
SEAN	Before Lesley there was Mark.
SEAN	Is that a problem?
CARRIE	He's a bisexual.
SAMANTHA	I could have told you that.
SAMANTHA	He took you ice-skating.
CARRIE	The weird thing is he was so open.
CARRIE	"""Hi."
CARRIE	I'm a bisexual.
CARRIE	""" Like, ""Hi, I'm from Colorado""."
IRANDA	You're not allowed to be bisexual in Colorado.
CARRIE	"""ls that a problem?"" What kind of question is that?"
IRANDA	Of course!
CHARLOTTE	What did You say?
CARRIE	That it wasn't a problem.
CARRIE	He's such a good kisser.
SAMANTHA	That generation is all about sexual experimentation.
SAMANTHA	All the kids are going bi.
CARRIE	"If they all jump off a bridge, you will too?"
SAMANTHA	"I'm a ""try-sexual""."
SAMANTHA	I'll try anything once.
CARRIE	When did this happen? When did the sexes get all confused?
IRANDA	"Somewhere between Gen X and Y, they blended and made XY."
CARRIE	"I did the ""date the bisexual guy"" thing in college."
CARRIE	they All ended up with men.
SAMANTHA	So did the bisexual women.
CHARLOTTE	Which is why there are no men left for us.
CARRIE	Maybe I do have a problem with this.
CARRIE	I'm an old fart.
SAMANTHA	Correction: A hot old fart.
CARRIE	I'm not even sure bisexuality exists.
CARRIE	It's just a layover on the way to Gaytown.
IRANDA	Isn't that next to Ricky Martinville?
SAMANTHA	It's great.
SAMANTHA	He's open to all sexual experiences.
SAMANTHA	He's evolved.
SAMANTHA	It's hot.
IRANDA	It's greedy.
IRANDA	He's double-dipping.
SAMANTHA	"You're not marrying him, you're making out with him."
SAMANTHA	Forget the label.
CARRIE	You're right.
CHARLOTTE	I'm very into labels.
CHARLOTTE	Gay.
CHARLOTTE	Straight.
CHARLOTTE	Pick a side and stay there.
IRANDA	Where are you going?
IRANDA	Home.
IRANDA	I've got a date with my remote control.
IRANDA	Steve's playing basketball.
IRANDA	That's three hours of alone time.
CARRIE	What about my problem?
IRANDA	Stop kissing him.
CARRIE	Easy for her to say.
CARRIE	"That night, I couldn't get Samantha's words out of my head."
CARRIE	"Was Sean's generation on to something? Was sexual flipping the wave of the future? If it was, could I play that game or was I over the hill? If women can transform into men, and men into women and we can sleep with everyone, then maybe gender doesn't exist anymore."
CARRIE	"If we can take the best of the other sex and make it our own, has the opposite sex become obsolete? Don't bust my balls."
SAMANTHA	"If you're a head-hunter, get me a good assistant."
SAMANTHA	Yeah?
ATT	I'm looking for a Mrs.
ATT	Jones.
SAMANTHA	It's Miss.
ATT	I'm here for the assistant job.
SAMANTHA	"Please, come in."
CARRIE	Samantha hired Matt five minutes later.
CARRIE	"She was the man of the office, but she could fit one more."
CARRIE	"Meanwhile downtown, Charlotte could have used some help herself."
BAIRD 	Someone is being industrious.
CHARLOTTE	Hi.
CHARLOTTE	I didn't hear you come in.
BAIRD 	I thought I'd come by and scare the shit out of you.
BAIRD 	Pick up my cheque for the pieces I sold.
CHARLOTTE	here.
BAIRD 	Thanks.
BAIRD 	There's something else.
BAIRD 	I've been thinking about this.
BAIRD 	I would love you to pose for me.
CHARLOTTE	as a man?
BAIRD 	"Yeah, you'd be great."
CHARLOTTE	"No, I don't think so."
BAIRD 	Why not?
CHARLOTTE	I'm not
BAIRD 	a model?
CHARLOTTE	"No, butch"
BAIRD 	You'd be surprised.
BAIRD 	Every woman has a male inside.
BAIRD 	Even you.
CHARLOTTE	"No, not me."
CHARLOTTE	I'm really bad at math and I can't change a tire to save my life.
BAIRD 	Pose for me.
BAIRD 	I'll get it out of you.
BAIRD 	"Come on, be a man."
CARRIE	"The next night, Sean and I went to a club so new, even I hadn't heard of it."
CARRIE	What's the name of this place?
SEAN	"""Hair""."
CARRIE	like the musical.
SEAN	like the stuff on your head.
CARRIE	You're too cool for me.
SEAN	You're too cute for me.
CARRIE	Ten seconds of kissing and I almost forgot his lack of sexual orientation.
CARRIE	Until we stopped kissing.
CARRIE	"Who are you checking out, the guy or the girl?"
SEAN	I was looking for the bathroom.
CARRIE	Oh.
CARRIE	Sorry.
CARRIE	I'm sorry.
CARRIE	"Sorry, this whole bisexual thing is throwing me for a loop."
CARRIE	You've been with men and women ?
CARRIE	Were you just looking at that guy
SEAN	I'm looking at you.
SEAN	I'm with you.
SEAN	I dig you.
CARRIE	"""Dig"" is in again?"
SEAN	"So is ""groovy""."
SEAN	You're that too.
CARRIE	"So, you're not gay?"
SEAN	I've been in three major relationships.
SEAN	One was a guy.
SEAN	That's just me.
CARRIE	"An hour later, Sean was in my bed."
CARRIE	That's just me.
SEAN	Nice floor.
CARRIE	Thanks.
CARRIE	It's a rental.
SEAN	what?
CARRIE	Nothing.
SEAN	Tell me or I'll make you go skating again.
CARRIE	do I kiss better than a Guy?
SEAN	Better than any I've kissed.
SEAN	How about me?
CARRIE	Top two per cent.
SEAN	I'll take that.
CARRIE	"If there was this good-looking guy walking towards you and across the street was a beautiful girl, which one ."
SEAN	"Carrie, come on"
SEAN	Could you stop making this all about sex? It's not.
SEAN	It's about the personyou.
SEAN	I'm crazy about you.
SEAN	The way you smell.
SEAN	The way your upper lip tastes.
CARRIE	"It may not have been all about sex, but it was for the next two hours."
CARRIE	I wasn't the only one with younger men on the brain.
ATT	Listen to me.
ATT	We've called your boss three times already.
ATT	Give him that message.
ATT	Hello.
ATT	What are you doing?
SAMANTHA	That is not how I do business.
ATT	she makes me crazy.
SAMANTHA	These are important clients.
SAMANTHA	Don't talk to them like that.
ATT	You want them to call you?
SAMANTHA	Let me remind you that I am the boss here.
ATT	Fire me.
ATT	I just think you deserve some respect.
SAMANTHA	Put this file away.
CARRIE	"Samantha found Matt's boyish arrogance annoying, unprofessionaland incredibly hot."
CARRIE	Miranda was having a problem sharing a space with the other sex.
STEVE	What?
STEVE	What's going on?
IRANDA	You're on my side.
IRANDA	My pillow.
IRANDA	My guest pillow.
STEVE	"OK, I'll tell you what."
STEVE	Tomorrow we'll buy some paint and draw a line down the middle.
STEVE	Go to sleep.
IRANDA	That pile.
IRANDA	Your stuff.
IRANDA	You have to keep it neater.
STEVE	Maybe if you can spare a drawer I can keep my things out of the way.
IRANDA	You want a drawer?
STEVE	Actually I'd like to move in.
CARRIE	Most single women dream of this moment.
CARRIE	Most single women but Miranda.
IRANDA	Wow! OK.
IRANDA	Where did that come from?
STEVE	I've been thinking about it.
STEVE	We have a great time.
STEVE	We're practically live together
IRANDA	"Yeah, but we're not."
IRANDA	Look.
IRANDA	We just started dating again.
IRANDA	There is no need to go at warp speed.
IRANDA	Nobody's dying.
IRANDA	I'm sure every book would say we're not ready.
IRANDA	You're here all the time.
STEVE	No problem.
STEVE	I'll get out of your hair.
STEVE	I'll leave the key.
IRANDA	No! Don't leave the key.
IRANDA	Take the key.
IRANDA	I just I need my space.
IRANDA	I feel like I'm being suffocated.
STEVE	"Jesus, Miranda It's like you're the guy sometimes."
CARRIE	"Faced with relationship problems, some women turn to fried food."
CARRIE	"Miranda turned to the latest fitness craze ""The Goddess Workout""."
GODDESS INSTRUCTOR	"Ladies, open up your chakras."
GODDESS INSTRUCTOR	Let the inner goddess sing.
GODDESS INSTRUCTOR	She's in there.
GODDESS INSTRUCTOR	All you have to do is let her out.
CARRIE	this helps You to be a woman?
IRANDA	I must find my inner goddess.
GODDESS INSTRUCTOR	And pop your hip.
GODDESS INSTRUCTOR	Pop your hip.
GODDESS INSTRUCTOR	Open yourself like a lotus flower.
GODDESS INSTRUCTOR	"Come on, pop your hip."
GODDESS INSTRUCTOR	Pop your hip.
IRANDA	"My hips don't pop, I'm a guy."
CARRIE	You're insane.
IRANDA	"This isn't helping me find my inner goddess, only my inner humiliation."
GODDESS INSTRUCTOR	And reach back.
GODDESS INSTRUCTOR	Reach for the stars.
CARRIE	We're out of here.
IRANDA	I'm never gonna be a girly girl.
IRANDA	I never will.
IRANDA	I'll never be a lotus flower.
CARRIE	Thank god.
IRANDA	A girly girl would want her boyfriend to move in.
CARRIE	She also wears make-up to the gym.
IRANDA	"And makes little hearts above her ""i's""."
IRANDA	I do love him I do.
CARRIE	I know.
IRANDA	What's my problem?
CARRIE	In any relationship one person is the alpha dog.
CARRIE	The one in chargethat's you.
CARRIE	You don't like sharing your water dish.
IRANDA	I'm very free with the chew toys.
CARRIE	That You are.
CARRIE	Miranda arrived home later to an empty apartment.
CARRIE	"And for the first time, she really didn't like it."
CARRIE	"While Miranda and I worked out our inner goddesses, Baird was working the male out of Charlotte."
BAIRD 	You look great.
CHARLOTTE	"I'm sorry, I can't do this."
BAIRD 	Just relax.
BAIRD 	Let it go.
BAIRD 	Forget Charlotte.
BAIRD 	You're a man now.
BAIRD 	You're a hot guy.
BAIRD 	You can get any woman you want.
BAIRD 	"You're rich, you're powerful."
BAIRD 	You eat guys like me for lunch.
BAIRD 	How are you feeling now?
CHARLOTTE	I think I need a bigger sock.
BAIRD 	"I think you do, too."
BAIRD 	Better?
CHARLOTTE	Much.
CARRIE	Who knows whether it was the sock or the suit or Baird.
CARRIE	"Charlotte wasn't just a chick with a dick, she was a chick with balls."
CARRIE	The two alpha dogs at Samantha's were not getting along as well.
SAMANTHA	These invitations need to go to the printers ASAP.
ATT	I'll get to it.
SAMANTHA	Now.
SAMANTHA	Drop them at 72nd Street then pick up lunch.
ATT	They're in opposite directions.
ATT	I'll get lunch first.
SAMANTHA	lnvitations first.
SAMANTHA	"Fine, then I'll be an hour late."
SAMANTHA	Do you realize you're my assistant? Your job is to do what I say.
ATT	I know what I'm doing.
SAMANTHA	and I know better.
ATT	Say's who?
SAMANTHA	me.
ATT	who do You think You are?
SAMANTHA	your boss.
ATT	Samantha Jones' PR.
ATT	I don't know when she will.
ATT	She's been busy.
ATT	You have a shitty attitude too.
ATT	And your parties suck.
SAMANTHA	"The bad news is, you're fired."
SAMANTHA	The good news is now I can fuck you.
CARRIE	The only place Samantha and Matt worked well together was in bed.
SAMANTHA	Fuck me on the desk.
ATT	on the chair.
SAMANTHA	"No, on the desk."
CARRIE	"With Sam on top, naturally."
CARRIE	"That night, Miranda invited Steve for pasta."
IRANDA	Hi.
IRANDA	I'm late.
IRANDA	I know I'm late.
STEVE	It's OK.
IRANDA	"I was gonna make you dinner, and then this conference call went over two hours."
IRANDA	I went to the market.
IRANDA	I needed extra virgin olive oil.
IRANDA	They only had virgin.
IRANDA	I don't know the difference.
IRANDA	I don't cook.
IRANDA	So I got the stuff in a jar.
STEVE	Don't move.
STEVE	It's glass.
IRANDA	I can't.
IRANDA	I can't do this.
STEVE	"We'll order pizza, it's no big deal."
IRANDA	It's a big fucking deal.
IRANDA	I just spilled Marinara sauce and you saw that.
IRANDA	"I drop things, OK?"
STEVE	OK.
STEVE	So do l.
IRANDA	I do love you.
IRANDA	But I've never lived with anybody before.
IRANDA	And I'm stubborn.
IRANDA	And I like the remote.
IRANDA	And I can't cook.
IRANDA	I don't do laundry sometimes for two weeks.
IRANDA	And my sponges smell.
IRANDA	You're gonna see all that.
IRANDA	I'm scared.
IRANDA	"I don't know if I can move forward, but I don't want to lose you."
STEVE	OK.
STEVE	I'm not going anywhere.
IRANDA	I'm crying on your shoulder.
IRANDA	I guess I really am a woman.
CARRIE	"A week later, Miranda's man moved into her place."
CARRIE	The same day that Charlotte moved her man into her place.
CARRIE	She never saw Baird again.
CARRIE	She was too embarrassed at how forward she'd been.
CARRIE	She might have been that type of guy but never that type of woman.
CARRIE	Sean and I were almost at the party.
SEAN	"One more floor, I promise."
CARRIE	"If there's no vodka, it's your head."
SEAN	"Take it easy, dude, we're here."
CARRIE	"OK, dude."
CARRIE	Who's party is this?
SEAN	Mark's.
CARRIE	"Mark, ex-boyfriend Mark?"
SEAN	Is that a problem? It's his boyfriend's birthday.
CARRIE	It was definitely a first.
CARRIE	I was attending a party of my boyfriend's ex-boyfriend.
CARRIE	And his boyfriend.
SEAN	"Carrie, this is Mark and his boyfriend Garth."
GARTH	Partner.
ARK	"this is our baby, lsabell."
ARK	"Two ""L's"", no ""E""."
CARRIE	OK.
CARRIE	Happy birthday.
GARTH	this is Dawn and Grace.
ARK	they Just got married in Hawaii.
CARRIE	Congratulations.
GRACE	It was a spur Of the moment.
DAWN	I didn't want another big wedding.
GARTH	It wasn't so bad.
DAWN	Being married to You sucked.
CARRIE	You two were
GARTH	Married.
GARTH	For a year.
GARTH	"We were high for most of it, otherwise it would've been miserable."
DAWN	Don't forget I gave you that egg.
GARTH	"This is our straight friend, Joel."
JOEL	are You wearing pleather?
CARRIE	Thank You for noticing.
CARRIE	"An hour later, I had almost got it straight."
CARRIE	Grace once dated Brett.
CARRIE	and Brett used to live with Joel?
SEAN	Semi -platonically.
CARRIE	You slept with Dawn.
SEAN	before she was with Mark.
CARRIE	Naturally.
CARRIE	"Gay, bi, straight."
CARRIE	This party was a platter of sexual orientation.
WOMAN	Time to play.
CARRIE	play what?
SEAN	Spin the bottle.
CARRIE	Seventh grade spin the bottle?
DAWN	Play.
DAWN	It's fun.
SEAN	"Come on, it's fun."
SEAN	Get a room.
GRACE	Get a dental dam.
CARRIE	It's a girl.
CARRIE	Try again.
DAWN	It's OK.
CARRIE	Of course it was.
CARRIE	I was in Alice-ln-Confused-Sexuality Land.
CARRIE	I had a choice.
CARRIE	"I could stand up, walk out and prove I was an old fart."
CARRIE	Or I could fall down the rabbit hole.
CARRIE	So I fell.
CARRIE	It wasn't bad.
CARRIE	Kind of like chicken.
SEAN	Where are you going? It's your spin.
CARRIE	Just more cigarettes.
CARRIE	That was the last night I saw Sean.
CARRIE	"They could do what they wanted, but I was too old to play this game."
CARRIE	"So I took my hot, old fart-ass home"
CARRIE	"One reason why people still risk the possible horror of a first date, is the possible magic of the good-night kiss at the front door."
CHARLOTTE	I had a great time.
BRAD	So did l.
CARRIE	The world slows down for a second as some people take that hopeful lean into a possible future together.
CHARLOTTE	All around my mouth.
CHARLOTTE	How do you think I felt? His tongue licked my teeth.
SAMANTHA	Did he wanna fuck you or floss you?
IRANDA	Bad kissers are the worst.
CARRIE	The worst.
CARRIE	The top of the worst.
CHARLOTTE	He has sweet lips.
CHARLOTTE	I thought he'd be a good kisser.
CARRIE	You can never tell.
CARRIE	They look normal.
IRANDA	Until their pointy tongue darts in and out.
CARRIE	"Pointy tongue, the worst of the worst."
SAMANTHA	The worst is when they expect you to do the work.
SAMANTHA	Their tongue lays in your mouth Iike a clam.
CARRIE	Clam-mouth.
CARRIE	That's the worst.
SAMANTHA	"I'd say, ""Get it out, put it in a cab and take its lazy ass home."
CHARLOTTE	You'd dump a guy for a bad kiss?
SAMANTHA	You have to.
SAMANTHA	"If their tongue just lays there, what is their dick gonna do?"
CARRIE	Point taken.
CHARLOTTE	Maybe we can work on it.
SAMANTHA	A bad kisser is a non-negotiable.
CHARLOTTE	I'm not dumping Brad because of that.
SAMANTHA	Then change his name from Brad to Bad.
CHARLOTTE	I like him.
CHARLOTTE	"Well, I did until"
IRANDA	Until his tongue was in your stomach?
ADEENA	Can you ladies hold it down? This is a respectable restaurant.
CARRIE	Adeena Williams was my newspaper's former food editor.
CARRIE	"And the chef and owner of Fusion, whose specialty was a mingling of trendy food with soul food."
CARRIE	Martha Stewart meets Puff Daddy on a plate.
ADEENA	Poached salmon with okra
SAMANTHA	Heaven.
ADEENA	"This time next year, okra will be so fashionable."
CHIVON	We are leaving.
CHIVON	Come and say goodbye.
ADEENA	"This is my brother, who brings me tons of music industry business."
ADEENA	"I gotta go, but I'm sending dessert."
CARRIE	no.
ADEENA	Pecan and praline pie.
CARRIE	Yes!
CHIVON	Didn't we meet at the Columbia Records party for Jennifer Lopez?
SAMANTHA	I don't think so.
SAMANTHA	My PR firm handled it.
SAMANTHA	I'm sure I'd have remembered you.
CHIVON	I guess I just sawyou.
CHIVON	"Chivon Williams, I used to rep for Tommy Boy Records."
SAMANTHA	I remember from the guest list.
CHIVON	You're good.
SAMANTHA	"Samantha Jones, if You need me for a party."
CHIVON	"Ladies, I apologize for interrupting."
CHIVON	Have a pleasant evening.
IRANDA	Could he any be cuter?
CARRIE	Gotta love a fella who loves jewellery.
SAMANTHA	That is one fine-looking man.
SAMANTHA	I'd like some of that.
CHARLOTTE	Don't talk like that.
SAMANTHA	like what?.
SAMANTHA	Relax with the liberal reaction
SAMANTHA	That's not black talk.
SAMANTHA	It's sex talk.
CHARLOTTE	"First of all, it isn't black talk."
CHARLOTTE	It's African-American talk.
CHARLOTTE	You shouldn't be talking like that.
CHARLOTTE	It's rude and politically incorrect.
CARRIE	Samantha is rude and politically incorrect.
IRANDA	She's an equal opportunity offender.
SAMANTHA	Precisely.
SAMANTHA	I don't see color.
SAMANTHA	I see conquests.
CARRIE	Talk about affirmative action.
CARRIE	"The next day I had just settled down with a cup of fresh coffee and a coffee table full of fashion magazines, when Who is it?"
STANFORD	Mr Right.
STANFORD	"Have you seen ""The New York Times"" style section?"
CARRIE	I can't handle hard news before noon.
STANFORD	"There's a beautiful man downtown, selling furniture."
STANFORD	We're going.
CARRIE	"I got a whole afternoon planned with Australian ""Vogue""."
CARRIE	I'm not gonna drop everything to go to see some cute guy.
STANFORD	He's straight.
CARRIE	I'll get my purse.
CARRIE	People with nothing better to do than ogle some craftsman.
CARRIE	Pathetic.
STANFORD	Look at this place.
STANFORD	Nothing but baguettes and faggots.
STANFORD	"If you see anything you like, say you're a designer."
STANFORD	You get a discount.
STANFORD	I got $50 off my end table.
CARRIE	You're a classy guy.
CARRIE	His name was Aidan.
CARRIE	"He was warm, masculine and classic American."
CARRIE	Like his furniture.
CARRIE	The dog is overkill.
STANFORD	Go get him.
CARRIE	Excuse me?
STANFORD	He's perfect for you.
STANFORD	I'll visit you and the kids at your cabin up state.
CARRIE	We're staring.
CARRIE	Look away.
CARRIE	His name was Marty Mendleson.
CARRIE	"He was warm, stylish and classic gay."
CARRIE	Like his outfit.
STANFORD	He's a designer.
STANFORD	And single.
STANFORD	Go get him.
STANFORD	I'll come visit you in your cabin up state.
CARRIE	"Hey, doggie."
CARRIE	Hi.
CARRIE	Bad doggie.
CARRIE	Down.
AIDAN	"Pete, there you go."
CARRIE	You should get him a chewtoy.
AIDAN	"To his credit, he picks the best-looking ladies."
CARRIE	You can't imagine howflattered I am.
AIDAN	I'm Aidan.
CARRIE	I'm humiliated.
AIDAN	I shouldn't let him run loose in the store.
CARRIE	This is your store? I had no idea.
CARRIE	"When I heard the lie come out of my mouth, I knew I was interested."
CARRIE	this is a Beautiful chair.
AIDAN	this is my Favorite piece.
CARRIE	"You say that about every piece, right?"
AIDAN	Not really
AIDAN	This leather is about 100 years old.
AIDAN	I stripped it off an old railroad car seat.
AIDAN	Feel this.
AIDAN	Soft?
CARRIE	I'll take it.
CARRIE	I wasn't really in the market for a leather chair.
CARRIE	But I had to have whatever it was I just felt.
CARRIE	I'm a designer.
CARRIE	Carrie Bradshaw.
CARRIE	Carrie Bradshaw Designs.
AIDAN	Let's see.
AIDAN	With the designer discount and dog humiliation factor How's that? .
CARRIE	how Soon can It be delivered?
AIDAN	end Of the week
CARRIE	"In New York City retail lingo, that meant ""l like you too""."
AIDAN	Where do you want it delivered and can I take you out for dinner?
CARRIE	"Will you knock another $10 off? The dog humping aside, it was one of those perfect New York Saturdays."
IRANDA	I'm back!
CARRIE	"At Miranda's, Steve was having an even better Saturday."
STEVE	Guess what happened? It's so great!
IRANDA	What?
STEVE	"You know at the Knicks game, somebody makes a half-court shot for a million dollars?"
IRANDA	"Kind of, but go ahead."
STEVE	"Next Tuesday, it's me."
STEVE	They picked my name from the contest I entered at Sam Goodies.
IRANDA	Great!
STEVE	It's not great.
STEVE	A million dollars.
STEVE	It's fucking great.
IRANDA	It is fucking great.
IRANDA	But don't get your hopes up.
IRANDA	"It's a tough shot, isn't it?"
STEVE	"For other guys, but they don't have my moves."
STEVE	The problem is you don't know how good I am.
STEVE	Don't let these legs fool you.
STEVE	I'm great.
IRANDA	I like your little legs.
STEVE	Let's go to the playground.
STEVE	I'll showyou.
IRANDA	"No, please."
IRANDA	I believe you.
IRANDA	You've got the moves.
STEVE	I don't want no charity.
STEVE	Seeing is believing.
STEVE	"Next week, come to the playground and watch me shoot."
STEVE	Promise? Promise?
IRANDA	That's Ralph Lauren paint.
STEVE	I'll buy you more.
STEVE	I'm a millionaire.
CARRIE	I have a crush.
IRANDA	Yeah?
CARRIE	Yeah.
IRANDA	You haven't had a crush in a while.
IRANDA	Not since Big.
CARRIE	"Big wasn't a crush, he was a crash."
CARRIE	His name is Aidan.
CARRIE	And I believe him to be very cute.
CARRIE	"So cute, I bought a chair I couldn't afford just because he made it."
IRANDA	Did he ask you out? So the chair is a write-off.
IRANDA	I haven't had a crush since Sean Cassidy.
CARRIE	No way.
IRANDA	At this age I'd have to say I'm crush-proof.
CARRIE	What about Steve?
IRANDA	I forgot about my boyfriend.
IRANDA	Is that normal?
CARRIE	You're asking me?
IRANDA	Steve thinks he's gonna win a million dollars.
CARRIE	You told me.
IRANDA	I have to repeat It until I believe it.
IRANDA	It's totally illogical and he wants me to be supportive.
IRANDA	It's a half-court shot.
IRANDA	There are Knicks who can't make it.
IRANDA	"I would support a real dream, like opening his own bar."
IRANDA	This is silly.
CARRIE	"Isn't that what you couples do, support each other's silly dreams?"
IRANDA	You're asking me?
CARRIE	"That week, Chivon invited Samantha to go uptown and hear an artist he was thinking of signing."
LINE PATRON	"Back in the line, motherfucker."
CARRIE	"Although Samantha had been in the club scene for years, she'd never been asked to spread without being offered a cocktail."
CHIVON	This is DJ Oldman.
CARRIE	"In a matter of minutes, Samantha felt at home in Chivon's world."
SAMANTHA	"Hi, guys."
SAMANTHA	I'm Samantha.
CARRIE	"In a matter of hours, Chivon was at home in Samantha's home."
CHIVON	Do you like this groove? It's the new kid.
SAMANTHA	It's so soft.
SAMANTHA	I thought all rap had a harder edge.
CHIVON	"They can be hard or soft, like you."
CHIVON	You have so much attitude up front.
CHIVON	Look at you now.
CHIVON	"Soft, sweet"
SAMANTHA	"Sweet, me?"
CHIVON	Who do you think you're fooling?
SAMANTHA	I don't usually sleep with men who have nicer accessories than me.
SAMANTHA	Where did you get these fabulous earrings?
CHIVON	Tiffany.
SAMANTHA	Where else? I hope you can sleep in a little.
CHIVON	Sleep? .
CARRIE	"Samantha rarely asked a man to stay over, but she couldn't resist having breakfast with his Tiffanies"
CARRIE	"One reason some people still risk the possible horror of a first date, is the possible magic of the good-night kiss at the front door."
AIDAN	My dog is obsessed with you.
AIDAN	He kept me up talking all night.
AIDAN	"""Her leg, man."
AIDAN	""" I had to say, ""Pete, let her go."
AIDAN	It's over.
CARRIE	""" I have a confession to make I'm not a designer."
CARRIE	I'm a writer.
AIDAN	What was that? Fiction?
CARRIE	I wanted the discount.
CARRIE	"It's shameful, but true."
CARRIE	"But don't worry, I only lie about furniture, nothing else."
CARRIE	Are you upset?
AIDAN	You smoke?
CARRIE	Just a little.
CARRIE	"When the lie came out of my mouth, I realised how much I liked him."
CARRIE	"If it bothers you, I'll just"
CARRIE	I had a great time.
AIDAN	I can taste That cigarette.
CARRIE	"I'm sorry, I have an Altoid."
AIDAN	I think you're
CARRIE	I totally get it.
CARRIE	I have a mint here.
CARRIE	They are curiously strong.
CARRIE	can You Just Hold that?
AIDAN	Sure.
AIDAN	"I don't wanna be a jerk, but I can't date a smoker."
CARRIE	So Really?
AIDAN	It's a thing I have.
CARRIE	I couldn't believe what my crush was saying.
CARRIE	I was crushed.
CARRIE	"Later that night, I wondered When did dating become so dump-friendly? What happened to the time when a bad kiss or a cigarette or a ridiculous dream was part of a person's portfolio? In today's dating market, is it wise to liquidate certain stocks, the first sign they might not perform as well as expected? Or are there things one should try and negotiate? In relationships, what are the ""deal breakers""?"
CHARLOTTE	I think it's really sexy when you lightly touch your lips to mine.
CARRIE	"Never one to trade a stock before it had matured, a determined and patient Charlotte tried to teach Bad how to kiss good."
BRAD	You like that?
CHARLOTTE	And I like it when you slowly open your mouth and just tickle my lips with the tip of your tongue.
BRAD	You like that?
CARRIE	"With just a little negotiating, Brad's stock suddenly began to rise."
CHARLOTTE	Stop it! You're sucking too hard.
CHARLOTTE	And my mouth is up here.
BRAD	is There a problem?
CHARLOTTE	I can't do this.
CHARLOTTE	You're a bad kisser.
BRAD	It's my thing.
BRAD	Where are you going?
CARRIE	"Downtown at Marty Mendleson's, others were experiencing a much more successful first kiss."
ARTY	Let's move it to the bedroom.
ARTY	These are my dolls.
ARTY	I've been collecting them for years.
STANFORD	I had no idea.
ARTY	Thisis the Queen of Siam.
ARTY	She's my favorite.
ARTY	Bisque china face.
ARTY	She's a real collector's item.
ARTY	"And thisis Mary, Queen of Scots."
STANFORD	are they All queens?
ARTY	The ones from Madame Alexander's.
ARTY	"Help me clear the bed? No, the Southern Belle sits on the table."
CARRIE	"Was Stanford enough of a queen to sleep with one who collected queens? Uptown at Fusion, Samantha felt a bit like a queen herself."
CHIVON	Did I tell you how beautiful you look tonight?
SAMANTHA	Thank you.
CHIVON	"What's up, genius?"
ADEENA	Genius' over-tired ass is dragging all over this restaurant.
ADEENA	"Aunt Alice and her friends are leaving, if you want to pay your respects."
CHIVON	Favorite aunt.
CHIVON	I'll introduce you.
ADEENA	Aunt Alice is out of the door already.
ADEENA	You go and I'll talk with Samantha.
ADEENA	How is everything?
SAMANTHA	"Chivon is right, you are a genius."
ADEENA	Thank you.
ADEENA	A non-food related question.
ADEENA	What's going on between you and Chivon?
SAMANTHA	What do You mean?
ADEENA	You've been in here three times.
SAMANTHA	"Well, we're dating."
SAMANTHA	Why?
ADEENA	You're not just fucking?
SAMANTHA	"Not that's any of your business, but no, we're not just fucking."
SAMANTHA	We actually really like each other.
ADEENA	I don't want you seeing my brother.
SAMANTHA	Excuse me?
ADEENA	I don't approve.
SAMANTHA	You don't know me
ADEENA	Let's not get personal.
ADEENA	"I'm sure you're a nice person, but you're white."
ADEENA	I have a problem with my brother getting serious with a white woman.
CARRIE	"To Adeena, Samantha's skin was a non-negotiable."
SAMANTHA	how can You say that?
ADEENA	That's how I feel.
ADEENA	I'm never going to approve and my approval means a lot to my brother.
ADEENA	Just save us the time and trouble and get out before anybody gets hurt.
ADEENA	I'll send over some Mississippi mud pie.
CARRIE	The only place Adeena was interested in fusion was on a plate.
SAMANTHA	She can't dis me just cos I'm white.
CARRIE	Please tell me you didn't say dis.
CHARLOTTE	Maybe you should stop seeing him.
CHARLOTTE	Race is a big issue.
SAMANTHA	There is no reason to bring race into this.
SAMANTHA	Chivon is a sweet man.
SAMANTHA	We have great sex.
SAMANTHA	He happens to have the biggest
CHARLOTTE	Black cock.
CHARLOTTE	We know he has a big black cock.
SAMANTHA	I was about to say the biggest heart.
SAMANTHA	"But, yes, he does have a big black cock."
IRANDA	It's big African-American cock.
CHARLOTTE	Don't make fun of me.
CHARLOTTE	My chin hurts.
CARRIE	What happened?
CHARLOTTE	He raped my face.
CHARLOTTE	I'm never seeing him again.
CARRIE	"To Charlotte, a black and blue chin was a deal breaker."
SAMANTHA	I'm not backing down to her.
SAMANTHA	That's not who I am.
CARRIE	She shouldn't sacrifice who she is because somebody has a problem.
CARRIE	Like me and smoking.
CARRIE	Too bad Aidan had a problem with it.
CARRIE	But you have to accept people for who they are.
IRANDA	You choose cigarettes over a Guy?
CARRIE	He's not that cute.
IRANDA	"You bought furniture, he was so cute."
CARRIE	For him to dump me over a little thing like smoking.
CHARLOTTE	Smoking is not a little thing.
CHARLOTTE	It's dirty and you're killing yourself.
CHARLOTTE	We hate it.
CHARLOTTE	We put up with it cos we love you.
CHARLOTTE	You have a reason to quit.
CARRIE	I don't like being ganged up on.
IRANDA	Who's ganging up on you?
CARRIE	Smoking is a part of who I am.
CARRIE	"I'll quit when I want to, not cos a cute guy told me to."
CARRIE	"Right, Samantha?"
SAMANTHA	no.
SAMANTHA	Fighting for Chivon is one thing.
SAMANTHA	Holding on to cigarettes is just wack.
IRANDA	"Tell me she didn't say ""wack""."
CARRIE	It's all total bullshit.
CARRIE	What is wrong with cigarettes?
STANFORD	"Nothing, they're fabulous."
STANFORD	It's not like you have a hideous doll-collection.
CARRIE	You think that's an overreaction to a repressed childhood?
STANFORD	Who cares? It's freaky.
STANFORD	I could overlook his receding hair.
STANFORD	But the dollies? No.
CARRIE	"So, it's ""Goodbye, Dolly""?"
STANFORD	It's too bad.
STANFORD	I kind of liked him.
CARRIE	"Well, Stannie, if I may call you that."
CARRIE	"Maybe you should reconsider? When was the last time someone you had a crush on asked you out? You're no one to talk, Miss Marlboro Lights."
CARRIE	You're right.
CARRIE	I am no one to talk.
CARRIE	"Maybe I could quit, just a little."
CARRIE	Till I see what's up.
CARRIE	Ettu?
STANFORD	Fine.
STANFORD	I can't see myself getting excited because my boyfriend's three-foot Lady Di doll is arriving from QVC.
STEVE	Let's go.
STEVE	Time to go shoot hoops.
IRANDA	I can't.
IRANDA	I got behind on this file.
STEVE	"No, you don't."
STEVE	You promised.
IRANDA	This has to be ready Monday.
IRANDA	I don't have time to watch you shoot hoops.
STEVE	I ask you to do one thing for me and you can't.
IRANDA	What is that? What's with the attitude?
STEVE	You know how many times I do what you want?
IRANDA	Why are you getting so upset? It's just a stupid shot.
STEVE	Not to me it's not.
STEVE	"Why are you always pessimistic? ""You can't make that shot."
IRANDA	""" Steve, come on."
STEVE	It's not just the shot.
STEVE	It's everything.
STEVE	"""We can't move in together."
STEVE	""" If this is ever gonna work, I need you to believe in us."
STEVE	"I need you to believe in me, even if you think it's fucking stupid."
IRANDA	"All right, hot shot."
IRANDA	Show me what you got.
IRANDA	Nice legs! Very nice!
STEVE	This is for the big money!
CARRIE	Steve never did win the big money at Madison Square Garden.
CARRIE	"But having Miranda show up, made him feel like a million bucks."
IRANDA	You were robbed! Do over! -
STEVE	OK.
CARRIE	Don't get any ideas.
AIDAN	Pete.
AIDAN	Let's go.
AIDAN	This isn't fair.
AIDAN	He was just starting to get over you.
CARRIE	"Since you negotiated such a good price for me on the chair, maybe I can negotiate a little deal for you on the smoking."
AIDAN	What kind of deal?
CARRIE	I've been thinking about quitting anyway.
CARRIE	Why not now? No cigarettes.
AIDAN	Can you do that?
CARRIE	Maybe you think I'm more of a smoker than I am.
CARRIE	I only have like a cigarette with cocktails.
AIDAN	I'm done here.
AIDAN	Do you wanna get some coffee?
CARRIE	"The second he said coffee, I knew I wanted a cigarette."
CARRIE	I'd love it.
CARRIE	"It was one of those dates when you have so much to say that coffee turns into a movie, a movie into a long walk and a long walk turns into the beginning of cold turkey rehab."
AIDAN	Would you like to eat some dinner?
CARRIE	I was completely ready to trade in my crush
AIDAN	Hi
CARRIE	when it dawned on me how much I was willing to give up for a cigarette.
CARRIE	Maybe a quick bite.
ARTY	Her name is Sheeba.
ARTY	She's French.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, back in the ""Valley of the Dolls"", Stanford thought there was something more rare than a porcelain face his passion."
ARTY	"Wait, the dolls."
CARRIE	"To Marty Mendleson, a broken face was a deal breaker."
CHIVON	Adeena!
CARRIE	Samantha was about to come face to face with her deal breaker.
CHIVON	What's up?
ADEENA	You Tell me.
ADEENA	I just got here.
CHIVON	You know Samantha.
CHIVON	What's my favorite girl drinking?
SAMANTHA	Champagne.
ADEENA	Marguerita.
CHIVON	Coming right up.
ADEENA	What are you doing here? I don't want you dating my brother.
SAMANTHA	I'm a lovely person.
SAMANTHA	"Get to know me, then hate me."
ADEENA	This is not a game.
ADEENA	This is my brother we're talking about.
SAMANTHA	For a woman with such a progressive view of world food -
ADEENA	"That's business, this is family."
SAMANTHA	I don't understand
ADEENA	I'll say it to you plain.
ADEENA	"I don't care how many Jennifer Lopez dresses you have hanging in your closet, you don't belong in here."
ADEENA	You'll never understand what I'm talking about.
ADEENA	This is a black thing.
ADEENA	Please go and leave my brother alone.
CARRIE	"As Samantha turned to leave, she realised this wasn't a black thing."
CARRIE	It was a Samantha thing.
CARRIE	She'd never backed down to a bitch and she wasn't about to start.
SAMANTHA	"No woman, no matter what color, has the right to tell me who I fuck."
ADEENA	Get your little white pussy away from my brother!
SAMANTHA	"Get your big, black ass out of my face! And your okra wasn't all that! Get off me!"
CHIVON	Keep it real.
SAMANTHA	I'm trying to keep it real.
CARRIE	"Seven hours into the world's longest date, all I could think was, ""Five more minutes and I can smoke the cigarette hidden in my purse."
AIDAN	""" Would you like a dessert menu?"
CARRIE	"I forgot, I have a deadline."
CARRIE	I have to go.
AIDAN	I'll walk with you.
CARRIE	I'm fine.
AIDAN	Carrie We've got a little problem.
CHIVON	What can I say? Adeena has always been there for me.
CHIVON	"Ever since Mom died, it's only been the two of us."
CHIVON	"Adeena has her issues, but you didn't have to insult her food."
CHIVON	You mean the world to me.
CHIVON	"But Adeena, she's my blood."
CARRIE	Samantha knewthe real problem wasn't her white pussy.
CARRIE	It was that Chivon was a black pussy who wouldn't stand up to his sister.
CARRIE	"And for Samantha Jones, that was the deal breaker."
CARRIE	It was too bad we had to end.
CARRIE	"But that's the way it goes, I guess."
CARRIE	We had some good times together and I'm sure we could have had more.
CARRIE	"But, it's over."
CARRIE	"In the end, I really did it for me."
CARRIE	I just hope he's worth it
CARRIE	You can count on one hand the things a New Yorker will wait for.
CARRIE	"My list includes: the perfect apartment, the chocolate souffle at Le Bernardin, and the annual Manolo Blahnik sale."
CARRIE	"After four dates with the furniture designer, whose kiss made my knees weak, this New Yorker had waited long enough."
CARRIE	"So, do you wanna sleep over?"
AIDAN	I have to feed Pete.
AIDAN	I have to get up early in the morning.
CARRIE	"Apparently, that New Yorker had not."
CARRIE	"When one door closes, another one opens."
CARRIE	"At 2:00am, the door that opened was Samantha's."
SAMANTHA	What's going on?
OLDER WOMAN	Freda in 1D was held up at gunpoint.
SAMANTHA	"Oh, my God!"
POLICEMAN	It's under control.
POLICEMAN	We have the suspect on tape.
SAMANTHA	This is supposed to be a safe building.
POLICEMAN	It was late.
POLICEMAN	Doorman was off duty.
POLICEMAN	He entered behind somebody's guest.
SAMANTHA	That's awful.
CARRIE	The guy came in behind the guy who came in Samantha.
SAMANTHA	That's terrible.
OLDER WOMAN	Who has a guest at 2:00am?
OTHER OLDER WOMAN	I have No idea.
IRANDA	What did Everybody do last night?
SAMANTHA	Nothing.
CARRIE	Nothing.
CHARLOTTE	I don't want to talk about it.
SAMANTHA	Did you sleep with someone on the second date?
CHARLOTTE	No.
CHARLOTTE	The third date.
CHARLOTTE	"Alexander Lemly, the investment banker I met at an art show."
CARRIE	the sex was bad?
CHARLOTTE	No.
CHARLOTTE	I don't think I can say it.
IRANDA	Get over yourself.
CARRIE	What happened?
CHARLOTTE	When he You know.
SAMANTHA	"Came, orgasmed, shot his wad."
CHARLOTTE	He said:
ALEXANDER LEMLEY	You fucking bitch! You fucking whore!
CHARLOTTE	Why Would he say that?
SAMANTHA	because You were fucking him?
CARRIE	"He didn't say it at the drycleaners, but when he was in you."
CHARLOTTE	Do you think I'm a whore?
SAMANTHA	"If you're a whore, what does that make me?"
CHARLOTTE	Do you think I'm a whore?
IRANDA	You have had a lot Of bone in you.
CHARLOTTE	This is bad.
CHARLOTTE	Nobody wants to marry a whore.
CARRIE	Even Charlotte is having more sex than me.
IRANDA	What about Aidan?
CARRIE	I don't knowwhat's going on.
CARRIE	We're spending a lot of time together.
CARRIE	He keeps asking me out.
CARRIE	But he doesn't wanna sleep with me.
SAMANTHA	gay.
CARRIE	He's not gay.
IRANDA	Mother issues?
CARRIE	I don't think so.
SAMANTHA	Maybe his dick curves to the Right.
CARRIE	We'll work it out.
CARRIE	I'll go left.
CARRIE	I may never know.
SAMANTHA	"Wait too long to sleep with someone, you become just friends."
IRANDA	"As supposed to his fucking bitch, his fucking whore."
SAMANTHA	Come on.
CARRIE	"If Samantha was right, I had little time left before the relationship-window closed."
CARRIE	So I wore my little dress that left little to the imagination.
CARRIE	Do you want to take this inside?
AIDAN	I better get home.
AIDAN	I gotta
CARRIE	You gotta get up early.
CARRIE	Whatever.
AIDAN	What's going on up there?
CARRIE	do You Just Wanna be friends?
AIDAN	I don't know.
AIDAN	Is that how you kiss your friends?
CARRIE	Why don't you wanna sleep with me? Whatever it is I'd rather know sooner than later.
AIDAN	I do wanna sleep with you.
AIDAN	I do.
AIDAN	Look at you.
AIDAN	I've been down that road before.
AIDAN	I've slept with women quickly and I'm still single.
AIDAN	"My new thing is, I want to try and sleep with somebody I care about."
AIDAN	I really think that I can care about you.
AIDAN	It's only been a week and a half.
AIDAN	Don't people date anymore?
CARRIE	Why did I expect to sleep with him after only a week and a half? Had I become so jaded that I didn't recognize romance when it kissed me on the lips? Modern women need a cheat-sheet to remind us romance isn't dead.
CARRIE	Romance.
CARRIE	"I tell you, it didn't even occur to me, which is so depressing."
CARRIE	Is that what 13 years of dating in Manhattan does to a woman?
IRANDA	I'll tell you what it does.
IRANDA	It gives you chlamydia.
CARRIE	Excuse me?
IRANDA	My gynecologist called me today.
IRANDA	"My tests, which she threw in for good measure, were positive."
IRANDA	It's not terrible.
IRANDA	"There aren't any symptoms, but it can cause infertility."
IRANDA	I guess it's good I caught it.
IRANDA	"I mean Not that I caught it, but that I found out."
CARRIE	You got It from Steve?.
IRANDA	I don't know
IRANDA	"It could be any number of guys, which is what I told my gynecologist."
IRANDA	She seemed a little judgmental.
IRANDA	"She told me to contact all the people that I might have given it to, so they can all be treated."
CARRIE	I knew what was bothering her.
CARRIE	The same thought had bothered me since the guy I'd been seeing for 10 days asked me to slow down.
CARRIE	"If you're a 30 something woman in Manhattan and you're sexually active, it's inevitable that you'll rack up a certain number of partners."
CARRIE	But how many is too many men? Are we simply romantically challenged or are we sluts? It was the question on Charlotte's mind.
ALEXANDER LEMLEY	How's your swordfish?.
CHARLOTTE	"Fine, Thanks"
ALEXANDER LEMLEY	You're awfully quiet tonight.
CHARLOTTE	"Sorry, my mind is somewhere else."
ALEXANDER LEMLEY	You fucking bitch! You fucking whore!
ALEXANDER LEMLEY	"I hate putting people out of work, but it happens after a merger."
ALEXANDER LEMLEY	Maybe I should teach ESL on the side.
ALEXANDER LEMLEY	Are you sure you're OK?
CHARLOTTE	Actuallywhat you said the other night kind of bothered me.
ALEXANDER LEMLEY	What did I say?
CHARLOTTE	You knowwhen we were in bed and you You yelled out something.
ALEXANDER LEMLEY	During my sleep?
CHARLOTTE	"No, During sex."
ALEXANDER LEMLEY	I don't remember saying anything.
ALEXANDER LEMLEY	I remember it being very nice.
ALEXANDER LEMLEY	What did I say?
CHARLOTTE	It's not important.
CHARLOTTE	I'm sure it was in the heat of the moment.
CHARLOTTE	Do you want to try my swordfish?
CHARLOTTE	It really is good.
CARRIE	"By dessert, Charlotte had decided to forget it and call it a do-over."
ALEXANDER LEMLEY	You fucking bitch! Fucking whore!.
CHARLOTTE	That! That's what you said
ALEXANDER LEMLEY	What? .
CHARLOTTE	Just then
CHARLOTTE	You said it again.
ALEXANDER LEMLEY	What did I say?
CHARLOTTE	"You fucking bitch, you fucking whore."
ALEXANDER LEMLEY	"My God, are you sure? That's terrible."
ALEXANDER LEMLEY	That's a horrible thing to say.
ALEXANDER LEMLEY	I had no idea.
ALEXANDER LEMLEY	I just get lost in the moment.
ALEXANDER LEMLEY	I don't think that about you.
ALEXANDER LEMLEY	"Believe me, you are sweet, smart and lovely."
ALEXANDER LEMLEY	You are the kind of woman I hope to marry some day.
ALEXANDER LEMLEY	I promise never to say that again.
ALEXANDER LEMLEY	That's terrible.
CARRIE	"As Charlotte started to feel better, Miranda started to feel worse."
IRANDA	"Steve, can we not?"
STEVE	I'm just getting started.
STEVE	I'm only at the neck.
STEVE	Maybe you'll change your mind when I'm down around your elbows.
IRANDA	"I can't tonight, I have chlamydia."
STEVE	"I don't even knowwhat that is, but it sounds like a problem."
IRANDA	It's not a big deal.
IRANDA	It's just a sexually transmitted disease.
IRANDA	I might have given it to you or you to me.
IRANDA	"Either way, you should get tested."
STEVE	I'm afraid of doctors.
STEVE	I don't even have one.
IRANDA	Go to the free clinic.
IRANDA	Whatever.
STEVE	"What's gonna happen, does it hurt when you pee?"
IRANDA	"Men are just Carriers, there aren't any symptoms at all."
STEVE	Then why do I need to know?
IRANDA	If you don't get treated you can pass it on to other people.
STEVE	"You are my only other person, and you already have it."
IRANDA	"Yeah, but if you've got it, we'll keep passing it back and forth."
IRANDA	I'd rather not sleep with you until it's out of my body.
IRANDA	I've got six more days of antibiotics.
IRANDA	Will you please just take care of it? Get it over with.
CARRIE	Steve's trip to the doctor didn't cure his fear of doctors.
DOCTOR	drop your trousers.
STEVE	There's nothing wrong down there.
STEVE	I'm here because my girlfriend said to get the test.
DOCTOR	I need a sample from the inside of your penis.
CARRIE	"As Steve faced something every man dreads, Miranda faced something every woman dreads."
CARRIE	She was making a list of all the men she'd slept with.
CARRIE	At least all the ones she could remember.
CARRIE	She wondered how she did all these men and did her law degree and became a successful lawyer.
CARRIE	Samantha knew her number was up there.
CARRIE	But she didn't know everybody else knew.
UPTIGHT WOMAN	We know it was you who buzzed in the gunman.
SAMANTHA	Excuse me?
UPTIGHT WOMAN	You always have guests.
UPTIGHT WOMAN	Every time I'm in this elevator you're with a different man.
SAMANTHA	That's ridiculous.
ELEVATOR MANSCALE	This is your floor.
SAMANTHA	Excuse me.
CARRIE	"The next day, Miranda's sex life was flashing before her as well."
IRANDA	Thanks.
IRANDA	OK.
IRANDA	Sorry to bother you.
IRANDA	Congratulations.
IRANDA	"Nowyou're married, you don't have to worry about stuff like this."
IRANDA	Bye-bye.
SECRETARY	"Miss Hobbes, line two is still holding."
IRANDA	Miranda Hobbes.
DAVID	"Hi, it's David, returning a call."
IRANDA	how have You been?
DAVID	"Lousy, I'm partner."
DAVID	"All work, no play."
DAVID	What do You want?
IRANDA	It's kind of awkward.
DAVID	"I'm busy, spit it out."
DAVID	What is it?
IRANDA	OK.
IRANDA	I've got this It's chlamydia.
IRANDA	Which is
DAVID	I know What chlamydia is.
IRANDA	Perhaps You should get tested.
DAVID	I've been tested.
IRANDA	Recently?
DAVID	Yes.
DAVID	Is that it?
IRANDA	Yes.
IRANDA	No Did you have it?
DAVID	"Is that your business? You call me after months to discuss my health? Yes, I had it."
DAVID	"So, what?"
IRANDA	Perhaps You gave It to me.
DAVID	"What are You gonna do, sue me?"
IRANDA	You Could have called.
DAVID	You told me never to call you.
IRANDA	now I remember why.
IRANDA	Bye!
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, I was still waiting for the diagnosis on my relationship."
CARRIE	Would Aidan become friend or boyfriend?
AIDAN	Delivery for Miss Bradshaw.
CARRIE	It's about time.
CARRIE	I ordered this years ago.
CARRIE	He certainly kissed like a boyfriend.
AIDAN	Don't you have two matching plates?
CARRIE	No.
AIDAN	"What do you use for wine, promotional coffee mugs?"
CARRIE	But he teased me like a friend.
AIDAN	Come here.
AIDAN	Let me get this.
CARRIE	Boyfriend.
AIDAN	I don't care what anybody says.
AIDAN	I think Catherine Zeta-Jones is hot.
CARRIE	Friend.
AIDAN	"Not as hot as you, but she's hot."
CARRIE	Boyfriend.
CARRIE	And liar.
CARRIE	I think Samantha was Right.
CHARLOTTE	about what?
CARRIE	Me and Aidan.
CARRIE	I think we're just friends who kiss occasionally.
CHARLOTTE	Why are You whispering?
CARRIE	Cos he's still here.
CHARLOTTE	That's promising.
CARRIE	He's been in the bathroom for half an hour.
CARRIE	"All we did was eat Chinese and watch ""Zorro""."
CARRIE	Now I'm working and he's reading the paper on the john.
CARRIE	"This isn't romance, this is bullshit."
AIDAN	Carrie! .
CARRIE	Yeah?
AIDAN	Come here a second
CARRIE	"I have to go, my friend wants to see me in the bathroom."
CARRIE	"What did you want, because Wow."
CARRIE	It's like a Danielle Steele novel in here.
AIDAN	"From a writer, I'm pretty sure that's an insult."
CARRIE	"No, this is Wow."
AIDAN	I thought a bath would help you relax.
AIDAN	You seemed kind of tense.
CARRIE	Are you sure this isn't just a cheap ploy to see me naked?
AIDAN	Will you be naked?
CARRIE	That's the thing about baths.
AIDAN	"This is about you, so enjoy."
AIDAN	I'm gonna get going.
AIDAN	But that doesn't make us friends cos I'll be thinking about you naked.
CARRIE	"Big tub, little person."
AIDAN	You talked me into it.
CARRIE	So nowwhat?
AIDAN	"Nowwhat, what? We're just taking a bath."
CARRIE	"Fuck it, let's just do it."
CARRIE	This isn't how it should happen.
CARRIE	You said this was just a bath.
AIDAN	"come on, who cares?"
CARRIE	You do.
CARRIE	And I do too now.
CARRIE	OK.
CARRIE	Out of the tub.
CARRIE	"The next night, Samantha was feeling exposed."
GROUP	Here she comes.
SAMANTHA	good evening.
OLDER HUSBAND	Hello.
SAMANTHA	"If you wanna say something about me, say it to my face."
OLDER WOMAN	You're bad for the building.
SAMANTHA	What? .
UPTIGHT WOMAN	You have Too many visitors
OLDER	There are always men in the hall.
FREDA	I got robbed because Of you.
FREDA	I can't close my left eye.
SAMANTHA	They practically chased me like I was Fuckenstein.
CARRIE	They can't evict you for having sex.
SAMANTHA	"They're jealous, dried up old farts who haven't had sex since Eisenhower."
SAMANTHA	I remind them of what they can't have.
SAMANTHA	It might be time to move.
CARRIE	You can't.
CARRIE	You have a rent-controlled apartment on the Upper East Side.
SAMANTHA	"This isn't rent control, it's life control."
CARRIE	"I have to go, I have a date with Aidan."
SAMANTHA	Don't tell me you're not having sex yet.
CARRIE	We're not having sex yet.
SAMANTHA	What are You doing?
CARRIE	"Tonight, we're going to a blues club."
SAMANTHA	"Who's singing, you?"
CARRIE	We'll have sex eventually.
CARRIE	"By the way, I got a little preview."
CARRIE	"I assure you, there is no curving in any direction."
CARRIE	It is straight.
CARRIE	Very straight.
CARRIE	"That night, Charlotte had a date as well."
CARRIE	"And he was doing his best to be the strong, silent type."
CHARLOTTE	What's the matter?
ALEXANDER LEMLEY	I'm afraid to come.
CHARLOTTE	What are you talking about? I'm close.
CHARLOTTE	Go ahead.
ALEXANDER LEMLEY	"You fucking bitch, you fucking whore! I hate myself, what's wrong with me?"
CARRIE	"That night, Alexander decided to stop seeing Charlotte and start seeing a therapist."
CARRIE	And Steve got his test back.
CARRIE	"It was negative, like the rest of the experience."
STEVE	That doctor with the swab Ouch! I don't even want to swab my ears.
IRANDA	It's my fault.
IRANDA	I'm the one with the disease.
IRANDA	"I'm a big, dirty, diseased whore."
STEVE	That's my girlfriend you're talking about.
IRANDA	You knowwhat? I had to make a list of all the guys I've slept with and it's not short.
STEVE	"How, not short?."
IRANDA	"It's No, I can't tell you"
IRANDA	I've never told anybody my number.
STEVE	I'm just curious.
IRANDA	You won't judge me?
STEVE	I spent a day at the free clinic.
IRANDA	OK.
IRANDA	"It's like, about42."
STEVE	42? That's not so bad.
IRANDA	That's too many.
STEVE	It's fine.
IRANDA	What's your number?
STEVE	I'm not telling you.
IRANDA	Come on.
STEVE	It's embarrassing.
STEVE	I've had enough embarrassment for one week.
IRANDA	What is it? Ten?
STEVE	Higher.
IRANDA	Sixty
STEVE	Higher
IRANDA	Higher than 60? A lot higher?
STEVE	I'm a bartender and I'm cute.
CARRIE	"Note, men who have had a lot of sexual partners are not called sluts."
CARRIE	They are called very good kissers.
CARRIE	A few are even called romantics.
AIDAN	I can't believe you've never been to the Blue Note.
AIDAN	call yourself a New Yorker.
CARRIE	I've never done a lot of things.
AIDAN	I can think of one thing in particular.
CARRIE	That I've done.
AIDAN	I can think Of one other thing.
AIDAN	What do you think about me staying the night?
CARRIE	I don't know.
CARRIE	What about Pete?
AIDAN	I arranged for the super's kid to walk Pete and feed him.
CARRIE	And you knewthis all night? And then something weird happened.
CARRIE	"For the first time in a long time, I was nervous."
CARRIE	We were going to sleep together and it was going to mean something.
CARRIE	"I was no virgin, but this was definitely virgin territory."
AIDAN	Good morning.
CARRIE	Good morning.
AIDAN	"OK, that's what I wanted."
AIDAN	Bye.
CARRIE	"The nice thing about a new relationship, it's a clean slate."
CARRIE	"And speaking of clean slates, Samantha moved to the trendy Meatpacking District."
SAMANTHA	"Good morning, ladies."
CARRIE	"Whores were whores, men were women and rents higher."
SAMANTHA	"Easy, that's my bed."
CARRIE	It happened two days ago.
CARRIE	Aidan and I had been seeing each other for three weeks when
AIDAN	What is it? bad dream?
CARRIE	I'm not sure.
AIDAN	What's wrong?
CARRIE	I don't know.
CARRIE	The truth was I really didn't.
CARRIE	"The next day I searched for unpaid bills, unanswered calls, unmet deadlines."
CARRIE	But I hadn't so much as missed a teeth cleaning.
CARRIE	My life appeared to be in order.
CARRIE	"But the next night, like clockwork I realized I was in an existential crisis."
CARRIE	One that not even the sight of this season's Dolce & Gabbana sandals could lift me out of.
CARRIE	Do you wanna spend the night?
CARRIE	I'm gonna get some water.
AIDAN	Relax.
AIDAN	I'll get it.
CARRIE	Then I realized it.
CARRIE	"What was wrong was, for the first time in my life, I was in a relationship where absolutely nothing was wrong."
CARRIE	It's smooth sailing.
CARRIE	"Nothing but calm seas, blue horizons."
CARRIE	See what I'm saying?
IRANDA	Absolutely.
IRANDA	Not a cloud in sight.
CARRIE	We adore each other.
CARRIE	We have fun.
CARRIE	We mesh.
CHARLOTTE	And this is a problem?
CARRIE	It feels odd.
CARRIE	I'm used to the hunt.
CARRIE	This iseffortless.
CARRIE	It's freaking me out.
SAMANTHA	I totally understand.
SAMANTHA	You're not getting the stomach flip.
IRANDA	Which is just a fear of losing the guy.
CARRIE	Maybe I'm not used to being with someone who doesn't do the seductive withholding dance.
IRANDA	But there is an upside to being with a guy with no surprises.
IRANDA	"Steve is completely predictable, but that's what I love about him."
IRANDA	He's so comfortable and safe.
CARRIE	Are you dating a man or a mini-van?
IRANDA	My new favorite thing to do on a Saturday night is Steve's laundry and I've never been happier.
SAMANTHA	Your relationship is my greatest fear realized.
SAMANTHA	"I understand your dilemma and from my experience, if he seems too good to be true, he probably is."
CHARLOTTE	I don't believe this.
CHARLOTTE	Nowwe're dumping guys for being too available.
CHARLOTTE	This is all solid proof of what I've read in this great new book.
CHARLOTTE	"It says if you really wanna get married, you shouldn't spend so much time around dysfunctional single women."
IRANDA	"""Marriage lncorporated: ""Howto apply successful business strategies to finding a husband""."
SAMANTHA	"Chapter one: ""How To Get Ahead By Giving Head""."
CHARLOTTE	Fine! Make fun.
CHARLOTTE	It's a very smart book.
CHARLOTTE	It encourages professional women to approach finding a mate with the dedication and organization they bring to their careers.
CARRIE	I'm more a student of chaos theory.
CHARLOTTE	"If you don't see as much of me, I'm with my married friends."
IRANDA	And howwill this help you meet your mate?
CHARLOTTE	Bachelor friends of married men are the city's greatest untapped resource.
CHARLOTTE	The way to meet them is through the husbands.
CHARLOTTE	So my first assignment is to befriend the husbands.
CHARLOTTE	It's my new job.
 CARRIE	"That evening, as Charlotte began her new career as a husband-hunter, Miranda returned home to feather her stress-free love nest."
STEVE	I heated up some leftover lasagne.
IRANDA	great.
IRANDA	I'm starving.
STEVE	Wanna get some plates?
IRANDA	What for? It's just us.
CARRIE	An hour later it was on to dessert.
CARRIE	Followed by exactly eight minutes of no-frills sex.
CARRIE	"And 12 minutes of ""Front Line""."
CARRIE	Theirs was the kind of closeness that only came from true intimacy.
CARRIE	Samantha was experiencing intimacy that only came from anonymity.
CARRIE	His name was Dr.
CARRIE	Mark Raskin.
CARRIE	"An ear, nose and throat man that Samantha met actually we're not sure where."
CARRIE	Suffice to say it happened quickly.
ARK RASKIN	"Will you get me some water, please?"
SAMANTHA	What for?
ARK RASKIN	I want to take a hit Of Viagra.
SAMANTHA	Number one that's very presumptuous of you.
SAMANTHA	"And number two from what I can tell, you don't need any help in that area whatsoever."
ARK RASKIN	I don't need it.
ARK RASKIN	I just take it recreationally.
SAMANTHA	What does it do for you?
ARK RASKIN	Sends me on a rocket trip right through your solar system.
SAMANTHA	I'll be right back with that water.
CARRIE	While Samantha enjoyed the thrill of the new and Miranda's relationship happily floated on a placid sea I was searching for hidden icebergs.
CARRIE	Why are you still single?
AIDAN	Why are You Still single?
CARRIE	Don't do that.
CARRIE	I hate it when guys act all cute.
CARRIE	What? -
AIDAN	Waiting for an apology.
CARRIE	OK.
CARRIE	I'm a bitch.
CARRIE	I'm sorry.
CARRIE	You should know I get a tad bitchy from time to time.
CARRIE	I'm sure you have your bad traits.
CARRIE	And they would be?
AIDAN	Alphabetically?
CARRIE	Whatever You got.
CARRIE	"It's all gonna come out eventually, so I'd like to know now and that way I can decide if I'd like to deal with it or not."
"AIDAN
"	This is the strangest two blocks I ever walked.
CARRIE	"Again I'm sorry, but this relationship cannot just sail on like it is: perfect."
CARRIE	"Frankly, I can't take the pressure."
AIDAN	OK.
AIDAN	I'm gonna kiss you now.
CARRIE	Seriously.
CARRIE	What the hell is wrong with you that you're not married?
CARRIE	Tell me.
AIDAN	Can't you relax and go with the flow.
CARRIE	"Go with the flow? No, I can't do that."
CARRIE	It's so seventies.
AIDAN	How long you think this phase is gonna last? My folks are coming this weekend and I want you to meet them.
CARRIE	That's so
AIDAN	Fifties?
CARRIE	That is really nice.
CARRIE	"So, these parents that are coming to town do they know what's wrong with you? Let's get you a doughnut."
AIDAN	Nuts.
CARRIE	"The next evening, taking a page from ""Marriage lncorporated"", Charlotte had dinner with her married friends, Amy and Dennis."
CHARLOTTE	Allow me to get right to the point.
CHARLOTTE	"After careful consideration, I've decided that I'm getting married."
AMY	"Charlotte, that's wonderful!"
DENNIS	Who's the lucky guy?
CHARLOTTE	I don't know yet.
CHARLOTTE	That's where you two come in.
CHARLOTTE	"Dennis, name one great single friend that you have to fix me up with."
DENNIS	I don't know.
DENNIS	No one you'd like offhand.
AMY	What about Phil?
DENNIS	"Phil, Yeah."
DENNIS	If he can tear himself away from his internet company to go on a date.
CHARLOTTE	Yes! Phil.
CHARLOTTE	"Phil, Phil, Phil."
AMY	He is so nice and cute.
DENNIS	You think Phil's cute?
AMY	He's cute.
DENNIS	I can see that.
CHARLOTTE	Great.
CHARLOTTE	Then it's all set up.
CHARLOTTE	I'll call you tomorrowto follow up.
CHARLOTTE	Look! I have tickets to the opera on Saturday night.
CHARLOTTE	I Would like to take Phil.
AMY	great.
CARRIE	"The next morning before work, while sorting Steve's laundry, Miranda came face to face with the true meaning of intimacy."
IRANDA	I was wrong.
IRANDA	There is a point where a couple can get too comfortable.
IRANDA	I reached it this morning washing Steve's underwear.
CARRIE	"Why, what happened?"
IRANDA	"I'm living with ""skid marks"" guy."
IRANDA	I don't get it.
IRANDA	Why do men get skid marks? Is it laziness? Or are they just in a rush?
CARRIE	I don't know but it goes hand in hand with urinating on the seat.
IRANDA	I tell you one thing.
IRANDA	"When your boyfriend is so comfortable he can't be bothered to wipe his ass, that's the end of romance."
CARRIE	It's certainly the end of laundry night.
IRANDA	It got me thinking.
IRANDA	Maybe I mistake falling into a rut with intimacy.
CARRIE	how often are You having sex?
IRANDA	often enough.
IRANDA	But it's totally generic.
IRANDA	We've got every move down pat.
IRANDA	It's more like a race to have an orgasm.
CARRIE	"It's nice to be a contestant, isn't it?"
IRANDA	Sure.
IRANDA	I know what you mean.
IRANDA	"We whine when we don't have a boyfriend, we whine when we do."
CARRIE	Do you remember how Big kept me away from his mother?
IRANDA	I remember.
CARRIE	"And how pissed it used to make me? Now, Aidan's offering both his parents on a silver platter and I'm not sure I want to meet them."
IRANDA	Maybe it's too soon.
IRANDA	I've never met Steve's mother and I'm in no rush.
CARRIE	The irony is Aidan's acting exactly how I wish Big would have behaved.
CARRIE	And I'm behaving just like Big.
IRANDA	Maybe you don't believe it's for real unless somebody plays hard to get.
CARRIE	"When things come too easy, we're suspect."
CARRIE	Do they have to get complicated before we believe they're for real? We're raised to believe that true love never runs smoothly.
CARRIE	There always have to be obstacles in Act Two before you can live happily ever after in Act Three.
CARRIE	"But what happens when the obstacles aren't there? Does that mean there's something missing? Do we need drama to make a relationship work? A few days later, still hearing no word from Dennis about her date Charlotte made a call to his office."
CHARLOTTE	Charlotte Yorke.
CHARLOTTE	He can reach me at home or at work and it's very important because I have tickets to the opera on Saturday.
CHARLOTTE	"Never mind, just have him call me."
CARRIE	"Her call unanswered, Charlotte followed up persistently."
CHARLOTTE	"Can you tell Dennis that Charlotte Yorke called? Yes, he'll knowwhat it's regarding."
CHARLOTTE	"It's regarding my future husband, Phil."
CHARLOTTE	OK? Thank you.
DENNIS	Hi.
DENNIS	You've reached the office of Dennis Fincher.
DENNIS	I'm either out of the office or away from my desk.
DENNIS	Please leave a message at the sound of the tone.
CHARLOTTE	Well.
CHARLOTTE	"Obviously, you have some good reason for keeping Phil and I apart."
CHARLOTTE	I can't imagine what it is but this is Phil's loss and not mine and don't bother returning this call either.
CARRIE	While Charlotte was a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown my anxiety-free relationship was driving me crazy.
CARRIE	Excuse me.
AIDAN	Sorry it's taking so long.
CARRIE	That's all right.
CARRIE	I'm gonna have to pass on dinner.
CARRIE	It's getting so late.
CARRIE	I've got a deadline.
AIDAN	OK.
AIDAN	No problem.
AIDAN	My parents get in tomorrow night.
AIDAN	They'll want to crash.
AIDAN	But I thought you'd meet us for breakfast the next day.
CARRIE	I've been thinking about this meeting your parents.
CARRIE	I just wondered if it's a good idea.
AIDAN	they gonna love you.
CARRIE	"No, I'm not worried about that."
CARRIE	Parents always think I'm adorable.
AIDAN	What's the problem?
CARRIE	Well What if they love me and if we break up you'll always have to explain to them what happened to the adorable girl.
AIDAN	are You breaking up with me?
CARRIE	no.
CARRIE	"Where I come from, meeting the parents Oh, so big!"
AIDAN	You'll meet them some other time.
CARRIE	oK.
CARRIE	"So, I guess we won't be seeing each other this weekend."
AIDAN	I'll miss you.
CARRIE	Maybe that's good.
CARRIE	Maybe we should see each other less then we can miss each other more.
CARRIE	"You're so available to me, and I'm so available to you."
CARRIE	Maybe we're both too available.
AIDAN	"Carrie, it's no big deal."
AIDAN	I have a life.
AIDAN	I'm just making room for you.
CARRIE	You always say the right things.
CARRIE	Goodbye.
AIDAN	Bye.
CARRIE	This is nuts.
CARRIE	I'm sabotaging the best relationship I've ever had.
CHARLOTTE	It's better to have a man waiting for you than the other way around.
CARRIE	I guess.
CHARLOTTE	"And if you hadn't been available, I'd be here alone, just some pathetic dateless freak."
CARRIE	So glad it worked out for you.
CARRIE	who are You calling?
CHARLOTTE	I'm not taking this lying down.
DENNIS	Hi.
DENNIS	You've reached Amy and Dennis.
DENNIS	Leave it at the beep.
CHARLOTTE	"Well, here I am at the opera which I planned on going to with Phil, who I guess you've decided I'm not good enough for."
DENNIS	Charlotte? It's Dennis.
DENNIS	I'm so sorry.
DENNIS	I just got back from a business trip.
DENNIS	My secretary gave me all your messages.
DENNIS	I had no idea you wanted to meet Phil so badly.
CHARLOTTE	"Well, he sounded nice."
CHARLOTTE	It's not a big deal.
DENNIS	"Why don't I set something up tomorrow evening? 7:30? You know Rudy's, Midtown?"
CHARLOTTE	I love That place.
DENNIS	Phil will meet you there.
DENNIS	I guarantee it.
CHARLOTTE	I'm so silly.
CHARLOTTE	I created all that drama in my head for nothing.
CARRIE	What are we seeing again?
CHARLOTTE	"""Aida."""
SAMANTHA	I guess I'm in for another wild ride.
ARK RASKIN	I'd say we both are.
SAMANTHA	What would happen if I tried one of these?
ARK RASKIN	I don't think they've established that it works for women.
SAMANTHA	"There's no harm in trying is there, doctor? Bottoms up!"
CARRIE	Samantha officially became the first woman to land on the moon.
CHARLOTTE	lsn't the opera romantic?
CARRIE	even more So with a man.
CHARLOTTE	"Well, I did expect to be taking Phil."
CARRIE	It's quite a lovely evening you planned for a man you've never even met.
CHARLOTTE	He sounded really nice.
CHARLOTTE	here.
CARRIE	Thanks.
CARRIE	"You knowwhat, honey, I'm not feeling well."
CARRIE	I'm going home.
CHARLOTTE	do You want me to come with you?
CARRIE	"No, I'm fine."
CARRIE	"Stay, enjoy."
CARE	It's all right.
CARRIE	I'll call you.
BIG	I'll be right back.
CARRIE	"I knew it was rude and over-dramatic, but I felt like I'd just seen the phantom of the opera."
CARRIE	"Yes, ditching Charlotte was slightly hysterical, but the idea of sitting across from Big and Natasha through the second act of ""Aida"" was too emotional to bear."
CARRIE	This time I knew what was wrong.
CARRIE	The shock of seeing Big again not only made my stomach flip it sent my spleen leaping right into my throat.
IRANDA	Hello.
CARRIE	It's me.
CARRIE	I'm really sorry.
IRANDA	What's wrong?
CARRIE	I saw big tonight at the opera.
IRANDA	That's why you ditched Charlotte.
CARRIE	she told you.
CARRIE	Was she pissed?
IRANDA	I think she's swearing off women forever.
IRANDA	are You OK?
CARRIE	Yeah.
CARRIE	I'm great actually.
CARRIE	I'm realizing that maybe there is something to this available man thing.
IRANDA	Yeah.
IRANDA	It's kind of nice.
IRANDA	Just separate your whites.
CARRIE	Now I know I wanna be with a man who wants to be with me.
CARRIE	I've had enough relationship drama for one lifetime.
IRANDA	Shouldn't you be telling this to Aidan?
CARRIE	It's 3:00 am.
CARRIE	I'll wait until a more civilized hour.
CARRIE	The next morning I waited until a decent hour to call Aidan and tell him how much I missed him.
RECEPTIONIST	Furniture Company.
CARRIE	"Hi, it's Carrie calling for Aidan."
RECEPTIONIST	He's not here right now.
CARRIE	He's not?
CARRIE	Just Tell Him I called.
RECEPTIONIST	I'll give him the message.
CARRIE	Thanks.
RECEPTIONIST	Bye.
CARRIE	When I hadn't heard from him by that evening I began to get butterflies in my stomach.
AIDAN	"Hey, I'm not in but Pete is."
CARRIE	Hey.
CARRIE	It's Carrie.
CARRIE	Remember me? The girl you wanted to introduce to your parents.
CARRIE	I'm just calling to say hey.
CARRIE	Hey.
CARRIE	I was getting a dreaded feeling that I had played this all wrong.
CARRIE	"Suddenly, the idea of losing Aidan left me short of breath."
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, Miranda was trying not to breathe near Steve's shorts."
IRANDA	What are you doing?
STEVE	I thought you might need some help with the wash.
CARRIE	But there's nothing like a twist in the third act to spice up even the most banal scenario.
CARRIE	"And while Miranda and Steve found new life in the familiar, Charlotte was blindly feeling her way through the unfamiliar."
CHARLOTTE	Excuse me.
CHARLOTTE	Are you Phil? Sorry.
CHARLOTTE	are You Phil?
GUY AT BAR	I Could be.
DENNIS	Hi.
CHARLOTTE	"Well, Hello."
CHARLOTTE	are You here to chaperone?
DENNIS	"Yes, sort of."
CHARLOTTE	What's wrong? You couldn't trust me alone with Phil?
DENNIS	"Charlotte, Phil's not coming I never called Phil."
DENNIS	I didn't want you to meet him.
DENNIS	You'd like him and that could be a problem.
CHARLOTTE	What are You talking about?
DENNIS	"I'm in love with you, Charlotte."
CHARLOTTE	You can't be in love with me you're married to my friend.
DENNIS	"Things haven't been great with us, and I can't stop thinking about you."
CHARLOTTE	this is nuts.
DENNIS	Don't leave.
CHARLOTTE	You kept your single friends away from me so you could cheat? You should be ashamed of yourself.
DENNIS	You're such a spark plug.
DENNIS	I love that.
CHARLOTTE	I'm not interested in starting some married man's car.
DENNIS	Wait.
DENNIS	"Don't leave, please."
DENNIS	"I love you! Charlotte, please."
DENNIS	I love you.
DENNIS	Wait.
CHARLOTTE	Taxi!
TREY	What the hell? are You All right? - are You All right?
CHARLOTTE	"Yeah, Thanks."
TREY	let me help you.
CHARLOTTE	Thanks.
TREY	I'm Trey.
CHARLOTTE	Charlotte.
CARRIE	"And that's how, in the most dramatic fashion, Charlotte met her new leading man."
SAMANTHA	"Well, time to pop one of those baby blues."
ARK RASKIN	Let's go au naturel this time.
SAMANTHA	"No, I really want one."
ARK RASKIN	Don't you think it's good without it?
SAMANTHA	"No, I do not!"
ARK RASKIN	Let's save it for those special times.
SAMANTHA	"Give me my pills, goddammit!"
CARRIE	Mark realized he had brought too much intensity to their relationship.
CARRIE	He wrote Samantha a prescription and she promised never to call him again.
ACHINE	You have no messages.
CARRIE	"After two days of not hearing from Aidan, I realized only a dramatic gesture could salvage things."
AIDAN	You gonna
AIDAN	"Hi, how are you? You're gonna like this."
AIDAN	What's going on?
CARRIE	"You asked me to be here, and I wasn't sure if I could."
CARRIE	"Honestly I mean, meeting the parents is so Then I realized I wanna meet them but I didn't know if you still wanted me to."
CARRIE	"I've called and you haven't called me, so then I thought I'm just gonna go, because being in a relationship means taking a riska leap of faith."
CARRIE	No matter how many times one might have been disappointed before.
CARRIE	I said to myself I'm just gonna show upbecause you're a good man.
CARRIE	A really good man.
CARRIE	Why haven't you called me back?
AIDAN	I was Just trying to be less available.
CARRIE	Really? You don't have to do everything I say.
AIDAN	"Well, you're here now."
AIDAN	Can I introduce you to my parents?.
CARRIE	Won't they think I'm nuts?
AIDAN	Probably
AIDAN	They'll just have to get used to that.
AIDAN	"Come on, Nuts."
CARRIE	"I realized then, that I had made my stomach flip all on my own."
CARRIE	And it felt really nice.
CARRIE	Manhattan is a place you can get anything anytime.
CARRIE	Cabs at 2:00 am.
CARRIE	Chinese food at 3:00.
CARRIE	But you can't get your dry-cleaning.
CARRIE	"Charlotte was spending her time with Trey, a doctor from family money who had it all."
CARRIE	"All, but all of Charlotte."
CARRIE	Apparently Trey was one New Yorker not getting everything anytime.
CHARLOTTE	Trey is so thoughtful.
CHARLOTTE	I wasn't feeling well last night so he took me for some soup on 7th street and then we went to 2nd.
CARRIE	Avenue?
CHARLOTTE	Base.
CARRIE	Then did your physics homework with you?
CHARLOTTE	"No, I wanna take it slow."
CHARLOTTE	He could be the one.
CARRIE	You've only known him for two weeks.
CARRIE	"You can know his e-mail address, but not that he's the one."
CHARLOTTE	I just know.
CHARLOTTE	"And it's really hard, because he's very sexy."
CHARLOTTE	But I don't want to ruin it by having sex too early.
CARRIE	"Oh, so you're everything-but-girl."
CHARLOTTE	I like to think of it as kissing with extras.
CARRIE	Howvery ninth grade of you.
CHARLOTTE	I read that if you don't have sex for a year you can be revirginized.
CARRIE	And probably quite frisky.
CHARLOTTE	But isn't it great? You can erase your sexual past and start again.
CARRIE	Who wants their virginity back? It was bad enough the first time.
CHARLOTTE	How old were you?
CARRIE	Eleventh grade.
CARRIE	Seth Bateman.
CARRIE	His smelly rec room.
CARRIE	"Half a joint, three thrusts, finito."
CARRIE	"And ps, it was on the ping-pong table."
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, I was doing everything plus with Aidan."
CARRIE	I couldn't get out of bed with him.
CARRIE	"My bed was our restaurant, our entertainment, our little New York."
CARRIE	Open 24 hours.
CARRIE	When will they send a search party for us?
AIDAN	I Guess Spring thaw.
CARRIE	"That's an awful long time, my friend."
CARRIE	Downtown another New Yorker was enjoying her full life.
CARRIE	Samantha had a new apartment in the ultra chic Meatpacking District and a new admirer.
LEN SCHNEIDER	"Well, there goes the neighborhood."
LEN SCHNEIDER	"Len Schneider, 4A."
LEN SCHNEIDER	I collect art.
SAMANTHA	"Samantha Jones, 2D."
LEN SCHNEIDER	I Guess You collect compliments.
SAMANTHA	"Oh, Len."
SAMANTHA	Stop.
SAMANTHA	"Really, Len."
SAMANTHA	Stop.
SAMANTHA	If you'll excuse me.
LEN SCHNEIDER	"Listen, I would love to have you come up to my place tonight."
LEN SCHNEIDER	I make a mean wine spritzer.
SAMANTHA	I don't think so.
SAMANTHA	Sorry.
CARRIE	Samantha said sorry but what she really meant was Since when is it acceptable for over-the-hill losers to ask out hot women like her?
LEN SCHNEIDER	I'm keeping you on neighborhood watch.
CARRIE	And just when Samantha thought her day couldn't get any worse
SAMANTHA	This is a catalogue for pre-menopausal women.
IRANDA	"""New Transitions."
IRANDA	""" Nice name."
SAMANTHA	Why don't they call it what it is?
SAMANTHA	J.Crew for women who are drying up.
SAMANTHA	"FYl, I'm not transitioning."
SAMANTHA	I'm happening.
CARRIE	You're on the wrong mailing list.
SAMANTHA	"I shouldn't have signed up for that ""Mirabella"" trial subscription."
IRANDA	I bought a back pillow on line and ended up with catalogues for trusses.
CARRIE	You got a back pillow?
IRANDA	At I'm getting old.com
SAMANTHA	Maybe I could interest you in vaginal lubrication suppositories?
CHARLOTTE	"Listen: ""Ten years before menopause you may have symptoms including: ""all month long PMS, ""fluid retention, insomnia, depression, hot flushes or irregular periods."""
CARRIE	""" But people give up their seats for you on the bus."
CHARLOTTE	"Oh, my God! Vagina weights."
SAMANTHA	My vagina waits for no man.
IRANDA	Look.
IRANDA	The Kegel Master.
CHARLOTTE	What's a kegel muscle?
IRANDA	It helps You sit tight.
CHARLOTTE	and I have one?.
SAMANTHA	You don't do your exercises
CHARLOTTE	What exercises?
SAMANTHA	You have to tighten and release it for ten minutes a day.
SAMANTHA	Kegel exercises I'm doing mine right now.
CARRIE	"Man, she's good."
IRANDA	"Well, I can't wait for menopause."
IRANDA	It will be freeing not to have periods.
CHARLOTTE	I can't wait till flow stops coming to town.
SAMANTHA	No one calls It flow.
IRANDA	my Grandmother did.
CARRIE	No more mind-numbing cramps.
IRANDA	No kidding.
IRANDA	I've got mine right now.
IRANDA	Big time.
CARRIE	"I Hear That, sister."
CHARLOTTE	"my God, I have my period too."
CHARLOTTE	We're all synched up.
CHARLOTTE	I've heard about that happening.
SAMANTHA	What? I'll get mine in a few days.
CARRIE	"If Samantha was running late, I was running even later."
CARRIE	"The ""Gab Magazine"" party was in an hour and my dress was at the cleaners."
CARRIE	"Oh, please, sir! Shit."
CARRIE	Apparently my fabulous party dress would be staying in for the evening.
CARRIE	"Miranda and Steve decided instead of staying in, they'd go out."
IRANDA	"Since when did it become appropriate to bring babies to restaurants? Oh, come on."
STEVE	He's cute.
IRANDA	Yeah.
IRANDA	God invented baby-sitters for a reason.
STEVE	I don't think it's so bad.
STEVE	It's nice to have babies around.
IRANDA	Don't get me wrong.
IRANDA	"I love babies, but not with my soup."
IRANDA	"Oh, my God."
IRANDA	Look at you.
IRANDA	You're a mess!
STEVE	We should do it.
STEVE	Have a baby.
IRANDA	"Yeah, Right."
STEVE	I'm serious.
STEVE	"We'd have a cute baby, not one that looks like Khrushchev."
STEVE	We wouldn't have to get married.
IRANDA	You're serious?
STEVE	Yes.
STEVE	The timing is perfect.
IRANDA	The timing is not perfect.
IRANDA	We've only been living together for two months.
IRANDA	It's way too quick.
IRANDA	We cannot have a baby.
IRANDA	You're insane.
STEVE	Come on.
STEVE	I want a baby.
STEVE	It'd be fun.
IRANDA	It's not like owning a foosball table.
IRANDA	Do you know how much work it is?
STEVE	"Yeah, I know."
STEVE	But I can hang out with him during the day.
STEVE	"Watch ""Sesame Street"" while you're at work, then I go to work at the bar."
IRANDA	"And I'd be up all night with the baby, alone and getting no sleep, then have to get up the next day and work 14 hours to make partner so I can afford the apartment you're watching ""Sesame Street"" in."
STEVE	Let's hope the baby inherits my positive attitude.
IRANDA	Can we please talk about something else?
STEVE	No problem.
CARRIE	While Miranda was left contemplating diapers I was contemplating McQueen versus Gucci.
CARRIE	It's your last chance to attend a fabulous party with a fabulous girl.
AIDAN	It's a party on a boat?
CARRIE	Correction: fancy boat.
CARRIE	"And ps, the fabulous girl is rumored to be easy."
AIDAN	What's the party for?
CARRIE	"This new magazine, ""Gab""."
AIDAN	have You read it?
CARRIE	"No, I want the celebrity sightings."
AIDAN	I'd be stuck on this boat with all these celebs.
CARRIE	And celebrity hangers-on.
AIDAN	"It's tempting, but is it OK if I stay on dry land?"
CARRIE	Of course.
AIDAN	will You Still be easy later?
CARRIE	is That a proposition?
AIDAN	Bon voyage.
CARRIE	Bye.
CARRIE	"The ""Gab"" party was everything they promised and more."
CARRIE	"Regis Philbin, Madonna and ""New Yorker"" ex-editors were there."
CHARLOTTE	"Hey, Thanks."
TREY	"So, where was l?"
CARRIE	"Unfortunately, Trey was doing most of the gabbing."
CHARLOTTE	the part about the birthday present.
TREY	That's right.
TREY	My mother gives me this awful machine for sorting change
CHARLOTTE	He has a lot of change.
TREY	for my birthday.
TREY	I lied to her and said I loved it.
TREY	I jumped into a cab and drove that thing right back.
TREY	"So there I was, on"
CHARLOTTE	40th & Broadway
TREY	"Right, 40th and Broadway"
TREY	I Hear a woman yell like a hyena.
TREY	I almost hit my head on that plastic partition.
TREY	I got out
CHARLOTTE	He told him to stop the meter.
TREY	"And there was Charlotte, lying on the street."
TREY	That's how we met.
CHARLOTTE	And that's how we met.
CARRIE	That's very sweet.
CHARLOTTE	"Oh, and the cabbie got mad."
CARRIE	"It's OK, cos I remember."
TREY	"Anyway, It was fate."
TREY	If my mother didn't give me bad gifts this wonderful gift would never have come into my life.
CARRIE	I'd heard the story at least three times.
CARRIE	Another minute of Trey and we would be in a man overboard situation.
CARRIE	"Hey, I'm gonna go to hit the buffet."
CHARLOTTE	oK.
TREY	Not too hard.
CARRIE	"As I walked away, I realised I hadn't seen Charlotte that happy in years and with a man she had known for five minutes."
CARRIE	And just when I thought I was safe
BIG	Hello.
CARRIE	"Oh, Hi."
CARRIE	Cheese.
CARRIE	Hello.
BIG	I ran into the man I'd been happy with for five minutes.
CARRIE	Right.
CARRIE	"Well, hi."
BIG	I thought I might see You here.
CARRIE	You did?
CARRIE	Where's Natasha?
BIG	she missed the boat.
AN ON BOAT	I'm sorry.
CARRIE	Very crowded.
CARRIE	"Well, I gotta Dominick Dunne is holding my place in the bathroom line."
CARRIE	"Big and l, trapped together on a boat without dates."
CARRIE	We were two miles offshore.
CARRIE	There was no way off.
CARRIE	Children and women with emotional baggage first.
CHARLOTTE	Carrie.
CHARLOTTE	Look what Trey gave me.
CHARLOTTE	Isn't it beautiful?
CARRIE	Wow.
CARRIE	Cartier.
CHARLOTTE	It was a surprise.
CHARLOTTE	He said the last fewweeks have been special.
CHARLOTTE	And that he's smitten.
CHARLOTTE	"Look, it's inscribed."
CARRIE	Let's see.
CARRIE	"""To Charlotte."
CARRIE	It's about time I met you.
CARRIE	""" Sweetie, that's great."
CARRIE	when Does this boat dock?
CHARLOTTE	Around 10:00.
CARRIE	What time is it?
CHARLOTTE	It's not set yet.
CARRIE	It's pretty.
CHARLOTTE	Thanks.
CHARLOTTE	I better get back to Trey.
CHARLOTTE	"I think this is it, Carrie."
CHARLOTTE	I can feel it.
CARRIE	"One woman's ""Titanic"" is another woman's ""Love Boat""."
BIG	Boo.
CARRIE	Jesus.
BIG	So what was that back there?
CARRIE	I I don't know.
BIG	Can't we have a conversation?
CARRIE	I don't know.
CARRIE	Can we?
BIG	Around Brooklyn there's gonna be a mutiny.
BIG	Pass it on.
CARRIE	What a spiffy opener.
BIG	I try.
BIG	So what are you? Are you -
BIG	Are you seeing anyone?
CARRIE	"Yeah, I am."
CARRIE	He's great.
CARRIE	"He's perfect, actually."
BIG	"Where is he, Mr Perfect?"
CARRIE	He's home.
CARRIE	I didn't wanna subject him to the slimy media leeches.
BIG	Good idea.
CARRIE	Present company excluded.
BIG	"That's some outfit, kid."
CARRIE	"Really? Do you think so? If you like this, you'll love the one being held hostage on 74th and Lex."
CARRIE	It's good to see you.
CARRIE	"The next morning I recovered from my see-Big sickness, while downtown, Samantha realised maybe her ship had sailed."
CARRIE	She was five days late.
CARRIE	Later we did brunch and bathroom at Time Cafe.
CHARLOTTE	I'm in love with him.
IRANDA	You're not in love with him.
IRANDA	You're in love with the expensive watch he gave you.
IRANDA	do You have another?
CARRIE	I'm not Tampax central.
CARRIE	Buy them.
CHARLOTTE	I have them at home.
CHARLOTTE	But they won't fit in my Kate Spade purse.
IRANDA	"Wow, Kate must have a tiny vagina."
CHARLOTTE	The watch is a sign that he's in love with me too.
SAMANTHA	He's just in blue ball hell.
CHARLOTTE	Sometimes You Just know.
CHARLOTTE	We're the right match.
CHARLOTTE	It's fate.
IRANDA	It's not fate.
IRANDA	His light is on.
IRANDA	That's all.
CHARLOTTE	What light?
IRANDA	men are like cabs.
IRANDA	"When they're available, their light goes on."
IRANDA	"They wake up one day, decide to settle down, and turn their light on."
IRANDA	The next woman they pick up is the one they'll marry.
IRANDA	It's not fate.
IRANDA	It's dumb luck.
CHARLOTTE	I can't believe that love is random.
IRANDA	You gotta get them when their light's on.
CARRIE	men I meet are flashing yellows.
IRANDA	Or off duty.
IRANDA	They can drive around for years and not be available.
CARRIE	They shouldn't be allowed to get behind the wheel!
IRANDA	Most men don't stay lit long before they take the plunge versus most women who have been lit pretty much since birth.
CARRIE	That was my last tampon.
CARRIE	Are you packing?
SAMANTHA	"No, I don't have a tampon and probably will never need one again."
CARRIE	"A ""no"" is good enough."
SAMANTHA	I haven't had my period in 35 days.
CHARLOTTE	are you?
SAMANTHA	"No, I'm not pregnant."
SAMANTHA	I'm I'm drying up.
CARRIE	come on.
CARRIE	You're overreacting.
CARRIE	It was a stupid catalogue.
SAMANTHA	I'm day-old bread.
SAMANTHA	My time is up.
SAMANTHA	Enjoy your flows.
IRANDA	For someone with no period you've got a mean case of PMS.
SAMANTHA	You have years of miserable cramps ahead of you.
SAMANTHA	Ladies What I'm about to tell you may come as a shock.
SAMANTHA	I'm a little older than you.
CARRIE	That night I couldn't stop thinking about time.
CARRIE	"Was every second of our lives controlled by fate? Or is life a series of random occurrences? If I wasn't always ten minutes late, would my life be totally different? Would I never run into Big? Would there ever be a good time to see him? Was Miranda right? Is timing everything?"
IRANDA	Could you turn that down? I'm working.
IRANDA	"OK, not low enough."
STEVE	You're gonna have to get used to the noise with a baby around.
IRANDA	Look.
IRANDA	I've been thinking about this baby thing.
IRANDA	We're not in a great place right now.
IRANDA	"Can we have this conversation without ""Scooby Doo""?"
STEVE	It's the one where they find the ghost in the salt mine.
IRANDA	I'm serious.
IRANDA	Turn off the cartoons.
STEVE	But What about the ghost?
IRANDA	You knowwhat? Forget it.
STEVE	Miranda.
CARRIE	Then Miranda realised she may have already had a baby in her house.
IRANDA	I wanna shelve this baby thing for a while.
STEVE	"OK, you got it."
IRANDA	Put a coaster under that glass and turn off the lights before you come to bed.
IRANDA	We haven't had sex in over a week and he wants a baby.
IRANDA	What's wrong with this picture?
CARRIE	You can always go the lmmaculate Conception route.
IRANDA	"Seriously, we're in this shitty place."
IRANDA	We fight and I'm working long hours for this partner thing.
IRANDA	And he's using a baby as a Band-Aid for everything that's wrong with us.
CARRIE	What is wrong with You guys?
IRANDA	I don't know.
IRANDA	It's like he's a kid and I end up nagging him all the time.
IRANDA	I'm mean mommy and no one wants to fuck mean mommy.
CARRIE	"Oh, I believe you."
IRANDA	Maybe I'm sabotaging the relationship so I don't have to actually be happy.
IRANDA	Maybe the problem is me.
CARRIE	This baby is gonna need a lot of therapy.
IRANDA	There is no baby!
CARRIE	"oK, mean mommy."
IRANDA	But I do want one eventually and my clock is running out.
IRANDA	I've only got a million viable eggs left.
CARRIE	with those martinis at lunch.
CARRIE	"That night, Samantha got drunk."
CARRIE	She had lost her spirit and no pill in the catalogue could correct that.
CARRIE	And so she accepted a date with Len.
CARRIE	"After all, day-old bread needed to stick together."
LEN	ever been in a Cadillac Eldorado?
SAMANTHA	no.
LEN	"Oh, those babies are smooth."
LEN	They have buttons for everything.
LEN	There's even a button to adjust your lumbar.
LEN	Great for my hip.
LEN	Did I tell you I have an artificial hip?
SAMANTHA	no.
LEN	"Hard to believe, baby?"
CARRIE	Samantha couldn't listen to one more minute of Len
CARRIE	So she slept with him and his hip to shut him up.
LEN	"Yeah, baby."
LEN	Give it to daddy.
LEN	"Oh, Jesus."
SAMANTHA	What.
LEN	"Baby, either you're a virgin or flow just came to town."
SAMANTHA	my period?
LEN	There's blood everywhere.
SAMANTHA	"Oh, my God."
SAMANTHA	That is so
LEN	These sheets are two grand a set.
SAMANTHA	"I'm sorry, really very sorry."
CARRIE	Samantha said sorry.
CARRIE	What she really meant was there are more young studs in this pre-pre-menopausal woman's future.
SAMANTHA	This is embarrassing.
SAMANTHA	I should go.
SAMANTHA	Thanks for dinner.
CARRIE	"The next day, Miranda was putting in time and a half at her firm when"
IRANDA	Miranda Hobbes.
STEVE	Hey.
IRANDA	I'm busy and can't talk.
STEVE	"Meet me in half an hour at 56th and 3rd, OK?"
IRANDA	"I can't, I got a meeting at 4:00."
STEVE	"come on, It will help."
STEVE	please.
IRANDA	oK.
IRANDA	this is not gonna happen.
STEVE	come on.
STEVE	Look at them.
IRANDA	How exactly would this help us?
STEVE	Maybe we're not ready for a baby.
IRANDA	this Could be a test run.
IRANDA	who Would take care Of the test run?
STEVE	Me.
STEVE	"Please, buyer lady."
STEVE	Take me home and love me.
IRANDA	You're insane.
STEVE	Not in front of the puppy! .
CARRIE	Miranda had been backed into a corner
CARRIE	"Even though she was surrounded by bitches, she didn't wanna be one."
IRANDA	OK.
CARRIE	Charlotte and Trey were performing their usual duet.
TREY	and then I got out and found you.
CHARLOTTE	"Oh, really? I found you."
TREY	I think I should come in.
CHARLOTTE	"No, sweetie."
CHARLOTTE	I have an early meeting.
CHARLOTTE	"But thanks, I had a lovely time."
CHARLOTTE	Really.
TREY	Me too.
CHARLOTTE	good night.
TREY	good night.
CHARLOTTE	You're very persistent.
TREY	I Wanna Tell You something.
TREY	"I love You, Charlotte."
CHARLOTTE	You do?
TREY	Yeah.
CHARLOTTE	I love You too.
CARRIE	"That night, Charlotte got everything she wanted."
CARRIE	Trey got a hand job.
CARRIE	And at 3:00 am Miranda was getting nothing but aggravated.
IRANDA	"Please, go to sleep."
IRANDA	"Please, I beg you."
IRANDA	Here.
IRANDA	Look.
IRANDA	This is supposed to be your mom's heart beating orsomething.
IRANDA	are You happy?
STEVE	not Really.
IRANDA	We get this puppy.
IRANDA	I'm the only one taking care of it.
IRANDA	I've been up all night.
IRANDA	You're asleep.
IRANDA	This was a huge mistake.
STEVE	"Come on, relax."
STEVE	It will be fine.
IRANDA	"For you, because you're not doing anything."
STEVE	He's just getting used to us.
STEVE	"Poochie, poochie, puppy boy."
STEVE	Give mommy a kiss.
IRANDA	This is it.
IRANDA	I'm so sick of you being the kid here.
IRANDA	I cannot be in charge all the time.
IRANDA	We're supposed to be equals.
IRANDA	You think we can have a baby? We can't even have a puppy together.
STEVE	We're going through a rough patch.
IRANDA	This isn't a patch.
IRANDA	This is it.
IRANDA	All the time.
IRANDA	And it's not good.
STEVE	Great.
STEVE	"So you're just gonna give up on us, just like that?"
IRANDA	Not just like that.
IRANDA	I have been trying not to give up on us for a long time.
STEVE	That's nice.
IRANDA	I'm just being honest.
CARRIE	Then Miranda realised something.
CARRIE	"All this time, she thought the problem was her."
CARRIE	It wasn't.
CARRIE	It was them.
CARRIE	And there was never a good time to say what she had to say.
IRANDA	"This isn't gonna work, Steve."
STEVE	"There's good stuff, here."
IRANDA	Not enough.
IRANDA	A baby would've been a quick fix for something that can't be fixed.
STEVE	Because you don't want it to work.
IRANDA	That's so unfair.
STEVE	I don't wanna fight you anymore.
IRANDA	do You think I do?
STEVE	I don't know.
IRANDA	Steve I really tried.
CARRIE	"That night, Miranda lost her partner."
CARRIE	"The next day, she got a new one."
CARRIE	Fifteen of them.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, I was still enjoying my one."
CARRIE	Do you wanna have a sleepover?
AIDAN	Let me set the timer.
CARRIE	I didn't know about Aidan but my light was definitely on.
ACHINE	You have one new message.
BIG	"Hey, Carrie, I'm"
CARRIE	I knewwho it was.
CARRIE	I couldn't stop Big coming back into my life.
CARRIE	But I could stop him from coming out of my machine.
AIDAN	"Hey, you're out of filters."
AIDAN	I'm gonna run down to the Korean.
AIDAN	Hey
CARRIE	Yeah?
AIDAN	You make me really happy.
AIDAN	see You in a bit.
CARRIE	oK.
CARRIE	"Oh, that was very fast."
CARRIE	What are You doing here?
BIG	Didn't you get my message?
CARRIE	"No, I paused it."
CARRIE	What are You doing here?
BIG	"That was him, wasn't it? The perfect guy."
CARRIE	"Yes and he's coming back, so Please."
CARRIE	What do you want?
BIG	I don't know.
CARRIE	"No, go home to your wife."
CARRIE	Go.
BIG	I'm so fucked up.
CARRIE	I had no idea what else Big was gonna say.
CARRIE	And I'm not sure what bugged me more.
CARRIE	That I didn't know or that I cared.
BIG	"Hey, Carrie."
BIG	I'm here on your corner.
BIG	I knowyou're home.
BIG	Pick up.
BIG	Jesus.
BIG	"Well, I miss you."
BIG	I can't fucking stop thinking about you.
BIG	There you have it.
CARRIE	There it was.
CARRIE	Exactly what I had needed to hear a year too late.
CARRIE	"I should have been happy, but I wasn't."
CARRIE	It was the absolute worst timing of all.
CARRIE	"Ten minutes later, Aidan still hadn't come back."
CARRIE	Suddenly my life was all about timing.
CARRIE	All the right things said at all the wrong times.
CARRIE	My past coming back way too fast.
CARRIE	And my future taking way too long to come home.
IRANDA	"OK, I gotta go."
IRANDA	Have a good day.
IRANDA	Give me a kiss.
IRANDA	Bye-bye.
CARRIE	"One unfortunate thing about ending a relationship in a city like New York is while you can emotionally move away from each other, you physically can't."
STEVE	Going to work?
IRANDA	"Yeah, work."
IRANDA	Sorry about waking you.
STEVE	What time is it?
IRANDA	6:30.
STEVE	Jesus.
STEVE	Why so early?
IRANDA	"I got a brief due, so"
CARRIE	There was nothing brief about it.
CARRIE	Steve and Miranda had been doing the polite avoid-each-other break-up-dance for three weeks.
STEVE	I'm sorry it's taking me so long to find a place.
STEVE	"I got a lead on one, though."
IRANDA	OK.
STEVE	"Hey, do you"
STEVE	Never mind.
IRANDA	What?.
STEVE	"I was gonna ask if you'd look at it with me, but that's weird, right?"
IRANDA	I don't know
IRANDA	We could do that.
STEVE	Yeah?
CARRIE	"When you find that place to move, you need to fill it with furniture."
CARRIE	That's why smart New Yorkers frequent the opening day of the New Designer showcase.
CARRIE	I'm like your roady.
AIDAN	I don't have a road.
AIDAN	I just have this booth.
AIDAN	"At best, you're my booth-bitch."
CARRIE	"Yeah, I'm your booth-bitch."
CARRIE	I wax your wood.
AIDAN	You wax it real good.
CARRIE	That's because I'm your booth-bitch.
AIDAN	You watch the booth.
AIDAN	I'm going to get us some coffee.
CARRIE	Whatever you say.
CARRIE	I'm your booth-bitch.
AIDAN	That's sexy.
AIDAN	I like it.
CARRIE	I didn't need a blue-ribbon panel to decide he was the finest new designer in the whole place.
CARRIE	"I'd often fantasized about running into my ex and his wife, but in those fantasies I was running into them with a truck."
NATASHA	I don't know howyou could like this clunky wood.
NATASHA	It's oppressive.
BIG	What the fuck?
CARRIE	Hi.
CARRIE	Hi.
CARRIE	I'm working here.
CARRIE	"I mean, I'm not working."
CARRIE	This is my boyfriend's booth.
CARRIE	I'm his booth-bitch.
CARRIE	That's a joke.
CARRIE	Guess it's an in-joke.
BIG	I get it.
CARRIE	So.
CARRIE	Can I showyou something in a hutch?
NATASHA	His pieces are fantastic.
NATASHA	It's just not really our style.
BIG	No.
BIG	We only like teeny-tiny furniture.
CARRIE	This is the designer.
CARRIE	This is Aidan.
BIG	Great stuff.
AIDAN	"Thanks, man."
BIG	Oak?
AIDAN	It's mostly maple.
CARRIE	There we were.
CARRIE	Mostly maple and incredibly uncomfortable.
AIDAN	"Sorry, I didn't get your names."
CARRIE	"Oh, I'm sorry."
CARRIE	These are my friends.
CARRIE	"This is Natasha, and this is Shit."
CARRIE	"Sorry, is that hot?"
BIG	It ain't cold.
CARRIE	here.
NATASHA	"No, I'll We should put cold water on this."
BIG	oK.
NATASHA	It was nice meeting you.
BIG	Thanks for the coffee.
AIDAN	they seem nice.
CARRIE	"Yeah, don't they?"
AIDAN	where do You knowthem from?
CARRIE	from around.
CARRIE	Like 100 years ago.
CARRIE	It's a past life.
CARRIE	"Two hours later, it was time for the opening-day party."
CARRIE	It was lovely.
CARRIE	"Caviar, silent auctions, and landmines."
BIG	Where's Paul Bunyan?
CARRIE	If you're referring to my boyfriend he's doing business.
BIG	"Ooh, he's a big 'un! Where did he learn to whittle like that?"
CARRIE	How many drinks have you had?
BIG	Not nearly enough.
BIG	So How are you?
CARRIE	I'm great.
BIG	"And Daniel Boone, is he a nice guy?"
CARRIE	His name is Aidan.
AIDAN	where is your sense Of humor?
CARRIE	where is your wife?
BIG	Guarding her bid on the silent auction.
BIG	She's got her eye on a beige chair.
BIG	Everything in my apartment is now beige.
BIG	Beige is bullshit.
CARRIE	I thought you wanted beige.
BIG	"Yeah, well It doesn't quite fit."
BIG	have You got a smoke?
CARRIE	I quit.
BIG	We always used to share a cigarette together.
CARRIE	We did a lot of things that were bad for me together.
BIG	I have a secret to tell you.
BIG	It's not working.
BIG	I'm getting out.
BIG	If you know anyone who's interested
CARRIE	You should keep that to yourself.
CARRIE	No one wants that information.
CARRIE	Big's leaving his wife.
IRANDA	No!
CARRIE	he told me at the Furniture show.
IRANDA	What was he doing there?
CARRIE	Drinking and leaving his wife.
CHARLOTTE	"Oh, my god."
SAMANTHA	Let's just say it.
SAMANTHA	You won.
CARRIE	was There a contest?
SAMANTHA	There's always a contest with an ex.
SAMANTHA	"It's called ""Who'll Die Miserable?""."
IRANDA	What did he say?
CARRIE	"He said, ""It's not working out."
CARRIE	""" Then he leaned in and said, ""lf you know anyone who's interested"""
CHARLOTTE	You don't know anyone who is interested.
CHARLOTTE	He's married.
CARRIE	I'm aware of that.
IRANDA	Why is he telling you?
CARRIE	To save postage on his newsletter?
SAMANTHA	What are You gonna do?
CARRIE	Nothing.
CHARLOTTE	She's not gonna do anything.
CARRIE	You're starting to bug me.
SAMANTHA	How dare he say that to you? Married men never leave their wives.
CARRIE	"Even if he did, I have no intention of doing anything for two reasons I have a great boyfriend, and I'm not insane."
CARRIE	Let's order.
CARRIE	What do winners order?
IRANDA	Didn't you feel like punching him? .
CARRIE	No.
CARRIE	It was too sad or something.
IRANDA	I Would have punched him.
CHARLOTTE	"No, It is sad."
CHARLOTTE	How long has he been married? Seven months?
SAMANTHA	The seven-month itch.
IRANDA	That's what happens when people jump into relationships too quickly.
CHARLOTTE	I resent that.
CHARLOTTE	Trey and l are nothing like Big and Natasha.
SAMANTHA	Don't listen to her.
SAMANTHA	She's mid-break-up.
IRANDA	Thanks for the update.
CHARLOTTE	Trey and I really love each other.
CARRIE	Who wants to split a Reuben?
CHARLOTTE	"I'm meeting his mother this week, and if all goes well"
IRANDA	If all goes well what?
CHARLOTTE	Trey is this close to proposing.
CHARLOTTE	I can feel it.
CARRIE	"Oh, my God."
IRANDA	Really? You've just met.
IRANDA	I've had pairs of pantyhose longer.
CHARLOTTE	It's not logical.
CHARLOTTE	This is love.
CHARLOTTE	It's not logical.
CHARLOTTE	"It's right, in my heart."
CHARLOTTE	I feel it's right.
IRANDA	"OK, whatever."
SAMANTHA	"So, how did he look?"
STEVE	Ok.
STEVE	I'll take it.
CARRIE	"As Miranda looked around, she realized the contest was over."
CARRIE	Steve was the ex that was going to die alone and miserable.
IRANDA	You can't live here.
STEVE	It's not that bad.
IRANDA	It's not that bad? It's the doorway to hell.
IRANDA	There's gotta be a better place.
IRANDA	I'll help you look.
CARRIE	Guilt?
IRANDA	Probably.
IRANDA	"I broke up with him, and he's got no money, no savings, no nothing."
CARRIE	There should be a city-funded break-up housing for those in need.
IRANDA	Really?
CARRIE	"A big orphanage where old boyfriends could think about what they did wrong and cry themselves to sleep in a clean, safe environment."
CARRIE	You think you don't really want him to move away?
IRANDA	It's not that simple.
IRANDA	"My head tells me it's time for him to leave, but the idea of him moving into a basement apartment in West Shit Street breaks my heart."
CARRIE	"It's a common belief that women use the left, emotional side of their brain and men the right, more logical side."
CARRIE	"But is it really that cut and dry? When it comes to affairs of the heart, there's a battle between what we know and what we feel."
CARRIE	"What do you do in a situation that leaps back and forth between the left and right side? In relationships, is it smarter to follow your heart or your head?"
BUNNY	This is Trey when he graduated from medical school.
CARRIE	"Later that week, Charlotte met the head and heart of Trey's family his mother, Bunny."
CHARLOTTE	"Trey, you look so cute in a cap and gown!"
TREY	That was before we jumped in the fountain and hell broke loose.
TREY	What's next boy scout snaps?
BUNNY	Count your blessings I didn't bring the one on the bearskin rug.
TREY	You'll have to excuse her.
TREY	She's a bit of a camera nazi.
TREY	"If you insist on dragging us down memory lane, I'm getting a real drink."
TREY	"Excuse me, a Glenlivet rocks, please."
BUNNY	Maybe you should have a red wine instead.
BUNNY	Better for the heart.
TREY	All righty.
TREY	Red wine.
BUNNY	"Thomas, we'd love some more nibbly cheese things."
THOMAS	"Very good, ma'am."
BUNNY	Thank you.
BUNNY	"He's older than water, but never forgets a martini."
BUNNY	do You play tennis?
CHARLOTTE	Mm...hm.
BUNNY	I like her.
TREY	Join the club.
BUNNY	What are You two doing tonight?
TREY	We've got reservations at Cloche.
BUNNY	I was there last week.
BUNNY	Disappointing crab and the host was rude.
BUNNY	Maybe you should go to Cote Basque instead.
TREY	All righty.
CARRIE	Charlotte was impressed with Bunny's technique.
CARRIE	Trey had been looking forward to Cloche all week.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, downtown, Samantha was entertaining Adam Ball, a film editor who made a living cutting coming attractions for film companies."
ADAM BALL	Coming.
ADAM BALL	I'm coming.
ADAM BALL	"Oh, man! You give good head."
SAMANTHA	I'm dating a guy with the funkiest tasting spunk.
IRANDA	And she's never coming back.
SAMANTHA	"Sorry, but who else can I talk to about this?"
CARRIE	"might I suggest, No one?"
SAMANTHA	You're my girlfriends.
SAMANTHA	Help me.
SAMANTHA	have You ever had this problem?
IRANDA	not Really.
IRANDA	But I have to admit it's never been a trip to Baskin-Robins.
SAMANTHA	This guy is very sour.
SAMANTHA	Like asparagus gone bad or something.
CARRIE	Can I cancel my rice pudding?
SAMANTHA	"Beautiful guy, great in bed, it's so disappointing."
SAMANTHA	It's like a bad bottle of Beaujolais Nouveau the first day of season.
IRANDA	It's to do with nutrition.
IRANDA	I once dated a smoker.
IRANDA	It affected how his tasted.
CARRIE	They should put that on the pack to cut back sales.
SAMANTHA	Maybe there's something he could eat to make it sweeter.
CARRIE	You should write to Martha Stewart.
IRANDA	"Dear Martha, funky spunk, help!"
CARRIE	"Dear funky spunk, try a hint of mint."
SAMANTHA	It's not just asparagus.
SAMANTHA	It's asparagus and something else.
SAMANTHA	I know: Clorox.
IRANDA	At least it'll get your whites whiter.
SAMANTHA	this is serious.
SAMANTHA	I almost gagged.
CARRIE	That is serious.
SAMANTHA	What am I gonna do?
IRANDA	Just don't give him head again.
SAMANTHA	I never even thought Of that.
CARRIE	Casual head is back now?
SAMANTHA	It's fine.
SAMANTHA	"He's healthy, and I don't swallow."
CARRIE	As long as you and the center for disease control are fine with it.
SAMANTHA	"He loves getting head, but what man doesn't?"
IRANDA	"If the come-situation were reversed, do you think men would go near it?"
SAMANTHA	Maybe
SAMANTHA	If it tasted like beer.
CARRIE	Miranda came home to something that was even harder to swallow.
ACHINE	You have one new message.
BARBARA	Hi.
BARBARA	If this is Steve's number This is Barbara.
BARBARA	We met last night.
BARBARA	I'm the advertising exec.
BARBARA	"Steve, if this is you, call me."
BARBARA	I'd love to go to a movie sometime.
ACHINE	"Today, 12:22 pm."
CARRIE	And on an answering machine across town
ACHINE	You have one new message.
BIG	"Hi, it's me."
BIG	I need to talk to you about what I said the other day.
BIG	It's important.
BIG	You know my cell number.
CARRIE	The right side of my brain told me to delete it.
CARRIE	But I left it.
BIG	It's important.
BIG	You know my cell number.
CARRIE	"Seven playbacks later, I invited an impartial judge."
CARRIE	Well?
IRANDA	You should have punched him.
CARRIE	"He wants to get back together, right? That's the tone."
CARRIE	"The ""Hi"" and the ""It's important""."
CARRIE	Is that what it means?
IRANDA	We will never know.
IRANDA	They still don't know who killed Kennedy.
CARRIE	What should I do?
IRANDA	It's obvious what you want to do or you wouldn't listen to it and what happened to the sane part of you?
CARRIE	I don't know.After the fifth playback he got in a little.
CARRIE	I hate my machine.
IRANDA	Yeah.
IRANDA	I hate mine too.
IRANDA	Steve got a message from a girl desperate for him to go to a movie.
CARRIE	Already? He's still on your couch.
IRANDA	I know.
IRANDA	It's amazing.
IRANDA	"A 34-year-old guy with no money and no place to live because he's single, he's a catch."
IRANDA	"But a 34-year-old woman with a job and a great home because she's single, is considered tragic."
CARRIE	Depressing.
CARRIE	Let's listen to that message again.
CARRIE	I'm deleting it.
CARRIE	But it wasn't that simple.
CARRIE	"As soon as Miranda left, my emotions overruled both sides of my brain."
BIG	Hello?
CARRIE	It's Carrie.
BIG	"Oh, hey."
BIG	Thanks for calling.
BIG	It's about getting out of my marriage.
CARRIE	"I didn't knowwhy I called or what I wanted, but suddenly my heart was racing."
BIG	"I thought about it, and it's going to cost me a lot."
BIG	You should forget about what I said.
BIG	"I made my bed, I should lie in it."
CARRIE	You do that.
CARRIE	It was what I needed.
CARRIE	A shock treatment to jolt me back to sanity.
AIDAN	You have cracks.
CARRIE	Excuse me?
AIDAN	The ceiling.
AIDAN	How long have they been there?
CARRIE	Just Three years.
AIDAN	"Oh, just three years? Don't take this the wrong way, but this place could use a little work."
CARRIE	I can't afford it.
AIDAN	"You got 8,000 bucks worth of shoes."
CARRIE	I needed those.
AIDAN	"You could do little things plaster, strip the floors You have no idea how beautiful it would be if we took it down a level."
CARRIE	I don't know how to do that stuff.
AIDAN	I do.
AIDAN	let me strip your floors.
CARRIE	lsn't that a lot of work?
AIDAN	No.
AIDAN	It'll just take a day.
AIDAN	You won't know I'm here.
CARRIE	Sure? Really?
AIDAN	A special lady needs a special home.
CARRIE	Here am I with a guy who wanted to make my home better.
AIDAN	Somewhere out there was a guy who wanted to pull it apart.
CARRIE	"It wasn't a left or right-brainer, it was a no-brainer."
ADAM BALL	Tell me why we're here again.
SAMANTHA	I'm making an effort to eat better.
CARRIE	After a browse on the healthysperm.
CRRI	"com web page, Samantha invited Adam Ball to dinner."
WAITER	"OK, here are your wheat grass shots."
WAITER	I'll be right back with the menus.
ADAM BALL	I can't drink that.
SAMANTHA	try it.
SAMANTHA	It's very good for you.
SAMANTHA	Bottoms up.
ADAM BALL	That shit is funky!
CARRIE	Samantha fought the urge not to tell Adam Ball he didn't knowfrom funky.
SAMANTHA	How long does it take for wheat grass to work into your system?
WAITER	Hard to say.
SAMANTHA	Ballpark.
WAITER	An hour and a half.
SAMANTHA	We should order.
CARRIE	"An hour and a half, two wheat grass shots and a ginger-melon smoothie later, I'm coming."
ADAM BALL	I'm coming.
SAMANTHA	"Man, man, man, you give good head."
SAMANTHA	"Oh, babe."
CHARLOTTE	What? You don't like your salad?
TREY	No.
TREY	The dressing's a tadsomething.
TREY	"Excuse me, I'd like to change this for the rucola and endive."
CHARLOTTE	You should try the tomato basil.
CHARLOTTE	It's sweeter.
TREY	All righty.
TREY	Mom was quite taken with you.
CHARLOTTE	she is?
TREY	Why wouldn't she be? You're exquisite.
TREY	You are a dream come true.
CARRIE	"Charlotte knewthis was the moment, that magic moment where Trey was going to ask her to be his wife."
TREY	Charlotte.
CHARLOTTE	Yes?
WAITER	Tomato and basil?
TREY	Yes
WAITER	Enjoy.
TREY	Doesn't this look like a little plate of heaven? This basil is perfection.
TREY	What is it about you Charlotte? You always know just what I want.
CHARLOTTE	Maybe we should get Married.
TREY	All righty.
CHARLOTTE	I'm engaged.
CHARLOTTE	"Oh, my god."
CARRIE	"Really? That's wonderful, sweetie."
CHARLOTTE	I proposed to myself.
CARRIE	what?
CHARLOTTE	"I suggested he have a tomato salad, then I suggested we get married."
CARRIE	What did he say?
CHARLOTTE	"""All righty."
CARRIE	""" ""All righty""?"
CARRIE	"He said, ""All righty""? The upsetting thing is proposing to a guy who says ""all righty""."
CHARLOTTE	Stop.
CARRIE	All righty.
CHARLOTTE	I was the one supposed to say Yes.
CARRIE	who cares about those stupid rules?
CHARLOTTE	I do.
CARRIE	You're overreacting.
CARRIE	"You love Trey, right? And you want to marry him, right?"
CHARLOTTE	"Yes, but there was no kneeling."
CHARLOTTE	"There was no ring, no nothing."
CHARLOTTE	This is an awful engagement story.
CHARLOTTE	"What am I supposed to tell my kids? Mommy really wanted to get married, so Daddy said, ""All righty""."
CHARLOTTE	So unromantic.
IRANDA	Steve? The dog! Steve.
IRANDA	It's 4:00 am.
CARRIE	Miranda realized he was with the girl executive.
CARRIE	It was officially over.
CARRIE	She finally got it into her head.
STEVE	morning.
IRANDA	morning.
IRANDA	I took the dog out already.
STEVE	Thanks.
STEVE	I was
IRANDA	I'll get out of here today.
STEVE	Thanks for letting me sleep on your couch.
IRANDA	You're welcome.
IRANDA	I think we did pretty good.
STEVE	We did us proud.
IRANDA	Steve Never mind.
STEVE	what?
IRANDA	"I was gonna say, ""Keep in touch"", but that would be weird."
STEVE	I guess we could do that.
CARRIE	Aidan.
CARRIE	You said I wouldn't be bothered.
CARRIE	I'm bothered.
AIDAN	It's too loud?
CARRIE	Yeah.
CARRIE	I've got a deadline.
AIDAN	Go to my house.
CARRIE	"No, I can't write there."
CARRIE	Pete's jumping all over me.
CARRIE	He's deleting things.
CARRIE	I'm leaving.
CARRIE	I'll be at the Stanhope Hotel.
AIDAN	at least let me pay for it.
CARRIE	"No, I got it."
CARRIE	This is why I don't do home repairs.
CARRIE	Unforeseen costs.
AIDAN	You'll love these floors.
TREY	Mom was beside herself.
TREY	She demanded your address -so she could send flowers.
CHARLOTTE	That's nice.
TREY	Charlotte had done the impossible in New York.
CARRIE	She was engaged to her heart's desire.
CARRIE	"Unfortunately, she couldn't get the way it happened out of her head."
TREY	Wait.
TREY	I think we should stop here for a minute.
CHARLOTTE	Maybe we should go in and find you the most beautiful ring they have.
CHARLOTTE	All righty.
CARRIE	"From that moment on, Charlotte would tell everyone that in front of Tiffany's, out of nowhere, Trey popped the question."
CHARLOTTE	"And she said, ""All righty""."
SAMANTHA	I'm not really in the mood for that tonight.
ADAM BALL	"Come on, baby, you give the greatest head."
ADAM BALL	Please.
SAMANTHA	It's not gonna happen.
ADAM BALL	Why? What's the problem?
SAMANTHA	"Well, Adam You've got funky tasting spunk."
ADAM BALL	what?
SAMANTHA	You heard me.
SAMANTHA	Your spunk is funky.
ADAM BALL	my spunk?
SAMANTHA	"come, spooge, jiz, joy juice."
ADAM BALL	Funky.
ADAM BALL	"I've heard bad excuses for not giving head, but this one takes the cake."
SAMANTHA	Excuse me?
ADAM BALL	You're a two blow job chick.
ADAM BALL	They're in the coming attractions but I'll never see them in the movie.
SAMANTHA	I resent that.
SAMANTHA	I love giving head.
ADAM BALL	Then give me a little BJ.
ADAM BALL	"Up and down a couple of times, it's easy."
SAMANTHA	You men have no idea what we're dealing with down there.
SAMANTHA	"Teeth placement, jaw stress, suction, and gag reflex, all the while bobbing up and down, moaning and trying to breathe."
SAMANTHA	"Easy? Honey, they don't call it a job for nothin'."
SAMANTHA	"Now, having said all that, with the right man it can be fabulous."
SAMANTHA	"That is, unless the man has spunk that's like the rotten egg buffet."
ADAM BALL	"Come on, it can't be that bad."
SAMANTHA	I'll make a deal with you.
SAMANTHA	You try it.
SAMANTHA	"If you're fine with it, I'll be fine with it."
ADAM BALL	I can't do that.
ADAM BALL	It's gay.
SAMANTHA	"It's not gay, if it's you."
SAMANTHA	Take it or leave it.
CARRIE	"Ten minutes later, Samantha learnt how far men would go for a blow job."
ADAM BALL	I'm fine with it.
SAMANTHA	Samantha kept her word.
CARRIE	"She gave him head, but her heart wasn't in it."
CARRIE	Hello?
BIG	It's me.
BIG	I'm in the lobby.
CARRIE	how did You know I was here?
BIG	That guy at your place
CARRIE	You called my house again?
BIG	I have to talk to you.
CARRIE	I have to talk to You too.
CARRIE	Stay there.
CARRIE	Shit.
CARRIE	this is not the lobby.
BIG	have a drink.
CARRIE	"What are you doing, calling my house, following me to hotels?"
BIG	Could you sit down for one minute and listen to me? Please.
BIG	One minute.
CARRIE	I don't have time.
CARRIE	"I have a boyfriend and a deadline, and you have a wife and a drinking problem."
BIG	I'm not drunk.
CARRIE	then What is your excuse?
BIG	"Slow down, I can't think."
BIG	I was an asshole the other day.
CARRIE	Yes.
BIG	"When I said I was leaving, you didn't say anything."
BIG	"I got nervous, so"
CARRIE	"So, what?"
BIG	I don't know.
CARRIE	"This has to stop flirting, jerking me around, calling my boyfriend."
CARRIE	"He doesn't know about you, and I don't want him to."
BIG	Why?
CARRIE	"Go, lie in your beige bed."
BIG	"Carrie, wait, wait."
BIG	I haven't explained this very well.
BIG	Wait a minute.
BIG	Listen.
BIG	"The thing is, fuck, I miss you."
CARRIE	Too bad.
CARRIE	do not come in here.
BIG	I have to talk to you.
CARRIE	What? What is it you have to say?
BIG	I made a mistake.
CARRIE	Fuck you.
BIG	I love you.
CARRIE	Fuck you.
CARRIE	"My mind was yelling how angry I was, but my heart Fuck me."
CARRIE	And just like that I lost my head.
CARRIE	One ofthe best things about being in a great relationship is feeling comfortable enough to leave it for an evening.
AIDAN	What do you girls do when you get together?
CARRIE	"The usual stuff braid our hair, crank calls, and that weekend stuff."
AIDAN	You don't talk about the boys?
CARRIE	I can't lie.
CARRIE	Sometimes there is talk of the boys.
AIDAN	Men's greatest fear.
CARRIE	I thought It was hair loss.
AIDAN	No problem here.
CARRIE	I can tell.
AIDAN	feel free to Pass That on to the gals.
CARRIE	I'll try to work that into the conversation.
CARRIE	Goodbye.
AIDAN	Bye.
CARRIE	EB White said no one should come to New York unless they're lucky.
CARRIE	I was.
CARRIE	"I had an amazing boyfriend who had all his hair, good friends and a married ex-boyfriend I had slept with a week ago."
CARRIE	"May I just say, ""Wow!"""
SAMANTHA	What can I say? I've arrived!
CARRIE	"Samantha had invited us to celebrate her new apartment, three new clients and her general fabulousness."
CHARLOTTE	Who knew this existed in the meatpacking district.
IRANDA	Just yards away from decaying cows.
SAMANTHA	Homemade baby quiche.
CHARLOTTE	You made these?
SAMANTHA	"No! I had them delivered, along with dinner, the wine and DVD of ""An Affair To Remember"" that we're watching later, drunk."
IRANDA	You can get DVDs delivered?
SAMANTHA	I used this New delivery service.
SAMANTHA	Anything you want they bring within an hour.
CHARLOTTE	Anything?
SAMANTHA	last night I ordered Condoms.
IRANDA	You didn't fuck the delivery guy!
SAMANTHA	"No, John, the hot guy from the gym."
SAMANTHA	The condoms came faster than he did!
CARRIE	There's an ad-slogan.
SAMANTHA	"Ladies, we have it all great apartments, jobs, friends, and sex"
IRANDA	We can have quiche delivered and eat it too.
SAMANTHA	"At my age, my mother had three kids and a drunk husband."
CARRIE	You Just have Three drunk friends.
SAMANTHA	by choice.
CHARLOTTE	Having it all really means having someone special to share it with.
SAMANTHA	Please.
SAMANTHA	That's so barney.
CHARLOTTE	I'm sorry.
CHARLOTTE	My life wasn't complete until I met Trey.
CHARLOTTE	And Trey's mom is so great.
CHARLOTTE	You'll meet her at the engagement party she's throwing for us.
CHARLOTTE	You will love her.
SAMANTHA	Do you see us Manhattan? We have it all.
GUY	Fuck you!
SAMANTHA	You wish.
SAMANTHA	"Carrie, go home."
SAMANTHA	I can take care of this.
CARRIE	"Three hours later, Deborah Kerr had revealed her secret to Cary Grant, and I'd still told no one mine."
CARRIE	I slept with big last week.
SAMANTHA	You're having an affair?
CARRIE	"No, no affair."
CARRIE	"Just one night, and it is not happening again."
CARRIE	Please don't tell the others.
SAMANTHA	oK.
CARRIE	I am awful.
CARRIE	I have this great boyfriend.
CARRIE	I don't know what I was doing.
SAMANTHA	Nothing men haven't been doing for centuries.
SAMANTHA	Was it good?
CARRIE	"It was great, and it's not happening again."
SAMANTHA	Got it.
SAMANTHA	Plates.
CARRIE	How can it feel so good when it's so bad?
SAMANTHA	They design it that way.
CARRIE	Big and l We have this thing.
SAMANTHA	It's all about the pheromones.
SAMANTHA	We're just animals reacting to smells.
CARRIE	"I have a great boyfriend with all his hair, waiting for me, who smells great."
SAMANTHA	"Aidan hasn't said ""l love you"" yet."
SAMANTHA	"Until then, you're a free agent."
CARRIE	the rules according to Samantha?
SAMANTHA	I'm more old-fashioned than you think.
CARRIE	I don't wanna be a free agent.
CARRIE	"Don't you wanna judge me, just a little bit?"
SAMANTHA	Not my style.
AIDAN	Hang on.
AIDAN	Hang on.
CARRIE	Hi.
CARRIE	"God, I missed you."
AIDAN	You gotta go see the girls more often.
AIDAN	Come on.
CARRIE	Suddenly I felt safe again.
CARRIE	It had all just been a bad dream.
CARRIE	"As long as I was near Aidan, it would all be OK."
CARRIE	Until the morning.
CARRIE	Why do you have to go to Pennsylvania today?
AIDAN	See that chair? It's got owners that miss it very much.
CARRIE	Go tomorrow.
CARRIE	"Come on, stay."
CARRIE	I'll make you cookies.
AIDAN	You don't cook.
CARRIE	I'll buy you cookies.
CARRIE	"Come on, stay."
AIDAN	It's just for a couple of days.
AIDAN	You gotta have stuff you wanna do.
CARRIE	What I needed to do was not be alone.
AIDAN	Be good.
CARRIE	"Downtown, Samantha woke up to discover she did have it all."
CARRIE	Including the flu.
SAMANTHA	Shit.
CARRIE	"She never wanted a man around in the morning, until she needed one."
SAMANTHA	John?
SAMANTHA	It's Samantha.
SAMANTHA	Jones.
SAMANTHA	From the gym.
SAMANTHA	"Yeah, right."
SAMANTHA	I wondered if you might be able to drop by on your way to work.
SAMANTHA	"Honey, I can hardly blow my nose, let alone blow you."
SAMANTHA	"Yeah, I wouldn't want you to get sick, either."
CARRIE	"Later, in the bridal registry department at Bergdorf Goodman, Charlotte discovered, she wanted it all, and more."
SALES LADY	Yes.
SALES LADY	We do very well with it.
CHARLOTTE	It's really beautiful.
TREY	Yes.
TREY	It'll look lovely under the noodles we'll have to eat due to my outstanding loans.
TREY	"No, not that face."
TREY	All right.
TREY	If it's what you want.
TREY	I'm too crazy about you to say no.
TREY	I gotta get back to the hospital.
CHARLOTTE	did You do a guest list for the party?
TREY	"Oh, Right."
TREY	I almost forgot.
CARRIE	Sweetie? What's this?
TREY	Prenuptial agreements.
TREY	Standard.
TREY	Everyone in the family has one.
TREY	You sign on page four.
TREY	Feel free to have your lawyer look it over.
TREY	I'll call you later.
IRANDA	This looks normal.
CARRIE	Charlotte wasted no time having a lawyer look it over.
CHARLOTTE	"We're not married yet, and already we're talking about divorce."
CARRIE	A lot of people do prenups.
CHARLOTTE	Marriage is supposed to be about love and happiness.
IRANDA	and the protection Of assets.
CHARLOTTE	That is So unromantic.
IRANDA	And necessary.
IRANDA	50 per cent of marriages end in divorce.
CHARLOTTE	There it is again divorce.
IRANDA	"I'm sure you'll live happily ever after, but I wouldn't marry without this."
CARRIE	I'm safe.
CARRIE	What's he gonna take from me shoes? Maybe I do need one.
CHARLOTTE	What?
IRANDA	This is unusual.
IRANDA	He has you on a vesting schedule.
IRANDA	"For every five years you're married, you get a percentage of $500,000."
CHARLOTTE	"I'm only worth $500,000."
IRANDA	Over 30 years.
CARRIE	Maybe that's your wholesale price.
IRANDA	"If you have any boys, you'll get another 100 grand."
CARRIE	How much for girls?
IRANDA	Nada.
CARRIE	That's bad business.
CHARLOTTE	I can't sign that.
CHARLOTTE	I can't marry someone knowing they feel this way.
IRANDA	This is just their opening offer.
IRANDA	It's standard to negotiate.
CHARLOTTE	I can't even buy stuff on sale.
IRANDA	Talk to Trey.
IRANDA	I'm sure his lawyers will take care of this.
GEORGE	Working over lunch? The New York office is tougher than ours.
IRANDA	"George, this is Carrie and Charlotte."
IRANDA	George works in our Chicago office.
GEORGE	I'm taking depositions and restaurant recommendations from hip and trendy New Yorkers.
CARRIE	You're hip and trendy?
IRANDA	George is from Chicago.
IRANDA	So it's good?
GEORGE	It's fantastic.
GEORGE	I hope the place tomorrow lives up to your standards.
IRANDA	I'm sure it will be great.
GEORGE	I'll drop by your office later.
IRANDA	oK.
GEORGE	"Nice meeting You, ladies."
CARRIE AND CHARLOTTE	Bye.
CARRIE	"Well, well, well, they sure grow 'em cute in the Midwest."
IRANDA	I know.
IRANDA	We have a date.
CHARLOTTE	Find out how much he pays for boys before you get attached.
CARRIE	"and two pages of her black book later, Samantha was no closer to closing her deal."
SAMANTHA	Why don't you go fuck yourself.
SAMANTHA	I won't be doing it againever.
CARRIE	Samantha was discovering it was easier to find a guy to screw her than one who'd screw in her curtain rod.
CARRIE	She wasn't the only one who needed a fix.
CARRIE	I did everything I could to keep busy until Aidan came back.
CARRIE	"I re-arranged my sweaters, defrosted my fridge broke into my emergency hidden stash, and thought about choices."
CARRIE	"Modern women have been told that we can be anything we want an astronaut, the head of an lnternet company, a stay-at-home mom."
CARRIE	There aren't any rules.
CARRIE	Choices are endless.
CARRIE	"And apparently, they can all be delivered to your door."
CARRIE	"Is it possible that we've gotten so spoiled by choices that we've become unable to make one? That we know that once you choose something, one man, one great apartment, one amazing job, another option goes away? Are we a generation who can't choose just one from column 'A'? Did we have too much to handle, or was Samantha right? Can we have it all? Two hours later, I had filed every article I'd ever written, but I couldn't file away what had happened with Big."
CARRIE	I made a choice.
CARRIE	I called him.
BIG	Yeah?
CARRIE	"It's me, Carrie."
BIG	"Jesus, Carrie."
BIG	How are you?
CARRIE	"I'm good, fine."
CARRIE	OK.
CARRIE	We need to talk about what happened.
BIG	Right now?
CARRIE	Yes.
CARRIE	Rationally and right now.
BIG	Apparently you're the boss.
CARRIE	It was Just a physical thing.
CARRIE	"We gave in to our baser instincts, shit happens, blah blah blah."
BIG	are You wearing glasses?
CARRIE	no.
BIG	You sound like You are.
CARRIE	It can't happen.
CARRIE	You're married.
BIG	I'm aware of that.
BIG	"But it was pretty fucking amazing, wasn't it?"
CARRIE	That is so not the point.
CARRIE	We're intelligent beings.
CARRIE	We have to learn to rise above the physical stuff.
BIG	You can learn to do that?
CARRIE	Apparently we couldn't.
BIG	Next time we're going to a hotel.
BIG	I can smell the guy on your sheets.
BIG	Woodchips and Paco Rabanne.
CARRIE	He doesn't wear cologne.
BIG	Maybe he should.
CARRIE	"By the way, there will be no next time."
CARRIE	"This is gonna be like ""The Bridges Of Madison Avenue""."
CARRIE	A brief affair I'll write about to my grandchildren.
BIG	Can I have a beard in the book version? I've always wanted a beard.
CARRIE	Maybe a goatee.
CARRIE	It all felt so easy and so good.
CARRIE	I was like the moth to the old flame.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile that night, Miranda was enjoying her new flame."
GEORGE	Can't believe I have to catch an 1 1 o' clock flight.
IRANDA	But it was fun.
GEORGE	"If I weren't going back to Chicago, I would try to sleep with you now."
IRANDA	I'm drunk enough.
IRANDA	I might have let you.
GEORGE	Damn!
GEORGE	I have to Wait till Next time.
IRANDA	There will be a Next time?
GEORGE	Of course.
GEORGE	I come back and forth a lot.
GEORGE	"In the meantime, there's always the phone."
IRANDA	I have one Of those.
GEORGE	I'll call you tomorrow night.
GEORGE	Damn.
CARRIE	"The next night, Miranda was surprised to hear from George."
GEORGE	I knew you were a middle child.
GEORGE	I love it when I'm right.
IRANDA	"Yeah, spoken like a true only child."
CARRIE	They talked for two hours about everything.
CARRIE	"Favorite foods, families It was one of the best dates Miranda had had."
GEORGE	What are You wearing?
IRANDA	then the date got even better.
IRANDA	Nothing.
GEORGE	wish I were there.
IRANDA	Really?
IRANDA	What would you do?
GEORGE	I would start by kissing your neck
GEORGE	Slowly.
GEORGE	"Then I'd work my way down, start licking your nipples"
GEORGE	Where's your hand?
IRANDA	on your dick.
GEORGE	Put the other one on you.
CARRIE	"That night, Miranda started sleeping with George regularly."
CARRIE	"She had it all her own life, and a great boyfriend she could count on."
CARRIE	"He always called, and she always came to the phone."
CARRIE	"While Miranda came, I was busy preparing for Aidan to come back."
CARRIE	I had slept in Big's and my sex-sheets for two days.
CARRIE	"Like any good junky, I knew how to hide the evidence."
CARRIE	"Hey, you."
AIDAN	come on.
AIDAN	Hi.
AIDAN	Look at you.
CARRIE	I was sure he saw the scarlet 'A' on my chest.
CARRIE	"If Big could smell him, could he smell Big on me?"
AIDAN	I missed you so much.
CARRIE	I should send you to Pennsylvania more often.
AIDAN	You should.
AIDAN	I realized something while I was gone.
CARRIE	"You did, did you?"
AIDAN	Yeah.
AIDAN	"I love you, Carrie."
AIDAN	Is that too much?
AIDAN	-Around Trenton I thought I shouldn't say
CARRIE	no.
CARRIE	I love you too.
CARRIE	"Not only was my secret safe, but I had become lovable."
CARRIE	I felt awful.
CARRIE	And so good.
CARRIE	Wait.
CARRIE	No sheets.
AIDAN	Fuck the sheets.
GEORGE	"You're bent over, and I'm playing with you."
IRANDA	your dick is in my mouth.
GEORGE	"Jesus, I'm gonna come."
CARRIE	"The next night, Miranda was going to third with George when her second line beeped."
IRANDA	"Dammit, hold on."
IRANDA	Hello.
CHARLOTTE	Trey says his mom won't negotiate.
IRANDA	Hold on.
CHARLOTTE	are You OK?
IRANDA	I'll be right back.
IRANDA	Your dick is in my mouth.
IRANDA	Keep it there.
IRANDA	The mom's the one holding the cards.
IRANDA	She's the one to go up against.
CHARLOTTE	how do I do that?
IRANDA	"Charlotte, I'll call you tomorrow."
CHARLOTTE	But
IRANDA	Sorry
GEORGE	So am l.
GEORGE	"You got me so hot, I just came."
IRANDA	You did?
GEORGE	Now we have to take care of you.
CARRIE	"The next night, I went to take care of Samantha."
SAMANTHA	More cough syrup.
CARRIE	Which for Samantha meant making her mom's childhood remedy cough syrup and Fanta orange soda over ice.
CARRIE	"No offence, but this is about to make me sicker than you."
SAMANTHA	Give me my drink.
CARRIE	A frosted martini glass would make that more appetizing.
CARRIE	Why don't you ask the super to fix your window? .
SAMANTHA	I don't have one
SAMANTHA	"I own this place, remember? I should have got married."
SAMANTHA	Then at least I'd have a curtain that closes.
SAMANTHA	"Oh, Carrie, it doesn't matter how much you have."
SAMANTHA	"If you don't have a guy who cares about you, it all means shit."
CARRIE	"sweetie, calm down."
CARRIE	Three days of sleep deprivation had turned Samantha into a new woman Charlotte.
CARRIE	"For someone who had it all, she had never felt more alone."
SAMANTHA	I'm gonna tell you something.
SAMANTHA	"There's two types of guys out there the ones that hold your hand, and the ones that fuck you."
CARRIE	I'd slept with both of them in the last 48 hours.
SAMANTHA	The guys that fuck you aren't worth a damn.
SAMANTHA	We're all alone.
CARRIE	We are not alone.
CARRIE	We have each other.
CARRIE	bed?
SAMANTHA	Yeah.
CARRIE	"Three days of rest later, three healthy girls attended a very uptown party."
IRANDA	Jesus.
IRANDA	Looks like Martha Stewart exploded in here.
CARRIE	"look, headbands are back."
SAMANTHA	Where's the food?
CARRIE	Amazing what days of a cough syrup and Fanta diet will do for the appetite.
IRANDA	They're WASPs.
IRANDA	"There's never food, only booze."
SAMANTHA	Fine.
SAMANTHA	"One martini, six olives."
IRANDA	I can't believe Charlotte wants to be in this world.
IRANDA	Look at these people.
IRANDA	They're like Ken and Barbie cut-outs.
CHARLOTTE	You made it.
TREY	I see You found the bar.
IRANDA	We're good that way.
BUNNY	"Trey, you have to keep people out of the maid's room."
BUNNY	There are photos of me rowing college crew in there.
BUNNY	It's mortifying.
TREY	These are Charlotte's friends.
TREY	"This is my mom, Bunny."
BUNNY	Pleasure to have you.
BUNNY	There's Reverend Williams.
BUNNY	Maybe we should say hello before he gets into the Scotch.
TREY	It's about 20 years too late for that.
CHARLOTTE	I haven't signed the prenup.
CARRIE	What are You gonna do?
CHARLOTTE	I don't know.
CHARLOTTE	I'm confused.
CHARLOTTE	"I love him, but I feel like no one cares about me."
CHARLOTTE	"I thought if we could negotiate, it'd be OK, but now it all feels wrong."
IRANDA	What Does Trey say?
CHARLOTTE	Nothing.
CHARLOTTE	He leaves it to his mother.
SAMANTHA	You can take her.
CHARLOTTE	What should I do?
CARRIE	We can't tell you what to do.
CARRIE	"I wasn't one to talk about marriage, considering I might break one up."
IRANDA	You have to do what feels right to you.
CARRIE	It depends how much you want to marry Trey.
CHARLOTTE	"Bunny, do You have a minute?"
BUNNY	Of course.
CARRIE	"Charlotte realized, if she wanted to close the deal with Trey, she'd have to close the deal with Bunny first."
CHARLOTTE	I haven't signed the prenup.
BUNNY	You've been busy.
CHARLOTTE	I have a little problem with how much I'm worth.
BUNNY	I see.
BUNNY	That is the standard amount.
BUNNY	It's how it's always been done in the MacDougal family.
CHARLOTTE	Right.
CARRIE	"Not only would she have to negotiate, she'd have to play hardball."
CHARLOTTE	"Well, you know we haven't finalized the wedding arrangements."
CHARLOTTE	Trey would be disappointed if I backed out.
CHARLOTTE	"""The Times"" announcement would run, there would be questions"
BUNNY	What do You want?
CHARLOTTE	I'm worth a million.
CHARLOTTE	I did it.
CHARLOTTE	"I negotiated with Bunny, and I signed the prenup."
CARRIE	That's great.
CHARLOTTE	I'm getting married.
"CARRIE, SAMANTHA, MIRANDA"	Congratulations.
CHARLOTTE	I love him.
TREY	"Ladies, May I sweep my bride away?"
IRANDA	She's all yours.
CARRIE	It was then that we realized that we didn't have it all.
CARRIE	We no longer had Charlotte.
CARRIE	"Then, there were three."
SAMANTHA	I can't believe she's marrying that guy.
IRANDA	For a tenth of what she's worth.
CARRIE	I thought you were Ms Pro Marriage now.
SAMANTHA	I was delirious.
SAMANTHA	I also saw spots all over my bathtub.
IRANDA	"I can't believe I'm saying this, but it feels weird without her here."
SAMANTHA	That's such a Charlotte thing to say.
CARRIE	"After a week full of Aidan and no cigarettes, I felt like I had finally kicked my addiction."
AIDAN	Emu.
CARRIE	what?
AIDAN	32 across.
AIDAN	Rare bird emu.
CARRIE	I was getting there.
AIDAN	Not with the wrong word in 15 down.
CARRIE	Then my addiction found me.
CARRIE	Hello.
BIG	I need to see you.
CARRIE	"Miranda, I'll call you back."
BIG	Come down or I'll come up.
CARRIE	"Right, I'll call you later."
CARRIE	I told Aidan I was taking Pete for a walk.
AIDAN	"He believed me, which only made it worse."
CARRIE	Don't ever call me at home again.
CARRIE	Walk.
CARRIE	"You can't just decide you wanna see me, and I'm there."
BIG	is this his dog?
CARRIE	Yes.
CARRIE	"You want it all the girl you screw, and the girl you go home to."
BIG	That's bullshit.
BIG	I just want you.
BIG	"I can't do this any more, sleep with two people at the same time."
BIG	I'll tell her tonight.
CARRIE	What? -
BIG	What?
CARRIE	"No, No!"
CARRIE	"Married men don't just leave their I have a man who loves me, and you have a wife who loves you."
BIG	Don't talk about him and her like it's you and me.
CARRIE	You have no right to do this.
CARRIE	You can't come and fuck up my life.
BIG	I think there were two people doing the fucking here.
CARRIE	Shit.
CARRIE	Pete.
CARRIE	"Oh, shit! -"
BIG	Where are you going? Wait.
CARRIE	"Pete! Pete! Oh, shit."
BIG	Carrie.
CARRIE	Excuse me.
CARRIE	Pete! Shit.
TAXI DRIVER	Watch out!
CARRIE	Pete.
CARRIE	God.
CARRIE	Shit! No.
CARRIE	Go home.
CARRIE	Don't tell anyone.
CARRIE	Don't do anything.
BIG	I Wanna help.
CARRIE	This isn't helping.
CARRIE	Go home.
CARRIE	"Back at Miranda's home, things were heating up as well."
GEORGE	"I unbutton the last button, slip my hand in, and touch your breast."
GEORGE	Your nipple's so hard.
GEORGE	I'll be right back.
GEORGE	"I'm thrusting, I'm thrusting."
GEORGE	I'm deep inside of you.
IRANDA	You were touching my breast.
GEORGE	"Yeah, I'm touching your breast, and I'm thrusting into you."
IRANDA	"No, we hadn't gotten to that yet."
GEORGE	Oh.
IRANDA	Are you having phone sex with other people?
GEORGE	I don't think we ever said this was an exclusive thing.
IRANDA	"Oh, my God."
CARRIE	Miranda stopped being hung up on George.
CARRIE	So she hung up on him.
CARRIE	"Three hours later, I hadn't found Pete, and I felt as lost as he was."
CARRIE	"I had a man who loved me, and a man who wanted to leave his wife for me."
CARRIE	"I should have been on top of the world, but I didn't feel like I had it all."
CARRIE	I felt like nothing.
CARRIE	"I had lost Pete, and I would probably lose Aidan."
CARRIE	I decided to come clean.
AIDAN	"Jesus, I was worried about you."
CARRIE	"Oh, my God."
CARRIE	"Pete's here? Oh, my God, I lost him."
CARRIE	"I lost him and I looked for him and Oh, my Pete, come here."
CARRIE	Come here.
CARRIE	"Oh, God."
CARRIE	I'm an awful girlfriend.
AIDAN	take It easy.
CARRIE	I'm awful.
AIDAN	He's a dog.
AIDAN	He runs away.
AIDAN	He found his way back.
CARRIE	So had l.
AIDAN	I need to ask you something.
CARRIE	oK.
AIDAN	I don't wanna be paranoid.
AIDAN	You took Pete for a walk.
AIDAN	We both know you're not big on the dog-walking.
AIDAN	I can smell something.
AIDAN	Are you cheating? I can smell the smoke on you.
AIDAN	"You're smoking again, aren't you?"
CARRIE	Yeah.
CARRIE	"Yeah, I am."
CARRIE	It was the truth.
AIDAN	are You going to quit?
CARRIE	I really want to.
CARRIE	"That was, too."
AIDAN	Come here.
BIG	Yes?
CARRIE	Room service.
BIG	We've got to stop meeting like this.
CARRIE	You've been waiting your whole life to say that.
CARRIE	I have to be some place in three hours.
BIG	Why is your skin so soft?
CARRIE	"When Dickens wrote, ""lt was the best ""of times, it was the worst of times"", he must have been having an affair with his married ex-boyfriend."
BIG	Yeah?
CARRIE	It's me.
CARRIE	You can't keep changing the time.
CARRIE	I have a schedule too.
BIG	Fine.
BIG	I'm sorry.
BIG	Let's get those panties off.
CARRIE	I have to put my diaphragm in.
BIG	I have to be at work in 40 minutes.
CARRIE	I know.
CARRIE	Our affair like our hotels had gone from elegant with crystal to seedy with plastic cups.
BIG	Cracker? .
CARRIE	"God, it's hot in here, and the windows don't even open"
CARRIE	I hate those sliding air strip things.
CARRIE	I need air.
BIG	You picked the hotel.
CARRIE	"Because it's on 56th and 8th, where nobody knows us."
CARRIE	56th and 8th is safe.
BIG	I don't give a fuck who sees us.
CARRIE	"Yes, you do."
CARRIE	"I do, too."
CARRIE	You want people to get hurt?
BIG	This room smells like take-out curry.
CARRIE	"It's too hot, I can't do this."
BIG	Are you saving it for your boyfriend? Carrie.
CARRIE	No.
CARRIE	You don't talk to me that way.
BIG	I'm sorry.
BIG	I'm sorry.
BIG	Jesus.
CARRIE	How did we get here? Who are we?
IRANDA	Thanks.
CARRIE	I have to tell you something.
CARRIE	You won't like it.
CARRIE	"I'd rather tell anyone but you, but I have to."
IRANDA	OK.
CARRIE	because I need your help.
IRANDA	oK.
CARRIE	I'm having an affair with Big.
IRANDA	I think my heart just stopped.
CARRIE	"Also, I'm smoking again."
CARRIE	I'm smoking and sleeping with Big.
CARRIE	Feel free to delete me out of your Palm Pilot.
IRANDA	Give me one.
CARRIE	Really?
IRANDA	I think I need it.
CARRIE	You are such a good friend.
CARRIE	Don't inhale.
CARRIE	Say you don't hate me.
IRANDA	I don't.
CARRIE	Thank you.
CARRIE	If only I didn't hate me.
IRANDA	how long has It been going on?
CARRIE	Forever.
CARRIE	Actual time three weeks.
CARRIE	"I'm in the middle of this, and I can't see."
CARRIE	I need you to yank me out of it.
CARRIE	Say stuff to yank me out of it.
IRANDA	What about Aidan?
CARRIE	Exactly.
CARRIE	What about Aidan? What about him? I would die if he found out.
CARRIE	Big's acting jealous.
CARRIE	I'm afraid he'll call him or do something stupid.
CARRIE	He's threatened to tell Natasha.
IRANDA	What did You think Would happen?
CARRIE	I didn't think.
CARRIE	I just did.
CARRIE	I'm terrified we've messed it up and it can never be what it was supposed to be.
CARRIE	It's a big mess.
IRANDA	"take It easy, OK?"
CARRIE	I'm confused.
CARRIE	Does he only want me because he can't have me?
IRANDA	Yes.
CARRIE	how do You really feel?
IRANDA	Forget about him. What do you want?
CARRIE	I want everyone to get out of this without getting hurt.
IRANDA	That's realistic.
CARRIE	Why not? You've heard stories about affairs where people realise how great their other relationship is and end it without anyone being the wiser.
IRANDA	"I don't watch ""Lifetime Television For Women""."
IRANDA	You have to just stop.
IRANDA	OK? Just stop.
CARRIE	I am.
CARRIE	I'm stopping.
CARRIE	I am.
IRANDA	Good.
IRANDA	who else knows about this?
CARRIE	Samantha.
CARRIE	and god.
IRANDA	not Charlotte?
CARRIE	"If the-world-according-to-bride knew, she'd kill me."
IRANDA	At least you wouldn't have to be a bridesmaid.
CARRIE	"While Miranda was trying not to judge me on the Upper East Side, Samantha was judging the crowd at a hot spot on the Lower West Side."
CARRIE	"It was a typical mix ten per cent Wall Street, ten per cent real estate, ten per cent she'd slept with."
CARRIE	His name was Tom Reymi.
TOM REYMI	Excuse me.
CARRIE	"A Manhattan legend straight, single, and sexually very active."
CARRIE	The male Samantha.
TOM REYMI	Hi.
TOM REYMI	I'm Tom Reymi.
SAMANTHA	I know who You are.
SAMANTHA	I'm
TOM REYMI	I knowwho You are.
SAMANTHA	It's about time we met.
TOM REYMI	"We knowthe same people, we should go to dinner, blah blah."
TOM REYMI	Wanna fuck?
SAMANTHA	Under a minute.
SAMANTHA	You Could qualify for the Olympics.
"SAMANTHA, TOM REYMI"	my place is
TOM REYMI	Do you swing? .
SAMANTHA	swing? You mean with other couples?
TOM REYMI	No. Swing.
SAMANTHA	"Oh my, so Cirque du Soleil."
TOM REYMI	You haven't fucked till you've fucked in the swing.
SAMANTHA	I've always wanted to run off and join the circus.
TOM REYMI	"So, Samantha when was your last AlDS test?"
SAMANTHA	So much for foreplay.
TOM REYMI	"Anyone who has as much sex as us has to ask, right? I was tested again three weeks ago."
TOM REYMI	I'm good to go.
TOM REYMI	How about you?
CARRIE	Samantha didn't know howto tell Tom Reymi that the only sex test she'd ever taken was the Cosmo Quiz.
TOM REYMI	"You have been tested, right?"
SAMANTHA	"No, but I'm very healthy."
TOM REYMI	You haven't been tested.
TOM REYMI	Why?
SAMANTHA	I'm a busy girl.
TOM REYMI	I got hard in that club just from looking at you.
TOM REYMI	We both know what's gonna happen when we get in that swing.
TOM REYMI	"I can't fuck you or eat you how I want, unless I know it's safe."
TOM REYMI	"Samantha, you should do me."
TOM REYMI	I am as good as they say.
CARRIE	Samantha had to figure out just how much she wanted to do Reymi.
CHARLOTTE	The pink Post-its are for the gowns I kinda like.
CHARLOTTE	Green is for the gowns I kinda really like.
CHARLOTTE	Yellow is for the gowns I don't know if I like.
IRANDA	"Kill me, please."
IRANDA	Drag a sharp object across my throat.
CHARLOTTE	Stop.
CHARLOTTE	"You take ""Modern Bride""."
CHARLOTTE	"Samantha, ""New York Bride""."
CARRIE	"And I'll take ""Annoying Bride""?"
CHARLOTTE	Page 21 1.
CHARLOTTE	Tell me what you think.
CARRIE	Okey...dokey.
IRANDA	Cute purse.
CHARLOTTE	There's no time for purses.
CHARLOTTE	This is gown specific.
IRANDA	is your theme a Nazi wedding?
CHARLOTTE	Page 21 1.
CARRIE	It's pretty.
CARRIE	I like the flowers.
CHARLOTTE	"me, too."
CHARLOTTE	And I like that satin bow.
SAMANTHA	Have you all had an AlDS test?
CARRIE	Good morning.
CARRIE	Where did that come from?
SAMANTHA	I met this very hot guy.
SAMANTHA	He won't sleep with me unless I have a test.
CHARLOTTE	We're looking at wedding gowns.
CHARLOTTE	Could you not talk about AlDS now?
CARRIE	You've never had an HlV test?
SAMANTHA	No.
SAMANTHA	Have you?
CARRIE	Two.
IRANDA	Three.
CHARLOTTE	how about upper length gloves?
IRANDA	how can You not have had a test?
CARRIE	She doesn't mean that the way it sounds.
CARRIE	It's just
CARRIE	Why not?
SAMANTHA	I always practise safe sex.
SAMANTHA	"All right, I'm terrified."
SAMANTHA	What if I have it?
CARRIE	You don't have it.
SAMANTHA	Sometimes it takes me a long time to get over a cold.
CARRIE	That's air conditioning.
CARRIE	Just get it over with.
CARRIE	The test is nothing.
CARRIE	The worst part is waiting for the results.
IRANDA	"They take some people to this room, and you knowthe news ain't good."
IRANDA	"I sat there praying, ""Please don't take me in that room""."
CHARLOTTE	There are 1400 gowns in this magazine.
CHARLOTTE	I have only seen 600 of them.
CHARLOTTE	I need help.
SAMANTHA	You need to chill out.
SAMANTHA	Hire a stylist.
CHARLOTTE	a stylist?
SAMANTHA	Some minion to do your dress bidding.
CHARLOTTE	I can hire someone to do that?
SAMANTHA	This is New York.
SAMANTHA	You can hire someone to do anything.
SAMANTHA	I'll fax you some names.
CHARLOTTE	"Thank You, Thank you."
SAMANTHA	If only I could hire someone to take that test.
CARRIE	"Later, I got thinking about safe sex."
CARRIE	"Odd how only when our physical life is at risk, do we protect ourselves."
CARRIE	"What about our emotional lives? Wouldn't it be nice if there was a pamphlet to warn us what behaviour might be high risk to ourselves or our relationships? Even if you take precautions and emotionally try to protect yourself, when you crawl in bed with someone, is sex ever safe?"
IRANDA	"Yeah, I know, but that's not my problem."
CARRIE	"The next day, Miranda experienced a different type of high risk behaviour."
SANDWICH	eat me.
IRANDA	Excuse me?
SANDWICH	Eat me.
CARRIE	Miranda was furious.
CARRIE	"It was bad enough she had just lost a case, but now she was being harassed by a sandwich."
ANTHONY	"You want pasta, you go to Little ltaly."
ANTHONY	"You want wedding, you go Wang."
CARRIE	"You want the perfect wedding dress, go to Anthony, stylist."
ANTHONY	"Where is that sales girl? For these prices, we should be pulling her nose out of our asses."
ANTHONY	"Hello, someone."
ANTHONY	Let's go.
CARRIE	Charlotte was thrilled.
CARRIE	Anthony was like the pushy mother she never had.
ANTHONY	"Go, go, go"
CHARLOTTE	I love them all.
ANTHONY	Duchess satin with the lace applique.
CHARLOTTE	the white is Too white.
SALESWOMAN	"No, with your skin tone"
ANTHONY	Hates it. Move on.
ANTHONY	"The sharmoose, strapless, with the net overlay."
ANTHONY	Hates it.
ANTHONY	"Good bead work, though."
ANTHONY	None of these are right at all.
ANTHONY	You're dragging!
CHARLOTTE	I hope she doesn't think I'm a bitch.
ANTHONY	"She's not paid to think, but to make you happy."
CHARLOTTE	I've been imagining my wedding dress ever since I was a little girl.
CHARLOTTE	I want it to be perfect.
ANTHONY	Not for nothing.
ANTHONY	I've done this a million times.
ANTHONY	Don't worry.
ANTHONY	You'll know the right dress when you see it.
CHARLOTTE	Anthony.
ANTHONY	Char.
CHARLOTTE	That's it.
CARRIE	"Across town, Samantha felt as though she might cry as well."
NURSE	have You had an HlV test before?
SAMANTHA	no.
NURSE	Why are you taking this test?
SAMANTHA	"Ifeel You know, it's"
NURSE	Are you feeling all right?
SAMANTHA	"Sorry, I'm really nervous."

SAMANTHA	Yes.
NURSE	How many sexual partners have you had?
SAMANTHA	I'm counting.
SAMANTHA	This year?
CARRIE	"While Samantha tried to remember her sexual past, I came face to face with my sexual present."
CARRIE	stop.
AIDAN	Stop what?
CARRIE	You're making that sound. That kissing sound.
CARRIE	It's annoying.
AIDAN	"It's just a sound I make, I guess."
AIDAN	Come here.
AIDAN	I'll try not to do it anymore.
AIDAN	"Look, Ma, no sound."
CARRIE	I can't breathe.
CARRIE	I can't breathe.
CARRIE	I'm sorry.
CARRIE	I'm sorry.
AIDAN	Don't go.
AIDAN	I don't get it.
AIDAN	You used to like that sound I make.
AIDAN	I love that sound.
CARRIE	where are You going?
AIDAN	home.
AIDAN	I need time.
CARRIE	"I'm in a weird place right now, but I'll be out of it soon."
CARRIE	I promise.
CARRIE	I'm sorry.
CARRIE	Say it's OK.
AIDAN	It's OK.
AIDAN	What can I do?
CARRIE	"Nothing, it's me."
CARRIE	It's all me.
CARRIE	I Just need time to figure It out.
AIDAN	I'll give you room to do that.
CARRIE	"You're not saying that in a bad way, right?"
AIDAN	No. I'll be right downtown.
CARRIE	"Hey, buddy."
CARRIE	Call me later?
AIDAN	It's 1 :00 in the morning.
AIDAN	I'll call you tomorrow.
CARRIE	Make the noise.
CARRIE	Please make the noise.
AIDAN	Good night.
CARRIE	Sorry.
CARRIE	"I didn't know what I was doing, but I was sure I had just entered high-risk relationship behaviour."
SANDWICH	Eat me.
CARRIE	"Three days later, Miranda had got her fill of the sandwich."
IRANDA	That's it.
IRANDA	You're not allowed to harass women like that.
SANDWICH	Eat me.
IRANDA	We'll see about that.
IRANDA	I'd like to speak to the manager.
ANAGER	That's me.
IRANDA	That sandwich says sexually explicit things to women as they walk by.
ANAGER	What did he say?
IRANDA	"""Eat me."""
ANAGER	"Yeah, he's a sandwich."
IRANDA	He didn't say it in the sandwich way.
IRANDA	He said it in the sexual harassing way.
ANAGER	He's a sandwich.
SANDWICH	eat me.
IRANDA	You're brave inside your sandwich.
CARRIE	Then Miranda glimpsed just enough of his full lips and shiny white teeth to stop thinking about the sandwich and start wondering about the man inside.
IRANDA	I can't stop thinking about him.
CARRIE	You're turned on by a sandwich?
IRANDA	It's the fact that I can't see him.
IRANDA	It's dangerous or something.
CARRIE	That is one Fresh sandwich.
IRANDA	his voice is So sexy.
IRANDA	He's probably a troll.
IRANDA	Any man who propositions a woman from a sandwich must be a troll.
CARRIE	I don't know.
CARRIE	You think he's white meat? That's the first laugh I've had in weeks.
CARRIE	Thank the sandwich when you have sex.
IRANDA	I can't have sex with a sandwich.
IRANDA	Can l?
CARRIE	"I never thought I'd have sex with a married ex. Can a hoagy be that far behind? Miranda, what the hell am I gonna do?"
CARRIE	"As Samantha waited for her results, she had one thought over and over."
CARRIE	"""Don't let them take me into that little room."
NURSE	""" Ms Jones, I've got your results."
NURSE	Please come with me.
CARRIE	Samantha began to realise she was being taken into that little room.
CARRIE	She was healthy.
CARRIE	The nurse just wanted a quiet place to lecture her on safe sex practises.
CARRIE	"Days later, somehow I found myself back at the corner of 56th and Safeth."
JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN	how much?
CARRIE	Excuse me?
JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN	I've seen you here before.
JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN	For sex how much?
CARRIE	I'm out of here.
CARRIE	That Japanese businessman thinks I'm a hooker.
BIG	Wait.
BIG	Carrie!
CHARLOTTE	Carrie? What are you doing in this neighbourhood?
BIG	"Carrie, can we Hey."
BIG	I was doing business in the area.
BIG	We bumped into each other.
BIG	How are you?
CHARLOTTE	"I just checked on my wedding dress, it's at the tailor and"
CARRIE	Charlotte
CHARLOTTE	I'd better go.
CARRIE	Charlotte.
CARRIE	That was that.
CARRIE	Now nowhere was safe.
CARRIE	Not even 56th and 8th.
CARRIE	"It was a force bigger than me, like Niagara Falls, you know?"
CHARLOTTE	"No, I don't know. He's married."
CARRIE	I know he's married.
CHARLOTTE	You're the other woman.
CARRIE	I'm not the other woman.
CARRIE	I'm not.
CARRIE	"I mean I know I am, but I am not that woman."
CARRIE	"Please, I feel bad enough already."
CHARLOTTE	Good.
CHARLOTTE	Do you ever think about how she'd feel if she found out?
CARRIE	I think about It All the time.
CHARLOTTE	"No, you don't."
CHARLOTTE	"You think about what would happen to you, not about her."
CHARLOTTE	She's just the idiot wife.
CHARLOTTE	You don't know anything about her.
CARRIE	I'll suffocate myself in this.
CHARLOTTE	This isn't a joke.
CHARLOTTE	They took vows.
CHARLOTTE	Vows he broke.
CHARLOTTE	I'm getting married.
CHARLOTTE	Howwould you feel if someone did this to me?
CARRIE	I would kill them.
CHARLOTTE	How could you do this? You're my maid of honour.
CARRIE	I'm getting out.
CARRIE	"Can I please help you pack now? So we stood and bubble-wrapped, the bride to be and her maid of dishonour."
CARRIE	A week of fantasising sex with the sandwich man had gotten to Miranda.
CARRIE	"Safe or not, she needed to see who she was dealing with."
IRANDA	Hi.
IRANDA	"Look, this is so silly."
SANDWICH	Eat me.
IRANDA	Let me see your face.
CARRIE	"Even though he was cute, Miranda walked away."
CARRIE	What did they have in common? She was a lawyer.
CARRIE	He was a sandwich.
CARRIE	"Later, at Tom Reymi's, after a week of sheer anxiety, Samantha enjoyed the benefits of totally safe sex."
BIG	Take your time.
BIG	There's stuff in the kitchen if you're hungry
CARRIE	It was the lowest of the low.
CARRIE	"I had made love to my married ex-boyfriend on his lunch hour at his apartment, while his 25-year-old wife was sunning herself at the Hamptons."
CARRIE	Jesus.
BIG	what?
CARRIE	Could I feel any more like a hooker?
BIG	Why do you keep doing that to yourself?
CARRIE	We should stop seeing each other.
BIG	Why?
CARRIE	You're married.
BIG	Hand me the phone.
BIG	I'm gonna call her right now.
CARRIE	Don't be ridiculous.
CARRIE	What are you gonna do call her at the beach and say you love me and want a divorce? You don't want me to call her because you love that other guy.
BIG	this is about That other guy.
CARRIE	he has a name.
CARRIE	It's Aidan.
CARRIE	"You have a wife, Natasha."
BIG	Give me the phone.
CARRIE	You could have told her by now.
BIG	You told me not to tell her.
CARRIE	Here.
CARRIE	Call her.
BIG	"If I make that call, are you gonna be there for me?"
CARRIE	"Are we gonna do this, really? I mean, out in the daylight, no cocktails, no hotel rooms, real life?"
BIG	"Carrie, in or out?"
CARRIE	I need more time.
BIG	I'm calling her Monday.
BIG	I have to go.
BIG	You know howto let yourself out.
CARRIE	I couldn't help but wonder if I really did knowthe way to let myself out.
CARRIE	Charlotte was right.
CARRIE	What did l really know about Natasha? Natasha is a woman who likes tea roses.
CARRIE	Natasha collects antique sugar bowls.
NATASHA	Honey?
CARRIE	Natasha comes home from the Hamptons early.
NATASHA	"Honey, are you here? I took the Jitney home."
NATASHA	Sweetheart? Honey? Carrie.
NATASHA	I see you.
NATASHA	"Wait! I knew you were having an affair, but not in my house."
NATASHA	"Stop, I'm talking to you."
CARRIE	"Oh my God! I had assumed, the one who would be hurt would be me."
CARRIE	Taxi! Nearest hospital.
BIG	Is she all right?
CARRIE	She lost a tooth and needed a stitch in her lip.
CARRIE	"They had a plastic surgeon, and it won't scar."
CARRIE	She's scared and swollen.
CARRIE	Her parents are on the way.
CARRIE	I have to go.
BIG	Thanks for being here.
BIG	I'll call you.
CARRIE	For what? We're so over.
CARRIE	"We need a newword for ""over""."
BIG	Carrie.
AIDAN	Surprise.
AIDAN	Where have you been all day?
CARRIE	I went to a museum. Just walking around.
AIDAN	"Oh, Yeah? Howwas it?"
CARRIE	It was Good.
CARRIE	I'll just wash my face.
CARRIE	I'll be right in.
AIDAN	oK.
CARRIE	"Somehow, I had found a way to let myself out of the mess."
CARRIE	I'd made it home.
CARRIE	"For Miranda, the only thing worse than being Charlotte's 34-year-old bridesmaid was being a 34-year-old bridesmaid without a date."
CARRIE	"With the wedding approaching, Miranda fell prey to the siren song of a singles event."
CARRIE	Multi-dating.
CARRIE	"$20 bought you seven mini-dates, each eight minutes long which is as long as blind dates should be."
IRANDA	Hi.
IRANDA	I'm Miranda Hobbes.

IRANDA	They don't want a lawyer.
CARRIE	They
AIDAN	want a liar.
CARRIE	I was the liar.
CARRIE	"I'd finally ended my affair with Big, but the guilt of lying to Aidan was like a hangover I couldn't sleep off."
IRANDA	"I'm just saying, as a lawyer a partner, no less I got zero dates."
IRANDA	"As a stewardess, I got one for tomorrow."
CARRIE	"The correct term is ""flight attendant""."
IRANDA	not if You Wanna get laid.

SAMANTHA	"For example, ""I'm in PR""."
SAMANTHA	"Translation ""l give great head""."
AIDAN	What? -
IRANDA	He's actually an OK guy.
IRANDA	"Harris Bragan, emergency room doctor."
AIDAN	"Yeah, but you can't date the guy now because you lied."
IRANDA	I'd tell him eventually.
IRANDA	If he got upset he'd look completely shallow.
CARRIE	And it would make you look schizo.
TREY	Excuse me.
TREY	"I We See, mother, I told you I'd become a ""we"" sooner or later."
TREY	"This is a ""wee"" toast."

TREY	"Let's eat, drink, and be married."
IRANDA	She's so happy.
SAMANTHA	She doesn't have to be a bridesmaid.
CARRIE	We got off easy.
CARRIE	The groomsmen have to wear kilts.
SAMANTHA	I like the idea of men in skirts easy access.
IRANDA	Is it true that they wear nothing underneath?
SAMANTHA	I'll find out and get back to you.
SAMANTHA	"His name was Caleb, right? Hi there."
SAMANTHA	I'm Samantha Jones.
CALEB 	"Caleb MacDougal, Samantha."
CALEB	Pleasure.
SAMANTHA	first time in New York City?.
CALEB	"Aye, and it's brilliant, like"
CALEB	"The architecture, the energy."
CALEB	"It is, you know."
CARRIE	Samantha could barely understand him.
CARRIE	"But if his tongue could do that, she wondered what it could do to her."
SAMANTHA	I'd be happy to showyou around town.
CALEB	That would be great.
CALEB	"Trey got lost bringing me back from the Stanhope Hotel, like."
CARRIE	Samantha wasn't the only one feeling lost.
CARRIE	I'm thinking I have to tell him.
IRANDA	Tell Who?
CARRIE	Aidan.
CARRIE	I might have to tell him about Big.
SAMANTHA	Why Would You do that?
CARRIE	I don't know.
CARRIE	Relationships are supposed to be built on trust.
SAMANTHA	"No offence, but that ship has sailed."
CHARLOTTE	You're right.
CHARLOTTE	"You have to tell him, but not before the wedding."
CHARLOTTE	It's my week.
IRANDA	It's your day.
IRANDA	"You get a day, not a week."
SAMANTHA	There's no reason to tell him.
SAMANTHA	Men lie about this all the time.
IRANDA	and Women find out.
CARRIE	What if he finds out?
SAMANTHA	You fucked Big all over Manhattan. Why should he find out now?
CHARLOTTE	Could you not use the f-word in Vera Wang?
IRANDA	"If my boyfriend was sleeping with somebody else for three weeks, I'd wanna know about it."
IRANDA	I'd wanna have all the information.
CARRIE	That might mean more coming from someone not posing as a stewardess.
CHARLOTTE	What?
CARRIE	"Nothing, but at your wedding we have to pretend Miranda's a stewardess."
CHARLOTTE	I don't wanna pretend anything.
CHARLOTTE	And I don't want you and Aidan fighting.
SAMANTHA	Don't you think this could be a little shorter?
CHARLOTTE	the skirts must the same length.
SAMANTHA	Really?
SAMANTHA	What about Trey's skirt?
CHARLOTTE	"It's a kilt, and it's tradition."
CHARLOTTE	Can't I ask you not to wear your dress round your see-you-next-Tuesday?
SAMANTHA	My what?
CHARLOTTE	C-U-Next
CARRIE	"Tuesday? Oh, my god."
CARRIE	Was that a Schoolhouse Rock I missed?
SAMANTHA	"If I have to be a bridesmaid, I'd at least like to look good."
CHARLOTTE	You don't have to be a bridesmaid.
SAMANTHA	then Why am I here?
CHARLOTTE	"Frankly, I didn't want you to feel left out."
SAMANTHA	I would love to be left out.
SAMANTHA	I could be in bed with a hot Scot right now.
CHARLOTTE	Fine.
CARRIE	Don't do this.
CHARLOTTE	What? We're just being honest.
SAMANTHA	"Honestly, I hate this color."
CARRIE	I started thinking about honesty.
CARRIE	Maybe the idea was overrated.
CARRIE	"Maybe coming clean is the ultimate selfish act, a way to absolve yourself by hurting someone who doesn't deserve to be hurt."
CARRIE	I cheated on a test in the fifth grade with two friends.
CARRIE	They confessed and failed the class.
CARRIE	"I never told anyone, and it never mattered."
CARRIE	"In a relationship, is honesty really the best policy? Evidently, dishonesty was the best policy for Miranda."
CARRIE	"As a stewardess, she was a charming date."
IRANDA	"Once you work first class, you can't go back to coach."
HARRIS	I imagine.
IRANDA	"Oh, Yeah."
IRANDA	No warm cookies in coach.
HARRIS	You get to eat the cookies?
IRANDA	There's always some actress who doesn't want her cookie.
HARRIS	"Free travel, cookies this sounds like a great job."
IRANDA	You've got the great job a New York ER.
IRANDA	I'm not saving lives.
HARRIS	"You are, in the event of an emergency."
IRANDA	Inflatable slide I'm in charge of that.
IRANDA	"But once we open the slide, it's every man for himself."
CARRIE	"That night, Harris got to make love to a stewardess."
CARRIE	Miranda didn't have to fake anything.
IRANDA	Wow.
HARRIS	"Yeah, Wow."
IRANDA	"I'd love to ask you to spend the night, but I've got an early flight to DC."
IRANDA	The 5:00am-er.
HARRIS	I should get some rest too.
HARRIS	Saturdays at the hospital are non-stop since roller blades were invented.
HARRIS	do You have a boy in every port?
IRANDA	every airport.
HARRIS	Seriously.
HARRIS	I bet you're a heartbreaker.
IRANDA	"In truth, it's a lonely life."
IRANDA	There's a wedding I'm in on Sunday.
CARRIE	"Days later, the four of us celebrated Charlotte's last night as a single woman."
IRANDA	I can't believe you're getting married.
IRANDA	Is this the beginning? Are you next?
CARRIE	"Oh, yeah. I'm headed for a storybook ending."
CARRIE	"The little girl had an affair, lied to her boyfriend, and lived happily ever after."
SAMANTHA	"Marriage doesn't guarantee a happy ending, just an ending."
CHARLOTTE	the end Of dating.
CARRIE	All Right then.
SAMANTHA	It's also the end of the possibility that your next great fuck is around the corner.
CHARLOTTE	My next great
IRANDA	Yes?
(ALL)	Say it.
CHARLOTTE	fuck is just around the corner.
CHARLOTTE	I finally get to sleep with Trey.
CARRIE	Excuse me?
IRANDA	You haven't slept with him yet?
SAMANTHA	"Before you buy the car, you take it for a test drive."
CHARLOTTE	I wanted to save myself until we got married.
CARRIE	"Sweetie, you're not a virgin."
CHARLOTTE	"I am with him, and it's romantic."
SAMANTHA	It's romantic until he can't figure out where to put it in.
CHARLOTTE	no.
SAMANTHA	What if he's terrible?
CHARLOTTE	He won't be terrible.
CHARLOTTE	No.
CHARLOTTE	He is an amazing kisser.
SAMANTHA	Really?
CHARLOTTE	"He's so sexy, and he loves me."
CHARLOTTE	I want to do things to him that I have never done to anybody.
CHARLOTTE	"The other night, I was thinking of putting whipped cream all over my body."
SAMANTHA	Low fat Cool Whip is the best.
SAMANTHA	It's less sticky than other brands.
CHARLOTTE	low fat Cool Whip.
IRANDA	You haven't slept with him!
CHARLOTTE	It's been Too long! I am so horny.
SAMANTHA	Horny.
CARRIE	Those of us not getting married celebrated with a booty call.
HARRIS	I'm so glad you called.
IRANDA	As soon as I landed.
CARRIE	Samantha's vertical Scotch tasting that turned into a horizontal one.
CALEB	I had no idea you Yanks were so bloody friendly.
CARRIE	"She couldn't understand him, but understood he was hard."
CARRIE	"I decided to crawl into bed with Aidan, but he wasn't in his bed."
AIDAN	"Hey, beautiful."
AIDAN	What brings you down here?
CARRIE	I was trying to surprise you.
AIDAN	You can't surprise a man with a dog.
CARRIE	I see that.
CARRIE	What are you working on?
AIDAN	the wedding gift.
CARRIE	this is for Charlotte and Trey?
AIDAN	You wanted to give them a piece of my furniture.
CARRIE	You didn't have to make something.
CARRIE	We could have picked a piece.
AIDAN	I make all that stuff too.
CARRIE	"I know, but this is too nice."
AIDAN	I wanted it to mean something.
CARRIE	"God, I was about to get them steak knives."
CARRIE	What does it mean?
AIDAN	It's a love seat.
CARRIE	That I get.
AIDAN	It's two different types of wood from two different trees.
AIDAN	"They blend together and make it stronger, just like"
CARRIE	A mixed drink.
AIDAN	kind Of like two people in love.
CARRIE	"Right, That too."
AIDAN	Are you gonna make fun of this?
CARRIE	It's really nicer than anyone deserves.
AIDAN	You see this piece?
AIDAN	This big old flaw right here?
AIDAN	"It's not a flaw, really. It's just the way the wood is."
AIDAN	It's interesting.
AIDAN	Beautiful.
CARRIE	Flaws can be good?.
AIDAN	Flaws are the best part
CARRIE	This was the time to tell him.
CARRIE	I could feel the words inside me.
CARRIE	"But if I told him, could he still love me? I wasn't ready to find out."
CARRIE	There was another booty call that night.
CHARLOTTE	"Hi, sweetiekins."
TREY	"Charlotte Yorke, are you drunk?"
CHARLOTTE	Yes.
CHARLOTTE	"Yes, I am, Trey MacDougal."
CHARLOTTE	And today is officially our wedding day.
CHARLOTTE	And I can't wait any longer.
CHARLOTTE	Could we please make love right now?
TREY	are You sure?
CHARLOTTE	"Oh, Yes, I am."
CHARLOTTE	Take me to your bedroom now.
TREY	All righty then.
TREY	That was unfortunate.
CHARLOTTE	Has this ever happened to you before?
TREY	Every now and then.
TREY	I just didn't think it would happen with you.
TREY	It's no big deal.
TREY	Sometimes intercourse just doesn't do it for me.
TREY	"I can get the sails up, just can't bring it into the harbor."
CHARLOTTE	is There Anything I can do?
TREY	"Yes, There is."
CHARLOTTE	What?
TREY	You can marry me.
CHARLOTTE	I'm already doing that.
TREY	"I love You, Charlotte."
TREY	Sex is such a small part of it for us.
TREY	That's what I love about you.
TREY	It's not just about the sex.
CARRIE	Charlotte couldn't sleep at all that night.
CARRIE	Neither could l.
CARRIE	All I could think about was that I was a cheater.
CARRIE	"I cheated and lied in fifth grade, and I was still doing it."
AIDAN	This isn't gonna work.
CARRIE	What do You mean? Us?
AIDAN	I can't have you sneaking out at 3:00 in the morning for a cigarette.
CARRIE	I tried to quit.
CARRIE	I just couldn't.
AIDAN	Well I'll just have to learn to live with it.
CARRIE	You said you can't date a smoker.
AIDAN	You're not just a smoker.
AIDAN	You're a lot of things.
AIDAN	I'm not perfect.
CARRIE	"Oh, yeah? What's your flaw?"
AIDAN	You tell me.
CARRIE	I don't know.
CARRIE	That was another lie.
CARRIE	I knewwhat his flawwas.
CARRIE	It was trusting me with his heart.
CARRIE	"Aidan, I need to Tell You something."
AIDAN	what?
CARRIE	But suddenly I couldn't tell him.
CARRIE	I was afraid he'd never look at me that way again.
CARRIE	So I didn't.

AIDAN	"I love you, too."
AIDAN	Let's go back and go to bed.
CARRIE	"No, I should get home."

IRANDA	I cut my finger.
HARRIS	Jesus.
IRANDA	It's OK.

IRANDA	What should I do?
HARRIS	I don't know.
IRANDA	It's deep.
IRANDA	Do I need stitches?

IRANDA	You lied?
HARRIS	I'm sorry.
HARRIS	I always wanted to sleep with a stewardess.
CARRIE	"For a moment, Miranda considered coming clean."
CARRIE	"But then they'd both be liars, and he wouldn't have slept with a stewardess."
IRANDA	You should go.
IRANDA	I hope I never have you on one of my flights.
HARRIS	I wouldn't be on first class.
IRANDA	"No, you wouldn't."
CARRIE	I'm running late.
CARRIE	Charlotte will never forgive me.
CARRIE	I need to
CARRIE	What's that?
AIDAN	The wedding gift.
CARRIE	That love seat packs up nice.
AIDAN	It's a Polaroid.
AIDAN	You look too hot to be a bridesmaid.
AIDAN	I thought the whole point was to wear a bad dress and be humiliated.
CARRIE	It's not that kind of wedding.
AIDAN	I thought maybe one day I'd build us a love seat.
CARRIE	We're gonna be late.
CARRIE	I'm just gonna grab my I was supposed to be at the church ten minutes ago.
AIDAN	You never let me hold you anymore.
AIDAN	Why do You Keep running away?

AIDAN	You slept with that guy? When we were going out? Once?
CARRIE	"No, more than Once."
CARRIE	He was married.
CARRIE	It was a mess.
CARRIE	I don't knowwhat I was thinking.

SAMANTHA	She'll be here.
BUNNY	"Charlotte, my grandmother's necklace looks beautiful on you."
CALEB	Could I escort You to your seat?
BUNNY	Excuse me?
SAMANTHA	He asked if he could escort you to your seat.
BUNNY	Certainly.
BUNNY	I guess it's time.
SAMANTHA	"They do wear something under kilts, but it's easy to get off."
CARRIE	The wedding was complete.
CARRIE	"Charlotte had something old, something new, something borrowed, and someone Samantha blew."
CARRIE	I'm sorry I'm so late.
CHARLOTTE	It's OK.
CHARLOTTE	I'm glad you're here.

CHARLOTTE	Trey can't get it up.
CARRIE	what?
CHARLOTTE	Last night he couldn't get it up.
CARRIE	was he drunk?
CHARLOTTE	No.
CHARLOTTE	"I was drunk, he was fine."
CARRIE	Then it must have been wedding-night jitters.
CHARLOTTE	He says it happens sometimes.
CARRIE	"Since she was in the white dress, I reached for a white lie."
CARRIE	Happens to everybody.
CHARLOTTE	I should have slept with him on the first date.
CARRIE	"Maybe he jerked off before you got there, and he was too embarrassed to tell you."
CHARLOTTE	I do love him.
CARRIE	and he loves you.
CHARLOTTE	Maybe he did jerk off.
CARRIE	"If you don't wanna go through this, you don't have to."

IRANDA	Sure.
CARRIE	"Hey, you."
AIDAN	I walked around for about an hour.
AIDAN	Couldn't bring myself to go in.
CARRIE	"I'm so sorry, Aidan."
AIDAN	I knowthat.
CARRIE	I never meant to hurt you.
AIDAN	I know.
CARRIE	But I did.
CARRIE	I'm sorry.
CARRIE	"Couldn't it be like the wood? That's my flaw, and and you're the other wood, and that makes us stronger."
AIDAN	"It's not that simple, Carrie."
AIDAN	I wish I didn't know about this.
CARRIE	I just wanted to be honest with you.
CARRIE	People make mistakes.
AIDAN	I just know myself.
AIDAN	This is not the kind of thing I can get over.
AIDAN	I just need to be on my own for a while.
AIDAN	Me on my own.
AIDAN	I really loved you.
IRANDA	"Carrie, they need us for photos."
CARRIE	oK.
CARRIE	I told him.
CARRIE	It's hard to find people who will love you no matter what.
PHOTOGRAPHER	Here we go.
PHOTOGRAPHER	Smile.
PHOTOGRAPHER	Everybody looks beautiful.
CARRIE	I was lucky enough to find three of them.
CARRIE	"NewYork City dreary, gray, miserable."
CARRIE	"Or was that just me? After a sordid affair with my ex-boyfriend, and a break-up with my current one, it was time for a change of scenery."
CARRIE	And I wasn't alone.
CHARLOTTE	You're going to LA without me!
IRANDA	You went on your honeymoon without us.
CHARLOTTE	I have pictures.
CARRIE	"While we planned our escape, Charlotte celebrated her return."
CARRIE	She and Trey had just returned from Bermuda.
CHARLOTTE	"Here, Trey and I are playing golf."
SAMANTHA	Do you think the studio will send a limo to pick us up?

SAMANTHA	I know.
SAMANTHA	I was just practicing my LA spin.
CHARLOTTE	Here's one of Trey pretending to get a hole in one.

CARRIE	What's with this hill? LA is supposed to be flat.
IRANDA	they mean culturally.
SAMANTHA	The hotel's there.
IRANDA	To get there we have to go up this hill.
SAMANTHA	That's enough.
SAMANTHA	Stop.
SAMANTHA	I'm not going to die in this tin can.
SAMANTHA	I have a date with a dildo.
CARRIE	I'm sorry.
IRANDA	oK.
IRANDA	"Come on, we're gonna do it."

CARRIE	My God.
CARRIE	"Thank you, Matthew McConaughey."
ATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY	"You're welcome, Carrie Bradshaw."
ATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY	Here's what I've been thinking about how do we get your column to translate to the silver screen? I think I've got the answer.
ATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY	What if we flush out the central relationship? -
CARRIE	OK.
CARRIE	The central relationship.
ATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY	Carrie and Mr.
ATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY	Big.
ATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY	I don't see why they couldn't make it work.
CARRIE	I couldn't believe it.
CARRIE	"I flew 3,000 miles to have Matthew McConaughey ask what I've asked myself for years? Look at him."
ATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY	He is such a great guy.
ATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY	I don't know anybody any cooler than Mr.
ATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY	Big.
ATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY	"The only question is, ""What the fuck is Carrie's problem?"" What do you think?"
CARRIE	Well I don't particularly think it was just her problem.
CARRIE	He had some commitment issues.
ATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY	"That's bullshit, Carrie, and you know it."
ATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY	Cut.
ATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY	Kidding.
ATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY	I'm acting.
ATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY	That's what I do.
ATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY	See what I mean? That's why I wanna develop the story with you.
ATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY	I'm Mr.
ATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY	Big.
CARRIE	"Oh, OK."
CARRIE	Well.
CARRIE	Yeah.
ATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY	That's Excellent.
ATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY	You're in.
ATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY	"You know what else? I really wanna fuck you, baby."
CARRIE	are You acting now?
ATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY	"I'm Big, OK? You be Carrie."
CARRIE	I am Carrie.
ATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY	We're animals.
ATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY	"Man, woman, walking the earth."
ATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY	"We're made of head, heart and loins."
ATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY	"We're talking about using them, am I right?"
CARRIE	I have The girl said that we would talk about the columns today.
ATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY	Let's get down to the underbelly of these two characters.
ATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY	Let's figure out why they're so fucked up.
CARRIE	"Well, I have a facial at four."
ATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY	I love you.
ATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY	I don't understand why we can't be together.
CARRIE	do You mind if I smoke?
ATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY	I don't think you should.
CARRIE	what?
ATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY	I don't think Carrie should smoke.
CARRIE	That's all right.
ATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY	Or in my office. Ok?
CARRIE	"After I left the meeting I took a wrong turn and somehow found myself right back where I had started back in New York, back wondering about Big."
CARRIE	"I had come to LA for a vacation, hoping to get away from Big, Aidan, and most of all myself."
CARRIE	"Sitting on the fake set, all my issues felt more real than ever."
CARRIE	"I couldn't help but wonder no matter how far you travel or run from it, can you ever really escape your past?"
GUARD	Ma'am? No smoking.
CARRIE	I'm outside.
CARRIE	And it's New York.
CARRIE	"In New York, the release of a new book is cause for celebration."
CARRIE	"Here in LA, a new line of sex toys will do the trick."
SAMANTHA	lsn't this fun?
CARRIE	the answer Would be no.
CARRIE	we want to go.
SAMANTHA	What? We can't leave yet.
SAMANTHA	They haven't cut the cock.

SAMANTHA	Stay! Garth is gonna autograph some dildos.
SAMANTHA	He's a big seller.
IRANDA	He's the John Grisham of penises.
SAMANTHA	I'm gonna get in line.
CARRIE	"I can't believe how open and ""Hi, have sex"" this place is."
CARRIE	"In New York sex is bottom shelf, paper bag."
IRANDA	Exactly.
IRANDA	"It's all hidden, like me."
CARRIE	What do You mean?
IRANDA	last night I talked to this Cute guy.
IRANDA	We were having a great time.
IRANDA	"Then a woman in a tight dress walked by, with big breasts just boom, here they are."
IRANDA	he totally went for it.
CARRIE	Right.
IRANDA	I wanted to have sex but it was hidden in my witty banter and my little looks.
IRANDA	she put It out There and got the guy.
CARRIE	But how long did she have him? .
IRANDA	Who cares? I'm on vacation. I wanna get laid
IRANDA	I admire women who can put it out there where you can see it.
IRANDA	Like her.
CARRIE	You want to dress like her?
IRANDA	You know What I mean.
IRANDA	Do you think there's any chance she's not up for sex?
CARRIE	"No, because she's a hooker."

SAMANTHA	You're too kind.
CARRIE	"That night, Samantha took home the Deluxe Garth."
CARRIE	"Next door, I learned that not only could I not escape my past, I couldn't escape my present."
SAMANTHA	What is it about California air? It makes me sleep so well.
CARRIE	It's not the air.
CARRIE	Your headboard knocked you unconscious.
SAMANTHA	You heard Us?
IRANDA	I didn't.
CARRIE	"No, Ms Snore, you wouldn't."

SAMANTHA	I've got something to make you feel better.
CARRIE	Dildos before 10:00am.
CARRIE	I'm all perked up.
SAMANTHA	They're autographed.
SAMANTHA	One for each.
IRANDA	"My friend went to California, and all I got was this lousy dildo."
CARRIE	Could you put these back? People are staring.
SAMANTHA	In LA no one cares if your egg whites have a side of cock.
IRANDA	Wow! Nobody needs this much.
IRANDA	The average woman is only five inches deep.
CARRIE	Is that written on your placemat?
IRANDA	the Mark Of a Fine penis is width
SAMANTHA	Couldn't agree more.
SAMANTHA	That's why you'll enjoy your presents.
CARRIE	Are you saying that Garth has the perfect girth?
SAMANTHA	Exactly.
CARRIE	"As much as I enjoy the fine life-like craftsmanship, I'm going to leave mine with you."
IRANDA	I'm holding on to mine.
IRANDA	LA isn't working out the way I had hoped.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, back in New York and still no closer to being in-put by Trey, Charlotte addressed thank you notes."
CARRIE	"Every time she licked a love stamp, it made a mockery of her marriage."
CHARLOTTE	It's me.
CHARLOTTE	It's been days and nothing.
CHARLOTTE	What if he really is impotent?
CARRIE	What kind of impotence do you think it is?
CHARLOTTE	the kind That makes It soft.
CARRIE	"No, no."
CARRIE	Physical or emotional?
CHARLOTTE	I don't know.
CARRIE	have You asked Him about it?
CHARLOTTE	He's embarrassed.
CHARLOTTE	He doesn't want to talk about it.
CARRIE	Here's what to do put a ring of paper around his penis while he's asleep.
CARRIE	I sound like a perverted Nancy Drew.
CHARLOTTE	What Does That do?
CARRIE	"If it rips overnight, he is capable of an erection."
CARRIE	The problem is not physical.
VOICE	this floor is non -smoking.
CARRIE	"I have an addiction, sir."
CHARLOTTE	a ring Of paper.
CARRIE	Yup.
CARRIE	"That night, Samantha invited Mr."
CARRIE	"Dildo out for dim sum, and then some."
GARTH	Tell me more about yourself.
GARTH	What are your interests?
SAMANTHA	Well I think that's pretty obvious.
GARTH	I'm serious.
GARTH	"Don't you wanna know more about me, my interests?"
SAMANTHA	oK.
GARTH	I'm a poet.
GARTH	I've been published in journals
CARRIE	Garth wanted Samantha to know that he was more than just a sex toy.
CARRIE	He had a soft side.
GARTH	Do you want to hear one?
CARRIE	"Far away, Charlotte was dealing with Trey's soft side as well."
CARRIE	She was going to get some answers.
CARRIE	She came to bed armed with love.
CARRIE	She went to sleep hoping her male had sufficient postage to deliver his package into her box.
CARRIE	"Back at the hotel, Samantha was waiting for a delivery of her own."
GARTH	"Once again, the leaves bloomed forth Some headed south, some headed north"
SAMANTHA	That's beautfiul. Come here.
GARTH	"Blue as a baby bird Winged and aloft My eyes search your eyes For something I've lost Samantha, I was thinking."
SAMANTHA	You were?
GARTH	we have this Great connection.
GARTH	And I've done LA.
GARTH	"How about I move to New York? I could pursue my two passions, poetry and porn."
SAMANTHA	l
GARTH	Wouldn't it be great? We could keep seeing each other.
CARRIE	"Having a fling in LA is one thing, but introducing Mr."
CARRIE	Dildo to everyone at a gala at the Met was quite another.
SAMANTHA	I don't think it would work.
SAMANTHA	I know me.
SAMANTHA	I'm much too possessive a woman to share your penis with the world.
CARRIE	"Just like that, Samantha escaped a life as Mrs."
CARRIE	Dildo.
CARRIE	She moved Garth out of her present and into her past.
CARRIE	But she took the best part of him with her.
CARRIE	I had finally found a place to escape Miranda's snoring.
CARRIE	The ghosts of my relationships past weren't so easy to shake.
CARRIE	I hadn't really moved on from Big and Aidan.
CARRIE	I'd just moved.
GUY BY POOL	Excuse me.
CARRIE	"I'll put it out, OK?"
GUY BY POOL	"No, I was wondering if I could bum one."
CARRIE	"Sorry, it was my last one."
GUY BY POOL	Do you want some company?
GUY BY POOL	are You sure You Wanna be alone?
CARRIE	I am.
CARRIE	"As soon as I said it out loud, I knew that that was what I wanted and needed."
CARRIE	Charlotte woke up as excited as a little girl on Christmas morning.
CARRIE	She couldn't wait to see if Trey's package was unwrapped.
CHARLOTTE	"Morning, morning, morning."
TREY	Good morning.
TREY	What are you so excited about?
CHARLOTTE	Nothing.
CHARLOTTE	I just love you.
TREY	"I love you, too."
CARRIE	"For the first time in weeks, Charlotte felt relieved."
CARRIE	Trey's problem wasn't physical.
CARRIE	"Then she realized, if it wasn't physical, she couldn't escape that it might be emotional."
CARRIE	There was no easy love stamp solution to fix that.
CARRIE	I am totally digging this scene.
CARRIE	It's so urban cowboy circa 1982.
SAMANTHA	All the great places in LA and we're at the Saddle Ranch Chop House?
CARRIE	"Don't complain, it's the closest bar without a hill involved."
IRANDA	This is what I'm talking about.
IRANDA	Look at her.
IRANDA	She screams sex.
IRANDA	It's so honest.
IRANDA	I wish I Could be more like that.
SAMANTHA	Stop complaining.
SAMANTHA	Do something.
ANNOUNCER	"OK, which lovely lady is gonna be next?"
IRANDA	I will.
CARRIE	"Miranda, no."
SAMANTHA	she will.
CARRIE	no.
CARRIE	Hold on.
CARRIE	"We weren't sure if it was the climate or the five beers she drank, but as soon as she got on that bull, Miranda escaped Miranda."
CARRIE	"Wow, I can see she really did need a vacation."
CARRIE	"The next day, as I pulled up to the studio, I realized, I was the one who held the key to my escape."
CARRIE	"I could go in and have someone tell me the mistakes I'd made in my past, or I could drive on and figure them out myself."
CARRIE	That's what I did.
CARRIE	"If I could master a stick shift, could a successful relationship be that far behind?"
CARRIE	"LA land of perpetual sun and sunbathing, which also makes it Iand of the perpetual bikini wax."
CARRIE	"After a week, I made an appointment with the city's waxer to the stars Alicia."
CARRIE	"She was known for her artful work, her lightning-quick hands and her indecipherable accent."
CARRIE	Excuse me?
ALICIA	All done.
ALICIA	Beautiful.
ALICIA	You look.
CARRIE	I got mugged! She took everything I've got.
SAMANTHA	"It's called ""The Brazilian Wax."
IRANDA	""" Why didn't you tell her to stop?"
CARRIE	I tried. I feel like one of those hairless dogs.
SAMANTHA	It's an aesthetic thing.
SAMANTHA	They do it here.
IRANDA	LA men are too lazy to search for anything.
CARRIE	You can't hide your light under a bush.
SAMANTHA	"Didn't she leave a triangle, a landing strip?"
CARRIE	"No, I am totally bald and freezing."
IRANDA	I Would have killed her.
CARRIE	I'm so aware of down there now.
CARRIE	I feel like I'm nothing but walking sex.
SAMANTHA	The Brazilian makes you do crazy things.
SAMANTHA	Be careful who you invite to Brazil.
IRANDA	I'm officially RSVP-ing
IRANDA	no.
CARRIE	where are You going?

CARRIE	"Yeah, one's a feisty waitress."
SAMANTHA	What are You and Lew gonna do?
IRANDA	We'll have drinks and bitch about LA.
IRANDA	I can't believe he lives here now.
CARRIE	Tell Him to move to Brazil.
IRANDA	You're on your own tonight.
CARRIE	We'll go to that movie premiere.
SAMANTHA	What's the movie?
CARRIE	"Oh, no one sees the movie. We'll use my press pass and get into the after party."
SAMANTHA	I love LA.
IRANDA	You two should get out Of the sun.
CARRIE	Lew asked Miranda to meet him at The Flowing Tree.
CARRIE	"Surrounded by all these tanned, fit, happy people, she knew she would recognize pale, chubby, unhappy Lew immediately."
LEW	Miranda.
IRANDA	"Oh, my God!"

LEW	"No, here."
LEW	This place is known for its green tea infusions.
IRANDA	"Please infusions? Could LA be any worse? Take off that hat, I'm gonna shoot you right now."
LEW	I really like it here.
IRANDA	Where's the guy I shared beers with and made fun of happy people? I know.
LEW	"The thing is, I think I'm one of those happy people now."
IRANDA	Good for you!

LEW	I was supremely unhappy in NewYork.
LEW	"I came here, and I let a lot of that old toxic anger go."
LEW	"I take things slowly, get outside LA agrees with me."
CARRIE	"Miranda realized, she was the one standing out."
CARRIE	She was the only angry New Yorker for miles.

KEITH	"OK, sure."
KEITH	"Tell her that when she's ready to deal, she can call me herself."

KEITH	You aren't going anywhere.
SAMANTHA	if You say so.
KEITH	"Let's go inside, just enjoy our evening."
CARRIE	"Once we got inside, our magic carpet ride really began."
KEITH	I can't believe they wouldn't let you in.
KEITH	That's a disconnect.
CARRIE	a disconnect?
KEITH	Yeah.
KEITH	It's like a fuck-up.
CARRIE	A disconnect!
KEITH	Yeah. You writers are word Nazis.
CARRIE	You're gonna ride me with that.
CARRIE	"Someone's ass is ringing, and it ain't mine."
KEITH	Yours would if it could.
KEITH	It would ring.
KEITH	"Excuse me, I'll just be one second."
KEITH	Enjoy yourself.
CARRIE	That is one tall drink ofwater.
CARRIE	She had worshipped Hugh Hefner since she was old enough to steal her father's Playboys.
CARRIE	This wasn't a celebrity sighting.
CARRIE	This was the celebrity sighting.
SAMANTHA	I'll be back.
SAMANTHA	"Hugh, hi."

CARRIE	"Back home, Charlotte had never felt more inside."
CARRIE	She had just attended her first black tie doctors' benefit.
TREY	we make a Fine looking couple.
CHARLOTTE	"Yes, we do."
CHARLOTTE	"So, how did I do?"
TREY	"Mrs MacDougal, you did quite well."
CHARLOTTE	"Thank you, Dr MacDougal."
CHARLOTTE	"You know, doctor, I have an itch."
CHARLOTTE	"Could you help me out with it? Trey? Maybe it's time we thought about some options, like Viagra."
TREY	Are you aware that Viagra is a killer for men with heart problems? My father died of a heart attack.
TREY	It runs in my family.
CARRIE	Trey wasn't the only one with heart problems.
CHARLOTTE	I'm just trying to help.
TREY	Now I'm tense.
TREY	I'm going for a run.
CARRIE	It was the fifth time he'd gone running at bedtime in the last two weeks.
CARRIE	"The next day, Samantha decided to get some exercise as well."
CARRIE	Her pocketbook was getting most of the workout.
FENDI MAN	"Fendi, 150."
CARRIE	She decided to give her old pocketbook a rest.
CARRIE	"As Charlotte picked up my mail, she realized she missed more than her sex life."
CARRIE	She missed her single life.
CARRIE	"If Trey could run away from their problems, so could she."
CHARLOTTE	I can't deal with Trey.
CARRIE	calling might be more economical.
CHARLOTTE	And I really missed you guys.
CARRIE	We missed you too.
CARRIE	Trey is
CHARLOTTE	It's not working.
CHARLOTTE	He refuses to even talk about it.
CARRIE	I take it you'll be staying?
CHARLOTTE	I need a vacation.
CARRIE	You came to the right place.
CARRIE	I gotta meet this Keith guy.
CARRIE	Miranda and Samantha are down by the pool.
CARRIE	"Charlotte glanced at the glistening pool, and just like that, her marriage and Trey seemed far away."
CARRIE	"Before lunch, I agreed to go with Keith to see a house he was interested in."
CARRIE	This is not a house.
CARRIE	This is an airport.
REALTOR	It's Lorenzo Lamas'.
REALTOR	He's asking 3.
REALTOR	"4, but it'll go for 3.2"
CARRIE	"There's a bargain! In New York, a first date is dinner and a movie."
CARRIE	"In LA, it's lunch and seeing a 3."
CARRIE	4 million dollar house.
KEITH	What do you think?
CARRIE	I should work in television.
KEITH	"It's good, right?"
CARRIE	It's really good.
CARRIE	But does a single guy like you need this much space?
KEITH	Probably not.
KEITH	"But come on, it looks good."
CARRIE	So did he.
CARRIE	"In the South American's living room, my Brazilian made me kiss him."
REALTOR	Wait till you see the hot tub.
KEITH	we should Check out the hot tub.
CARRIE	Okey -dokey.
CHARLOTTE	"I'll have the omelet with no cheese, but tomatoes and mushrooms."
CHARLOTTE	"Instead of the fries a side of fruit with no grapes, and a half decaf skim."
WAITRESS	You should get the mushrooms steamed.
WAITRESS	It lightens the calories but retains the flavor.
CHARLOTTE	"Great, thanks."
CHARLOTTE	I really like LA.
CARRIE	Who wouldn't? Keith wants a $3 million house and I can't afford new curtains.
SAMANTHA	That's where the guys here have New York men beat real estate.
IRANDA	Lew May be the perfect guy.
CHARLOTTE	Letterman Lew?
IRANDA	Yeah.
IRANDA	He's an ideal combination of the two coasts.
IRANDA	"He's a New Yorker at heart, but he's lost all his neuroses and 30 pounds."
CARRIE	We're New Yorkers.
CARRIE	Aren't we supposed to like neurotic guys?
SAMANTHA	The Woody Allen thing is so over
IRANDA	He's a changed man.
IRANDA	He's spiritual and happy.
IRANDA	he met the Dalai Lama.
SAMANTHA	I met Hugh Hefner.
CARRIE	One woman's pornographer is another woman's spiritual leader.
IRANDA	Maybe he's on to something.
IRANDA	Maybe it's time I stopped being angry.
CARRIE	how Would You spend your time?
SAMANTHA	I'll tell you what you could do.
SAMANTHA	Shop.
IRANDA	Jesus!
CARRIE	"No, you didn't!"
CHARLOTTE	"That's like $3,000."
SAMANTHA	Or 150.
SAMANTHA	Fake.
CARRIE	no.
CHARLOTTE	It looks So real.
SAMANTHA	I know.
CARRIE	Give me that.
SAMANTHA	You'd never know it wasn't real unless you looked at the lining.
CARRIE	I don't have that luxury.
CARRIE	All my insides are on the outside now.
IRANDA	I don't like fakes.
SAMANTHA	All That matters is What It looks like.
CARRIE	It's good.
SAMANTHA	We could get more.
SAMANTHA	I got the guy's card.
SAMANTHA	"He lives in the ""Valley""."
CHARLOTTE	Could You have more condoms?
SAMANTHA	I did.
CHARLOTTE	I am so happy to be out of that condom stage of life.
IRANDA	"I thought it was called ""my thirties""."
CHARLOTTE	It's nice to go to bed with the same man every night.
IRANDA	Tell me you didn't come to LA to tell us how much sex you're having.
CARRIE	Charlotte couldn't tell them her conjugal bliss was a conjugal miss.
CHARLOTTE	What should I do first in LA?
SAMANTHA	The first thing you'll need is a good bikini wax.
IRANDA	You should try Alicia.
CARRIE	"That night, after hours of pool time, I realized something startling."
CARRIE	I was actually starting to like LA.
CARRIE	"New Yorkers are trained to hate Los Angeles, where, supposedly, intellect is ridiculed and who you date and what you look like is revered."
CARRIE	"Yet, we were having the time of our lives."
CARRIE	"The men were happy, the homes were huge, the bags looked great."
CARRIE	Maybe that was enough.
CARRIE	The weather moves from west to east.
CARRIE	"Was it a just matter of time before the truth blew across Manhattan? When it comes to bags, men and cities, is it really what's outside that counts? The next day, Samantha and l went to the Valley for Fendi bags."
SAMANTHA	"This is it, 45386."
CARRIE	is That an address Or a zip code?
SAMANTHA	I don't know.
CARRIE	I miss Lorenzo Lamas' neighborhood.
CARRIE	my god.
SAMANTHA	"Oh, There he is."
CARRIE	We had found it.
CARRIE	Fake Fendi paradise.
CARRIE	He should work on his display area.
FENDI MAN	"Seven for 1,000. You like?"
CARRIE	I should have liked them.
CARRIE	"But staring into the trunk, they didn't look elegant."
CARRIE	They looked cheap.
CARRIE	"Even if everyone else thought it was real, I'd always know, my bag came from a trunk deep in the Valley."
CARRIE	You know what? I don't think so.
SAMANTHA	You don't want a bag now?
CARRIE	Sorry.
CARRIE	They're very nice.
CARRIE	It's just
FENDI MAN	"Please, don't smoke near the bags."
SAMANTHA	We drove for two hours in the Valley
SAMANTHA	That's it.
SAMANTHA	I'm going back to the hotel.
CARRIE	They looked so sad staring up at me from that trunk.
IRANDA	They were waiting to be adopted.
SAMANTHA	I was almost eaten by dogs.
SAMANTHA	The least you could've done was buy a bag.
CARRIE	It's better to wait for the real thing.
CARRIE	Then at least you know it's special.
CHARLOTTE	my marriage is a fake Fendi.
IRANDA	Excuse me?
CHARLOTTE	"Trey and I look like the perfect couple from the outside, but on the inside it's all fake."
CHARLOTTE	It's not special.
CHARLOTTE	He can't get it up.
SAMANTHA	what?
CHARLOTTE	We've never had sex.
SAMANTHA	You've never had sex?
IRANDA	You've been married for
CHARLOTTE	over a month.
SAMANTHA	You've never had sex?
CARRIE	"It's not physical, it's emotional."
IRANDA	You knew about this?
CARRIE	she told me at the wedding.
CHARLOTTE	You'd just say you'd told me so and I shouldn't have married so quickly.
IRANDA	Who am I to judge you? We all have our own paths in life.
CARRIE	Three days with Lew had changed Miranda from deeply sarcastic to Deepak Chopra.
CHARLOTTE	What am I gonna do?
SAMANTHA	You've never had sex?.
CARRIE	She's never had sex.
IRANDA	It's only been a month.
SAMANTHA	He hasn't seen Brazil.
CARRIE	a honeymoon to South America.
CARRIE	That might do the trick.
SAMANTHA	I know how to cheer You up.
SAMANTHA	A trip to the Playboy mansion.
SAMANTHA	Hef invited us for one of those Playmate pool parties.
CARRIE	"Did you say, ""Hef""?"
IRANDA	Why would that cheer her up? Does she look like a frat boy?
SAMANTHA	"No, but it wouldn't hurt to meet some."
CARRIE	"Sorry, not going."
SAMANTHA	"come on, It Would be fun."
SAMANTHA	We're in LA.
CARRIE	"All right, fine, but I better be on the guest list."
CARRIE	"Later that night, I was a guest at Keith's amazing house."
CARRIE	"He made sizzling scallops, and after dinner things got even hotter."
CARRIE	I like hot tubs.
CARRIE	NewYork should have more hot tubs like on roofs and stuff.
KEITH	"Well, if you like that"
CARRIE	"While I was going native with Keith, Miranda and Lew went to New York."
CARRIE	At least to the New York strip steak.
IRANDA	this looks great.
LEW	"God, do I miss this smell!"
IRANDA	"So, you were saying?"
LEW	"Read ""Zen And The Art Of Modern Living""."
IRANDA	I'm still trying to get used to bath beans.
LEW	You are So New York.
IRANDA	"Come on, don't you miss it? Just a little?"
LEW	"No, I write about It every day."
IRANDA	"That's not New York, it's a sound stage."
IRANDA	20 somethings with tiny salaries don't live in SoHo lofts.
IRANDA	It's totally fake.
LEW	I think 40 million viewers would disagree with you on that one.
IRANDA	is something wrong with your steak?
LEW	"No, it's great."
IRANDA	What are You doing?
LEW	I'm tasting my food.
IRANDA	Why aren't you swallowing it?
LEW	You think I look this good by eating?
CARRIE	"Lew hadn't found inner peace, he'd found an eating disorder."
IRANDA	are You serious?
LEW	Don't put your toxic shit on me.
LEW	This is LA.
LEW	You have no idea what pressure I'm under.
IRANDA	Who cares what you look like.
IRANDA	You're a writer.
LEW	For a hit show.
LEW	No one wants to hire a fat story editor.
CARRIE	Miranda wanted to rip that Knicks hat off his head.
CARRIE	No self-respecting New Yorker would spit out that good a steak.
LEW	Jesus fucking Christ.
LEW	Now I've lost my appetite.
CARRIE	"Waking up in Keith's sun-filled bedroom, I felt like 3."
CARRIE	4 million myself.
KEITH	I like what you have going on down there.
CARRIE	That Would be a whole lot Of Nothing.
KEITH	Yeah.
CARRIE	Don't you work?
KEITH	I don't have anything until 11.
CARRIE	Nice life.
KEITH	Yeah.
CARRIE FISHER	"What the fuck do you think you're doing? I told you, no prostitutes when you're house-sitting."
CARRIE	You're a house-sitter?
KEITH	Personal assistant.
CARRIE	I thought You were an agent.
CARRIE FISHER	My agent won't water my plants.
CARRIE	"The life I was coveting wasn't Keith's, it was Carrie Fisher's."
CARRIE FISHER	You're so fired.
CARRIE FISHER	Wait till I tell Penny.
KEITH	am I going to have to return her car?
CARRIE	And Penny Marshall's.
CARRIE	I'm going to
CARRIE FISHER	You might need these.
CARRIE	Thank you.
CARRIE FISHER	Are you going to bring prostitutes to Ben's new $3 million home?
CARRIE	And Ben Affleck's.
CARRIE	I'm not a prostitute.
CARRIE	I'm Carrie Bradshaw.
CARRIE	I'm a writer too.
CARRIE	I have a column in New York.
CARRIE	"I'm Carrie, you're Carrie."
CARRIE	"I write, you write."
CARRIE FISHER	I have a child.
CARRIE FISHER	I really can't do this.
CARRIE FISHER	Have you been smoking in here?
KEITH	This was always on.
KEITH	"The dry-cleaning and the cat food, that's all done."
CARRIE	It was the perfect ending to my week of make-believe a visit to the Playboy mansion and the Playmate pool party.
IRANDA	Could our lives get Any weirder?
CARRIE	Nothing surprises me Any more.
CARRIE	"In LA, house-sitters are somebodies and writers are prostitutes."
SAMANTHA	You're at least a high-class escort.
CARRIE	Thank you.
IRANDA	Fuck Carrie Fisher!
CARRIE	Now we're angry again?
IRANDA	Yeah.
CARRIE	I blame the wax.
SAMANTHA	That's it.
SAMANTHA	Blame it on Rio.
CARRIE	"After the sun went down, the party really started heating up."
IRANDA	Where are the girls in the satin outfits and the Bunny ears?
CARRIE	"Yeah, I want to see some Bunny ears."
CARRIE	"Somewhere between the ltalian grotto and the petting zoo, Charlotte found something real."
CARRIE	His name was lan.
IAN	So I started collecting Hockney.
CHARLOTTE	I love Hockney.
CHARLOTTE	The colors in his pool series are so LA.
CHARLOTTE	The blues and those deep greens.
IAN	"God, it is such a pleasure talking to an intelligent woman for once."
CHARLOTTE	I love talking to you too.
CHARLOTTE	It's nice to be with a man who talks.
CHARLOTTE	I love LA.
IAN	I guess that third welcome drink has finally kicked in?
CHARLOTTE	This is bad of me. Is this bad of me? I'm drunk.
CHARLOTTE	I'm lying here with a man I hardly know.
IAN	It's the Playboy mansion.
IAN	Things could be worse.
CHARLOTTE	"You're nice, lan."
CHARLOTTE	You're really nice.
IAN	You're nice too.
IAN	let me buy You some boobs.
CHARLOTTE	Pardon me?
IAN	It's a gift.
CHARLOTTE	I don't need any breasts.
CARRIE	Charlotte had forgotten how awful single life could be.
CARRIE	"Marriage, with all its problems, wasn't looking so bad."
SAMANTHA	someone stole my fake Fendi.
CHARLOTTE	are You sure?
SAMANTHA	I put it beside me.
SAMANTHA	"When I got up, it was gone."
SAMANTHA	"Oh my God, that Bunny's got my bag."
SAMANTHA	Give me my bag.
SAMANTHA	You stole my bag.
PLAYMATE	this is my bag.
HUGH HEFNER	are we having a problem?
SAMANTHA	This Bunny stole my bag.
PLAYMATE	It's my bag.
HUGH HEFNER	She says it's her bag.
SAMANTHA	Look on the inside.
SAMANTHA	"A label that says ""Made in China"" and there's a bunch of condoms in there."
PLAYMATE	Fendi.
CARRIE	Samantha was mortified.
CARRIE	She thought everything on the Bunny was fake.
SAMANTHA	OK then.
SAMANTHA	Innocent mistake.
CARRIE	"Apparently, one nod from Hef, and the pool party was over."
SAMANTHA	I'm not leaving without my friends.
CHARLOTTE	I'm so sorry.
CARRIE	"The fake Fendi ended up costing 150 for the bag, unspecified costs to Samantha's ego."
CARRIE	And Miranda and I took a wrong turn on the way to the buffet.
IRANDA	Look at that tit soup.
CARRIE	It's time to go home.
CHARLOTTE	There you are.
CHARLOTTE	we have to leave.
CARRIE	we are.
SAMANTHA	Right now.
SAMANTHA	Relax.
SAMANTHA	"We're going, we're going."
CARRIE	What did she do?
IRANDA	I don't know.
CARRIE	What happened? OK.
CARRIE	All right.
CARRIE	"The next day, four New Yorkers left LA a little lighter."
CARRIE	"Some of us had lost our hair, and all of us had lost a little dignity."
CARRIE	Samantha couldn't wait to get back to the crime-free streets of Manhattan.
CARRIE	Miranda couldn't wait to get back to men who swallowed.
CARRIE	Charlotte couldn't wait to get back to Trey.
CARRIE	"And as for me, I couldn't wait."
	You can't smoke in here.
CARRIE	"Relax, we're going."
CARRIE	"Six hours later, I was home."
CARRIE	"It looked even better on the inside than I remembered it, because inside it was all real."
CARRIE	I was starting to feel like myself again.
CARRIE	The rest of me would grow back eventually.
CARRIE	"If you live in NewYork for ten years, you can call yourself a New Yorker."
CARRIE	But the trained eye can always spot the ones who were born here.
JENNY BRIER	"I want it all, I want it now, and I want you to get it for me."
CARRIE	"After firing her last two publicists, Jenny Brier, the daughter of a restaurateur, had decided that Samantha would take over the PR for her upcoming party."
JENNY BRIER	"I want ""Vanity Fair"", Carson Daly, ""People"", ""Teen People"", NSYNC"
SAMANTHA	"Jenny, sweetie."
SAMANTHA	"Don't take this the wrong way, but how old are you?"
JENNY BRIER	It's my Bat Mitzvah party.
JENNY BRIER	I'm 13.
SAMANTHA	You're 13?
SAMANTHA	"What are you, 45?"
CARRIE	"Just like that, the meeting was over."
SAMANTHA	"I'm sorry, I don't do kids' parties."
JENNY BRIER	"Sweetie, my father has invited over 300 of his powerful friends."
JENNY BRIER	They are not all coming.
JENNY BRIER	The Clintons can't make it.
JENNY BRIER	I told Daddy we'll be lucky if we can swing this for under a mill.
JENNY BRIER	But what do I know? I'm just a kid.
SAMANTHA	We'll never get NSYNC.
CARRIE	"After meeting her new client, Samantha met us for the latest trend in power lunching haute cafeteria cuisine."
CARRIE	"Coming in for a landing, sister?"
IRANDA	Cute guy.
IRANDA	Thought he was checking me out for a second.
ALL	Where?
IRANDA	Don't turn
SAMANTHA	He's a cutie all right.
CARRIE	Definitely looking.
IRANDA	"Looking at you looking at him, like I asked you not to."
CARRIE	take your tray over there.
IRANDA	no.
SAMANTHA	Why not?
IRANDA	"This isn't PS 147, we're adults now."
IRANDA	She's married.
IRANDA	We have to at least pretend to know better.
IRANDA	I saw a doctor about my headaches.
CARRIE	Still looking.
IRANDA	Which you're not helping.
IRANDA	I've been trying to diagnose myself on the lnternet.
CHARLOTTE	You can do that?
IRANDA	"Type in your symptoms and wait for the word ""cancer"" to appear."
IRANDA	"Anyway, turns out I'm a tongue-thruster."
SAMANTHA	"If you were a man, that would be a good thing."
IRANDA	"My tongue pushes against my teeth, so my bite is all off."
IRANDA	my dentist thinks I have TMJ.
CARRIE	You have to do something.
IRANDA	I'm going to the orthodontist.
CARRIE	"No, I mean he's really cute."
SAMANTHA	she Could write Him a note.
CARRIE	even cuter.
IRANDA	"Guys, I'm not writing him a note."
CARRIE	Dear Mr. CutieCute
IRANDA	You did not write that.
CARRIE	Just your phone number.
IRANDA	I'm not giving him my number.
CARRIE	"Relax, TMJ."
CARRIE	You don't have to.
CARRIE	I'll do it for you.
IRANDA	Carrie.
SAMANTHA	"Go, girl."
IRANDA	"Oh, my god."
CARRIE	Hi.
CARRIE	"I'm sorry to bother you, but my friend Miranda over there"
IRANDA	"Oh, my god."
CARRIE	She thinks you're cute.
LANCE	Please tell your friend Miranda to call me.
CARRIE	"On the way home, I decided to brave the afternoon heat to see if my shoe repair guy could do anything about my old soles."
CARRIE	"But when I got there, there was no ""there"" there."
CARRIE	What happened to Artie?
WADE	Artie?
CARRIE	"My guy, my shoe guy."
CARRIE	He fixed these the last time.
WADE	He moved back to Williamsburg.
WADE	"Brooklyn, not Colonial."
WADE	He couldn't afford the place once they destabilized the rent.
WADE	"If the comic business keeps going the way it is, I won't be able to either."
CARRIE	"Comics aren't selling, huh?"
WADE	"No, especially mine."
CARRIE	"Power Lad, by Wade Adams."
CARRIE	Is this you? Did you drawthis?
CARRIE	What's so powerful about him?
WADE	"He's a superhero, or he wants to be."
WADE	His parents were superheroes.
WADE	He's trying to find his super-powers.
WADE	They haven't kicked in yet.
WADE	It's stupid.
WADE	What do you do?
CARRIE	I'm a writer.
WADE	That's cool.
WADE	What do you write?
CARRIE	Turn to page seven of your newspaper.
WADE	"Yes, I thought you looked familiar."
WADE	Would You like to write comics?
CARRIE	Aren't they a boy thing?
WADE	"No! There are women superheroes Batgirl, Supergirl, Black Canary You've heard ofWonder Woman."
CARRIE	With the bracelets and the tiara.
CARRIE	I used to love that even her accessories had super-powers.
CARRIE	"Oh, man."
CARRIE	What's wrong with them?
WADE	"To them, you are Wonder Woman."
CARRIE	"All Right, stop."
CARRIE	I'll buy some.
WADE	All Right.
CARRIE	I never did get my shoes fixed.
CARRIE	"But the next week, I got new boots."
CARRIE	"I don't know what came over me, but I felt compelled to thank him."
CARRIE	"Even as a superhero, I was powerless to resist."
CARRIE	"That evening, inspired by Miranda's digital diagnosis, Charlotte went surfing for a cure for Trey's condition."
CARRIE	"There it was, in both the on and off-positions."
CARRIE	"$8,000 worth of hydraulics that could turn Trey into the Bionic Man."
CARRIE	"Ordinarily, this was something Charlotte would shy away from, but since her marriage was shy of wood That night, I met Wade Adams alias Power Lad at Bar Code, a Times Square bar that specialized in real drinks and virtual reality."
CARRIE	"I can't believe this place, it's like ten bucks a game."
WADE	"Yeah, but games come with beer."
CARRIE	They want you to play half as well and twice as much.
WADE	Sounds good to me.
WADE	What will it be Bloodburst or Terrorfright ll?
CARRIE	Whatever happened to Frogger and Miss Pacman?
WADE	she got Married.
CARRIE	"Man, where have I been?"
WADE	"I don't know, but wanna go to Mars?"
CARRIE	For ten bucks? It's a bargain.
WADE	Let's go.
CARRIE	"Without leaving the building, Power Lad took me to the furthest reaches of the galaxy and right back to seventh grade."
WADE	There we go.
CARRIE	"Oh, god."
TREY	It was maddening.
TREY	"Bram and Pippin liked the '78 Lafite, which was entirely acceptable."
CARRIE	The implant's on/off-switch had Charlotte thinking about Trey's.
CARRIE	"She was desperate to turn his on, but didn't know where to find it."
TREY	The joke was on him.
TREY	We ordered both.
TREY	Howwas your day?
CHARLOTTE	I went to the gallery in the morning and the framer's in the afternoon.
CHARLOTTE	Then I found this on the lnternet.
CHARLOTTE	See?
TREY	What on earth is this? What are you getting at?
CHARLOTTE	Just that We've tried everything else and we still You haven'tin myever So I thought
TREY	You can't be serious.
CHARLOTTE	What other options do we have?
CARRIE	"Five beers, four video games, 102 degrees outside later"
CARRIE	You gotta be kidding.
WADE	what? this is fun.
WADE	It's cheaper than taking cabs.
WADE	"Besides, all the kids got them."
WADE	Wanna try it?
CARRIE	It's too hot to scoot.
WADE	Let's go to my place.
WADE	I have a great view.
WADE	The breeze is even better.
CARRIE	I'm not the kind of girl who scoots to a guy's terrace on the first date.
WADE	I respect that.
WADE	I have central air.
CARRIE	Give me That scooter.
WADE	ever been on one?
CARRIE	no.
WADE	That's great.
CARRIE	Thank you.
CARRIE	I'm scooting in heels.
CARRIE	"You said you had a view, not the view."
CARRIE	And this breeze it's like there's different air up here.
CARRIE	How do you have all this? -
WADE	Why don't I get us some beers? Then we can talk adventures and real estate.
CARRIE	How was it possible that mild-mannered Power Lad had a classic six on the Upper East Side with a view of the park? Was he Power Lad by day and a millionaire playboy by night?
RS ADAMS	Hello?
CARRIE	You scared me.
RS ADAMS	I heard voices outside and

SAMANTHA	Just like us.
CARRIE	"Were Jenny Brier and her friends dressed like 30-something-year-olds, or were we trying to look like teenagers? One was sending Dom Perignon, another was touring on a scooter."
CARRIE	"When you're a teenager, all you want to do is buy beer."
CARRIE	"Once you hit 30, all you want to do is get carded."
CARRIE	"I wondered, in today's youth obsessed culture, are the women of my generation growing into responsible adults, or are we 34 going on 13? After a week of self-imposed seclusion, Miranda felt strong enough for solid food and table service with Lance Bloom, a senior editor at Knopf."
LANCE	"I started out wanting to be a writer, but it's a solitary life."
LANCE	I'm more interested in collaborating.

LANCE	That was a joke.
LANCE	I'm sorry.
CARRIE	He didn't want your hardware getting too close to his software.
IRANDA	It's everybody.
IRANDA	I can't open my mouth without the world thinking I'm a freak.
IRANDA	It's like I'm back in Junior High.
IRANDA	I was lucky I got out alive the first time.
CARRIE	Think of it as mouth jewelry.
CARRIE	Your tooth bracelet.
IRANDA	I'm never dating again.
CARRIE	You are.
CARRIE	If the guy's worth dating he won't care about your braces.
IRANDA	That was so After-School Special of you.
CARRIE	"In the After-School Special, you'd see him across the cafeteria."
CARRIE	"He'd smile, and he'd have braces too."
IRANDA	"But the sick thing is, I would never date a guy with braces."
IRANDA	Even now.
CARRIE	Are you kidding me? Don't you think that's childish?
RS ADAMS	"more Lemonade, Carrie?"
CARRIE	"Yes please, Mrs. Adams."
RS ADAMS	"How about some nice, homemade Toll House cookies?"
CARRIE	"Yes please, Mrs Adams."
CARRIE	"On closer inspection, living with the parents wasn't so bad."
CARRIE	It was like having servants you didn't have to pay.
RS ADAMS	"Oh, and Carrie, can you stay for dinner?"
CARRIE	"Faced with having hydraulic cylinders placed in his shaft, Trey decided to pursue the less physically demanding option of counseling with a therapist he'd found through his college alumni."
DR TALLEY	I sense you're both having difficulty verbalizing your sexual issues.
DR TALLEY	With some clients it often helps to create your own non-threatening language with which to talk about sex.
CHARLOTTE	I'm not sure that I understand.
DR TALLEY	One client rather whimsically dubbed his anus The Chocolate Starfish.
TREY	Are you sure you went to Yale?
DR TALLEY	"Charlotte, if you could rename your vagina, something non-sexual, something that didn't feel threatening to you or Trey, what would you call it?"
CHARLOTTE	Rebecca.
TREY	Rebecca? Why on earth would you
CHARLOTTE	"It sounds nice, and I've always liked the name."
CHARLOTTE	Now you name yours.
TREY	this is preposterous.
DR TALLEY	something positive.
CHARLOTTE	Trey loves to sail.
CHARLOTTE	"Don't you, Trey?"
TREY	I do love to sail.
CHARLOTTE	How about something like Canoe?
TREY	Canoe?
TREY	Canoe doesn't go with Rebecca.
CHARLOTTE	What then?
TREY	How about -Schooner.
CHARLOTTE	Schooner's good.
CHARLOTTE	Rebecca and Schooner.
CHARLOTTE	"Schooner's good, isn't it?"
DR TALLEY	It's very good.
DR TALLEY	This is a wonderful beginning.
DR TALLEY	"There's still a lot of work ahead, some here and some at home."
DR TALLEY	"Tonight, as homework, I want you to lie down together, side by side, without touching, and share a sexual fantasy."
CHARLOTTE	I'm a fairy princess in a forest.
CHARLOTTE	I'm riding on a unicorn.
CHARLOTTE	Suddenly I see a pirate in buckskins.
CHARLOTTE	A prince in disguise.
CHARLOTTE	That's when you pull me off my unicorn.
CHARLOTTE	"You tear away my gossamer petticoats, and you put your Schooner deep inside my Rebecca."
CHARLOTTE	Nowyou.
CHARLOTTE	Where are you?
TRY	I'm in hell.
TREY	"I'm sorry, Charlotte."
TREY	I can't do this.
TREY	I'm a respected surgeon.
TREY	I can't.
CHARLOTTE	"Yes, You can."
CHARLOTTE	I knowyou can.
TREY	We've dealt with this for weeks.
TREY	I'm not that sexual a person.
TREY	But we love each other and we're married now.
CHARLOTTE	Rebecca and Schooner belong together.
CHARLOTTE	They need each other.
CHARLOTTE	Please.
TREY	You are a fairy princess.
TREY	I don't deserve you.
TREY	I'm sorry.
TREY	I'm sorry.
CARRIE	"That night, Wade and l had our first sleep-over, at my place."
CARRIE	I finally figured out what made Power Lad so powerful.
CARRIE	He had the soul of a teenage boy in the body of a very grown-up man.
CARRIE	The machine will get it.
CARRIE	Hi.
CARRIE	Leave a message.
RS ADAMS	"'Hi, Carrie."
RS ADAMS	This is Mrs.
RS ADAMS	"Adams, Wade's mother."
RS ADAMS	How are you?'
WADE	"Oh, my god."
RS ADAMS	'Sorry to bother you.
RS ADAMS	'We never heard from Wade about whether he fed the dog his medicine.
RS ADAMS	"Wade's father was just about to give it to the dog, 'but if he's already had it, that would be bad."
RS ADAMS	"lf you speak to Wade, please tell him, 'l won't go to bed until I hear from him."
WADE	"Yes, Mom, I gave the dog his medicine."
WADE	"No, Mom, I'm not mad, I just I told you not to call me here."
WADE	Don't call me here.
WADE	"I love you, too."
WADE	she wants to talk to you.
CARRIE	"what? Hi, Mrs."
CARRIE	Adams.
CARRIE	"How are you? Several blocks south, Charlotte's night was interrupted too by odd noises coming from her bathroom."
CARRIE	Charlotte felt terrible.
CARRIE	She hadn't meant to make Trey cry.
CHARLOTTE	Honey?
CHARLOTTE	He said he wasn't a sexual person.
TREY	It wasn't sexual.
TREY	It was tension release.
TREY	It helps me sleep.
DR TALLEY	I understand.
DR TALLEY	"This may be difficult, Trey, but I want you to tell me specifically which magazine you were using."
DR TALLEY	"""Juggs""."
DR TALLEY	All right.
DR TALLEY	We can try and see this as a positive thing.
CHARLOTTE	How? How is this a positive thing?
DR TALLEY	Trey was masturbating to Juggs.
DR TALLEY	At least we know he isn't gay.
TREY	"Excuse me, what exactly is the problem here? It was tension release, it had nothing to do with my wife."
DR TALLEY	"Interesting choice of words, Trey."
DR TALLEY	Maybe that's the problem.
DR TALLEY	We have to find a way to integrate your wife into your sexual routine.
TREY	How are we supposed to do that?
CARRIE	Charlotte had no idea.
CARRIE	"She wished they were 13, before sex had made everything so complicated."
CARRIE	When holding hands and a kiss would have been all she needed.
IRANDA	"To pierce the corporate veil, the courts look at five factors whether the subsidiary is wholly-owned or"
CARRIE	"The 13-year-old girl inside Miranda wanted to disappear, but the 34-year-old partner in this firm decided she wasn't going anywhere."
IRANDA	You think I'm funny? You think it's hilarious that I have braces? Let's take a moment and have a good laugh.
IRANDA	Let's get it out of our systems so we can work like adults.
LAWYER	We were laughing at the typo on page three.
CARRIE	Miranda decided that TMJ was less painful than a second adolescence.
CARRIE	"The next day, she had her braces removed and resumed her life as a 34-year-old tongue-thruster."
CARRIE	Trey resumed his own brand of thrusting and discovered that tension release could be a turn-on.
CARRIE	Charlotte discovered a way to include herself in Trey's sex life.
CARRIE	And she figured out what to do with those proofs not suitable for framing.
CARRIE	The following weekend at the Brier Bar Mitzvah party I'm not sure if I have your name.
SAMANTHA	I'm not sure if I have your name.
SAMANTHA	"Let's see, Goldman, Goldstein I don't see it."
SAD GIRL	I'm sure I'm on the list.
CARRIE	I can't believe you still have actual albums.
CARRIE	"Oh my God, Styx."
CARRIE	I love Styx.
CARRIE	I had this album.
WADE	"I loved ""Renegade""."
WADE	"Hated ""Babe""."
CARRIE	how do You have this?
WADE	are You kidding? this is a classic.
CARRIE	This song is me driving my parents' Oldsmobile without them knowing.
WADE	You knowwhat Would Go with this?.
CARRIE	Roller skates?
WADE	No. Canadian super grass.
WADE	Six times stronger than pot and 400 bucks an ounce.
CARRIE	It was obvious Wade was in no hurry to save up for his own apartment.
CARRIE	and What is that?
WADE	my bong.
WADE	I made it.
WADE	at Camp Takatoka.
CARRIE	"I'm sorry, Camp Takatoka? I hadn't smoked pot out of a bong since my eighth-grade boyfriend made one out of tin foil, a BlC pen, and a bottle of Pepsi Light."
CARRIE	I didn't even know if I'd remember how.
CARRIE	Turns out it was like riding a bike a ten speed.
CARRIE	"Back at the Bar Mitzvah bash, Samantha heard some girl-talk not suitable for little ladies."
JENNY	I'm gonna fuck at least three of those NSYNC guys after the after party.
BLONDE GIRL #1	The other two are gay.
BLONDE GIRL #2	I'd fuck them and their gay boyfriends.
SAMANTHA	Aren't you a little young for that kind of talk? I'm serious.
SAMANTHA	You have your whole lives to talk that way.
SAMANTHA	"Enjoy being children, at least until you turn 15, and start having sex."
JENNY	I've given blow jobs since twelve.
SAMANTHA	Really?
BLONDE GIRL #1	It's the only way guys will like you.
SAMANTHA	That isn't true.
JENNY	"Talk to the hand, grandma."
CARRIE	Samantha had resented Jenny Brier because of everything she had.
CARRIE	"But then she realized, she'd had something that no amount of money could buy a childhood."
CARRIE	"Suddenly, the Dairy Queen wasn't looking so bad."
CARRIE	I'm thirsty.
WADE	There's bong water.
CARRIE	Bong water! Hold this.
WADE	What are you doing? That's wet.
CARRIE	Attack of the spicy chicken wings.
WADE	Shit! That looks like my parents' car.
CARRIE	"Oh, shit."
WADE	"Shit, Shit, shit."
CARRIE	It's OK.
WADE	"My parents said, if they caught me smoking pot again, I'd have to sleep in the store."
CARRIE	Wait.
WADE	What?
CARRIE	"If they see billions of chicken wings, they're gonna know we've been smoking pot."
WADE	Fuck the chicken wings.
WADE	Where did we put the fucking pot?
WADE	You're home.
WADE	Early.
RS ADAMS	Is that marijuana I smell?
CARRIE	"No, ma'am."
WADE	"God, no."
RS ADAMS	"Then what is this? We told you, if you ever brought marijuana into this house again"
WADE	Carrie brought it.
CARRIE	I couldn't believe it.
CARRIE	Power Lad would never have ratted me out.
RS ADAMS	"Is that true, Carrie? Did you bring marijuana into this house?"
CARRIE	There comes a time when you have to take responsibility for yourself.
CARRIE	"A time when l, like Jenny Brier, had to stand up and say to the world, ""Today, I am a woman."
CARRIE	""" Yes, Mrs."
CARRIE	"Adams, I brought the marijuana into the house."
CARRIE	And I'm taking it with me when I go.
SAMANTHA	"Oh, baby! There she is."
CARRIE	"In the end, I decided I was definitely 34 going on 35, but in a city like New York with its pace and pressures, sometimes it's important to have a 13-year-old moment, to remember a simpler time when the best thing in life was hanging out, Iistening to records, and having fun with friends in your own apartment."
CARRIE	"On a city where cynicism is as prevalent as pashmina, there is nothing more hopeful than getting ready for the first date."
CARRIE	Will O'Connor was a cute urban planner Miranda had met at Starbucks.
CARRIE	He mistook her latte for his double-caff and offered to make it up to her by buying her a drink that Saturday.
CARRIE	Samantha preferred the saying good night to the first date routine.
CARRIE	His name was Sebastian Wise.
CARRIE	"For Sam, it was a very good night."
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, Trey and Charlotte were practicing their new routine."
TREY	All righty.
TREY	Schooner's sails are up.
CHARLOTTE	"Yes, I can feel it."
TREY	"All righty, I'm bringing it into the harbor."
CHARLOTTE	Bring it in.
TREY	All right.
TREY	Here I come.
TREY	Here I come.
	Honey?
TREY	The wind died.
TREY	I'm sorry.
CARRIE	"After a week of the same routine, the only thing getting up in their bed was Charlotte's libido."
CARRIE	"As for me, my routine had become very routine."
CARRIE	I was spending almost every night working.
IRANDA	My date is three hours late.
IRANDA	"I'm being stood up, right?"
CARRIE	Maybe he got lost.
IRANDA	Carrie.
CARRIE	Doesn't look good.
IRANDA	And I'm wearing a new dress.
IRANDA	And I'm eating out of plastic.
CARRIE	I'm sorry.
IRANDA	The least he could do is get to know me before he rejects me.
CARRIE	"Yeah, that's illegal dumping."
IRANDA	It's crazy.
IRANDA	This hasn't happened to me since I'm 27.
IRANDA	I should know better.
IRANDA	I thought I'd got smarter about picking them now.
CARRIE	I can't believe guys still stand girls up.
IRANDA	I can't believe I'm eating a frozen dinner.
IRANDA	I'm such a cliche.
IRANDA	Do you wanna grab a drink?
CARRIE	"I can't, I have to work."
CARRIE	I agreed to teach these stupid Learning Annex classes.
CARRIE	"They're calling it ""Bright Lights Date City""."
IRANDA	I'm so embarrassed for you.
CARRIE	They're paying 300 bucks a pop.
CARRIE	It's a seminar on where to meet men.
CARRIE	"Apparently, I'm an expert."
IRANDA	Tell them to steer clear Of Starbucks.
CARRIE	who Would pay for this?
IRANDA	Now? Maybe me.
IRANDA	"OK, gotta go."
IRANDA	This dress is making a mockery of me.
CARRIE	"I'm sorry, sweetie."
CARRIE	Bye.
IRANDA	please.
IRANDA	Bye.
CARRIE	"Stood up at 27, Miranda had done nothing."
CARRIE	"At 34, she decided she wasn't going to take this stand-up lying down."
CARRIE	Will gave her the cold shoulder and his home number.
WILL'S MOTHER	Hello?
IRANDA	Hi.
IRANDA	Is Will there?
WILL'S MOTHER	"Who's speaking, please?"
IRANDA	Miranda Hobbes
WILL'S MOTHER	"Miranda, this is Will's mother."
IRANDA	"Well, Will's mother."
IRANDA	"I don't know howyou raised your son, but he just stood me up for a date."
WILL'S MOTHER	Will died today.
IRANDA	They're starting to die on us.
CHARLOTTE	"Oh, my god."
SAMANTHA	At least you weren't stood up.
IRANDA	35 and they're dying.
IRANDA	we should Give up now.
CARRIE	It explains why they don't call back.
CHARLOTTE	how did he
IRANDA	Heart attack at the gym.
CARRIE	This is why I don't work out.
IRANDA	"do You Wanna Hear the worst part? I felt So bad, I told his Mother I Would Go to the wake."
SAMANTHA	You don't even know him.
CARRIE	and she never will.
SAMANTHA	I'm far from being dead.
SAMANTHA	I got us reservations at Samba next week.
CARRIE	Fancy.
SAMANTHA	I Could Only get us a fourtop.
SAMANTHA	Do you think Trey would mind staying home?
CHARLOTTE	No. He doesn't seem up for much these days.
CARRIE	"Charlotte, is everything OK?"
CHARLOTTE	We've been trying to
SAMANTHA	Fuck?
CHARLOTTE	Whatever.
CHARLOTTE	It's just not
SAMANTHA	getting big and hard?
CARRIE	is this dirty mad libs?
CHARLOTTE	"I love him, and he's trying, but this is so frustrating."
IRANDA	Of course It is.
CHARLOTTE	"last night I got So turned on, l"
SAMANTHA	"You almost masturbated, he almost got it up you almost had sex."
IRANDA	Everybody masturbates.
SAMANTHA	I did It this morning.
CARRIE	That's why I got your voicemail.
CHARLOTTE	He masturbates and reads porn.
CHARLOTTE	"When it comes to me, nothing."
SAMANTHA	Madonna/@Whore.
CHARLOTTE	You think?
SAMANTHA	"Trey sees you as his virginal wife, not as sexual plaything."
SAMANTHA	You're not going to get anywhere until you change how he sees you.
CHARLOTTE	I don't know if I can do that.
CARRIE	"Yes, You can."
CARRIE	You're sexy.
CARRIE	He should see you.
CARRIE	You're something to see.
CARRIE	I soon realized how many desperate New York women there were.
CARRIE	I'm flattered that so many of you showed up to hear me talk.
CARRIE	"The fact is, I have had a lot of experience with men."
CARRIE	"Some of it good, some of it bad, some of it very ugly."
CARRIE	There are two million single men in this city.
CARRIE	I have dated about a million of them.
CARRIE	All these men are right outside your door.
CARRIE	"Next time you step out with your shoes and traveling cappuccino, take a look around."
CARRIE	Our metropolis is stacked with men.
CARRIE	You never knowwho you'll run into.
CARRIE	"You can turn a corner, and boom bright lights, date city."
WOMAN #1	Could you be more specific?
CARRIE	Do you mean places to meet men? Sure.
CARRIE	Let's see.
CARRIE	Samba.
CARRIE	Any sporting Sports bars Mickey Mantle's.
WOMAN #2	I've gone there.
WOMAN #2	All the men were married.
CARRIE	Really? Let's see.
CARRIE	I once met this fellow on the Hampton Jitney.
CARRIE	"It turned out he couldn't drive, and he was on a parole program."
CARRIE	That's a bad example.
CARRIE	"Suddenly, I felt like the bad example."
CARRIE	"Yes, you."
WOMAN #3	are You married?
CARRIE	no.
CARRIE	"Yes, you there."
WOMAN #4	have You ever been married?
CARRIE	"No, not that I'm aware of."
CARRIE	"Yes, you in the back."
WOMAN # 5	How old are you?
CARRIE	I'm really not an expert on men.
CARRIE	I just write about this stuff.
WOMAN #5	Then why are we paying to hear you talk about it?
WOMAN #6	Be quiet.
WOMAN #6	She's older than us.
WOMAN #6	We can learn something.
CARRIE	The only thing I learned that night was that I should have stayed home.
CARRIE	can I smoke in here?
ALL	No
CARRIE	"If you stay single long enough, you should get wiser about dating."
CARRIE	"Which men, where to meet them But what made us experts? Wasn't our single status a neon sign that we couldn't get it right? What if all these years in New York have only made us older, more confused or dead? Are we getting wiser or just older? If they'd been holding tomatoes not Louis Vuitton bags, I'd be dead."
IRANDA	Or at least gazpacho.
CARRIE	Do you know there are no free men? .
IRANDA	"We're at my date's wake, so yes"
CARRIE	they were So hostile.
IRANDA	Fuck 'em.
CARRIE	What do I know about men.

IRANDA	Thanks.
CARRIE	You were friends with Will?
IRANDA	May he rest.
JIM	Roommates in college.
JIM	"We were friends, but competitive."

CARRIE	He's kind of an asshole.
IRANDA	Really?
CARRIE	"Yes, indeedy."
IRANDA	he seems great.
CARRIE	That's what I thought when I dated him.
CARRIE	"When it wasn't working, and I broke up with him, ""Hello, asshole."

JIM	I'd love to get together with you sometime.
IRANDA	Here's my card.
IRANDA	"My e-mail address is on the back, and my cell."
CARRIE	Will's death had turned Miranda into my target audience a desperate woman.
CARRIE	"Downtown, Samantha was getting wise, Sebastian Wise, again."
CHARLOTTE	"While, uptown, Charlotte was getting nothing at all."
SAMANTHA	we almost broke the bed.
CHARLOTTE	You can't break a bed.
IRANDA	What Does this stallion do?
SAMANTHA	I'm not sure.

CARRIE	way out.
CARRIE	New Jersey out.
IRANDA	"Speaking of petty, how upset would you be if I went out with Jim?"
CARRIE	"Jim, old Boyfriend Jim?"
IRANDA	he called me.
CARRIE	"Miranda, no."
CARRIE	He needs to be voted off the island.
IRANDA	"I know how you feel, but he was so sweet on the phone."
IRANDA	It was eight years ago.
IRANDA	Maybe he's learned something.
CARRIE	Haven't you learned anything?
IRANDA	Apparently not.
IRANDA	He's alive and he asked me out.
IRANDA	I'm fragile right now.
CARRIE	"Fine, go."
IRANDA	One woman's asshole is another woman's
CARRIE	A-hole
IRANDA	As long as you're OK with it.
CARRIE	"Later that week, Charlotte decided for Trey to see the sexual part of her, she'd have to dress the part."
CHARLOTTE	I'm going to get him to notice me.
CHARLOTTE	I have to.
CARRIE	That's a bottom.
CARRIE	"If you're going to go the lingerie route, why not go a little more upscale and less flammable?"
CHARLOTTE	I don't wanna be me. I wanna be someone else.
CARRIE	That equals a healthy relationship.
CHARLOTTE	What do these say?
CARRIE	Read my lips.
CHARLOTTE	I want to be call girl meets Park Avenue.
CARRIE	Then you have to pair that with a cardigan.
CHARLOTTE	This is important to me.
CHARLOTTE	I need him to see me sexually.
CARRIE	I knowyou do.
CARRIE	I'm just not sure I need to.
CARRIE	This is much more a Samantha job.
CHARLOTTE	Please.
CHARLOTTE	I need a break from her.
CARRIE	You shouldn't be so hard on her.
CARRIE	She doesn't mean to be hurtful.
CHARLOTTE	She was.
CARRIE	There were two of you ruining my breakfast.
CHARLOTTE	I have enough problems right now.
CHARLOTTE	I don't need any lectures.
CARRIE	It was my second lecture that week that was a failure.

CLAIRE ANNE	I'll let you have this scarf if you show me where a girl can get a hard drink in a dark bar around here.
SAMANTHA	Done and done.
IRANDA	My last date died.
IRANDA	The fact that you're still breathing makes this a success.
JIM	Low standards.
JIM	I like that.
JIM	this was really nice.
IRANDA	"Yeah, It was."
IRANDA	Carrie wasn't sure that we would get along.
JIM	She knew me a long time ago.
JIM	I've changed.
JIM	"Back then, I was in a band called Uncle Ted's Ass."
JIM	and I Could sit on my hair.

IRANDA	I'd like that.
JIM	night.
IRANDA	night.
CARRIE	"The next morning, Miranda called with the post mortem on her date with Jim."
CARRIE	Hello?
IRANDA	It's me.
CARRIE	I thought it was the Learning Annex bugging me about my class.
IRANDA	When's that?
CARRIE	12th of Never Gonna Happen.
CARRIE	People asked for refunds after my first class.
IRANDA	What do they know?
CARRIE	more than I do.
CARRIE	I feel like a total sham.
IRANDA	Easy.
IRANDA	That's my friend you're talking about.
IRANDA	I went out with Jim.
CARRIE	"Don't make me say, ""l told you so."
IRANDA	""" It was great."
IRANDA	He was fun and romantic.
IRANDA	We talked till the restaurant closed.
IRANDA	You're wrong about him.
IRANDA	'This could be good.
CARRIE	Are we talking about Asshole Jim?
IRANDA	He's not an asshole.
CARRIE	not till You break up with him.
IRANDA	he says Great things about you.
CARRIE	he does?
IRANDA	I'm going out with him on Friday.
CARRIE	"Go, God's speed."
IRANDA	I feel weird dating a guy that you don't like.
IRANDA	We should all go out have a drink sometime.
IRANDA	One drink.
CARRIE	What do you know about this guy? You've been on one date.
IRANDA	What do you know? It's been eight years.
IRANDA	Think about the drink.
CARRIE	"Charlotte decided this would be a good time to spend with old friends, the sisters of Kappa Kappa Gamma."
SYDNEY	"Oh, my goodness."
SYDNEY	Has it been forever or what?
CHARLOTTE	It has.
EG	"Charlotte, we've really missed you."
CHARLOTTE	And I have missed you.
CHARLOTTE	You have no idea.
EG	Congratulations on your wedding.
EG	Welcome to the married old girls club.
STEPHANIE	He is so handsome.
STEPHANIE	"I would like to trade my husband in for him, please."
CARRIE	They would understand her.
CARRIE	"After all, they were married too."
SYDNEY	I remember being a newly-wed.
SYDNEY	We hardly ever got out of bed.
EG	Sydney.
SYDNEY	What? It's just us girls.
CHARLOTTE	My husband can't get it up.
CARRIE	It would have been wiser to have a cappuccino instead of a third drink.
CHARLOTTE	I'm so frustrated.
STEPHANIE	Charlotte?
CHARLOTTE	"Don't you ever just want to be pounded hard? Like when the bed is moving all around, and it's all sweaty, your head is knocking the headboard and you feel it might blow off? Dammit, I just really want to be fucked."
CHARLOTTE	Just really fucked.
CARRIE	The only heads blowing off were those of Kappa Kappa Grandma.
EG	this is really inappropriate.
STEPHANIE	"Yeah, we're eating."
SYDNEY	What's wrong with you? You're a
CHARLOTTE	what? What am l?
CARRIE	Charlotte realized how much they'd all changed since college. Her friends had become frenemies.

CLAIRE ANNE	Two hot broads at a hot restaurant.
CLAIRE ANNE	I love it.
SAMANTHA	The reservation is for four.
CLAIRE ANNE	Done and done.
CARRIE	Samantha couldn't believe how much fun she was having.
CARRIE	She had found a woman who was as open about her sexuality as her.
SAMANTHA	I call the blondes.
CLAIRE ANNE	You are too cute.
CLAIRE ANNE	I could just eat you up.
CLAIRE ANNE	"Yes, I could."
CLAIRE ANNE	I'm gonna eat you up.
SAMANTHA	Claire Anne?
SAMANTHA	"Oh, my god."
BLONDE GUY	Excellent.
SAMANTHA	I'm going.
CLAIRE ANNE	Wait I'll come with you.
SAMANTHA	You can forget Samba.
BLONDE GUY	where are You going?
CARRIE	Samantha learned she had a little Charlotte in her.
CARRIE	She had a line that could be crossed.
CARRIE	Hers was just more to the left.
CARRIE	"The next night, I agreed to meet Jim and Miranda for drinks."
IRANDA	Jim took me to a poetry reading last night.
JIM	The unpublished works of Robert Lowell.
IRANDA	he wrote his thesis on Lowell.
CARRIE	I didn't knowthat.
JIM	There's a lot you never knew.
JIM	Another Chardonnay for the lady.
IRANDA	Thank you.
JIM	"I lost track of you, but I always read your column."
JIM	It's really good.
CARRIE	Thank you.
CARRIE	Maybe I'd been wrong.
CARRIE	"Jim seemed kind, funny, attentive."
JIM	There's a lot of sex in there.
CARRIE	It creeps in.
JIM	You didn't knowtoo much about sex when we were dating.
CARRIE	And still an asshole.
CARRIE	good to see you.
IRANDA	Don't leave.
JIM	I was joking.
JIM	Stay.
JIM	I have really bad timing.
IRANDA	did You ever Hear his band play?
CARRIE	no.
JIM	she was busy shopping for shoes.
C	I do like my shoes.
JIM	They come in handy when you're walking all over people.
IRANDA	come on.
JIM	I'm reliving happy memories.
IRANDA	Carrie doesn't walk all over people.
JIM	she did with me.
IRANDA	Maybe that's because you're an asshole.
JIM	She's the asshole.
JIM	She never called me once after we broke up.
CARRIE	That's because you're an asshole.
JIM	She's the asshole.
IRANDA	She's not.
CARRIE	Thank you.
IRANDA	You knowwhat? Never call me again.
JIM	are You breaking up with me?
IRANDA	Yeah.
JIM	"The fancy lawyer lady is breaking up with me, like I give a shit."
CARRIE	Jim hadn't gotten older or wiser.
CARRIE	"Once dumped, he'd still dumped on everyone."
JIM	You are such assholes.
IRANDA	"oK, say it."
CARRIE	I told You so.
IRANDA	What an asshole.
CARRIE	I told You so.
CARRIE	Is it bad that it makes me feel good to say that?
IRANDA	No. I can't believe I fell for that asshole.
CARRIE	Your date died.
CARRIE	You panicked.
IRANDA	You know me too well.
CARRIE	There are plenty of other assholes out there.
IRANDA	You think?
CARRIE	I know. And I'm an expert.
IRANDA	You're such an asshole.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, uptown, the Samantha in Charlotte was ready to come out."
TRY	What in God's name are you wearing?
CHARLOTTE	It's supposed to be sexy.
TREY	"Come on, you're my wife."
TREY	That's not you.
TREY	Take it off.
CHARLOTTE	Fine.
CHARLOTTE	Look at me.
CHARLOTTE	This is me.
CHARLOTTE	"I'm not a madonna, and I'm not a whore."
CHARLOTTE	I'm your wife.
CHARLOTTE	I'm sexual and I love you.
TREY	What are you doing?
CHARLOTTE	I'm touching myself.
TREY	I can I can see that.
CHARLOTTE	Good.
CHARLOTTE	Trey?
TREY	I think we have a stiff breeze.
CARRIE	"That night, Trey successfully screwed his wife for a full minute and a half before the wind died."
CARRIE	"After Charlotte's night of love, she called the one person she knew who would appreciate it the most."
SAMANTHA	Hello?.
CHARLOTTE	He fucked me
SAMANTHA	"Honey, that's great."
SAMANTHA	I knew you could do it.
CHARLOTTE	Thanks.
SAMANTHA	Don't forget Samba Friday night.
CHARLOTTE	I'll be there.
SAMANTHA	Did you come?
CARRIE	"Having spent time with their frenemies, they forgot they were enemies and went back to being friends."
CARRIE	I realized I had become my own worst frenemy.
CARRIE	I had let 300 desperate women and one asshole convince me that I didn't know anything.
CARRIE	I did.
CARRIE	I was older and wiser.
CARRIE	I decided to keep my second date with the Learning Annex.
CARRIE	"Unfortunately, my reputation had preceded me."
CARRIE	Is this it? I'm Carrie Bradshaw.
CARRIE	You've paid good money to find out how to meet men.
CARRIE	"I don't know a lot about it, but you're not going to meet them in a Learning Annex class."
CARRIE	"So, grab your bags."
CARRIE	"Come on, we're not getting any younger."
CARRIE	That's right.
CARRIE	Just trying to give you your money's worth.
CARRIE	"I took them to a bar, took my $300 and bought them drinks."
CARRIE	"Anne, the guy over there is checking you out."
CARRIE	Twelve o'clock.
CARRIE	"Not everybody, just Anne."
CARRIE	Go and Ask Him for a light.
ANNE	I'm already lit.
CARRIE	Go.
ANNE	"Hi, got a light?"
GUY	Sure.
CARRIE	"Oh, yeah."
CARRIE	"See? OK, one down, five to go."
LIZ	What about him?
GUY #2	It's cool with me.
GUY #2	It's fine.
CARRIE	"Excuse me? Hi, have you met Liz? She works in TV."
GUY #2	I love TV.
CARRIE	something in common.
CARRIE	"That night, I made three matches."
CARRIE	I didn't look for myself.
CARRIE	I try not to date while at work.
CARRIE	"The old and wise adage is true those who can't do, teach."
CARRIE	"Those who can't teach, do."
CARRIE	Here's a live one.
CARRIE	"Go, get him, tiger."
CARRIE	Go.
CARRIE	Run like the wind.
TREY	"Here goes, Charles."
CARRIE	"Two months into her marriage, Charlotte's life seemed to be a bed of roses."
CARRIE	That's what it looked like to an onlooker.
BUNNY	My boys have been playing each other since prep school.
BUNNY	They're still not tired of it.
PATTY	Let the girls play.
CHARLES	She's wearing pastels.
CHARLES	It's whites only.
TREY	We can make an exception this one time.
BUNNY	Your father would roll over in his grave if he heard you.
PATTY	Charlotte hasn't been issued a copy of the MacDougal house rules.
CHARLOTTE	"No, but it's time I got one."
PATTY	"It's next to the Bible, on your bed stand."
BUNNY	Funny.
BUNNY	Tradition is a very undervalued virtue.
BUNNY	Marrying a MacDougal is marrying history.
CHARLOTTE	Yes.
CHARLOTTE	I guess I better go change.
CARRIE	Charlotte had no interest in hearing any more about the family history.
CARRIE	Her history with Trey was depressing enough.
CARRIE	"After a few half-baked attempts at a sex life, Trey seemed to give up."
CARRIE	The only place he even tried to score was on the tennis court.
GARDNER	good morning.
CHARLOTTE	morning.
CHARLOTTE	Beautiful roses.
GARDNER	Thank you.
CHARLOTTE	I don't knowwhat it is.
CHARLOTTE	I'm strangely drawn to him.
SAMANTHA	You knowthe man can plough.
CHARLOTTE	he had the most intoxicating scent.
CHARLOTTE	"Like sweat mixed with something, something sweet yet pungent."
CARRIE	Manure?
CHARLOTTE	"and these full, sensuous lips."
IRANDA	Does he water plants in Manhattan?
CHARLOTTE	I can't be looking at gardeners.
SAMANTHA	"Why be in the suburbs, if you're not gonna fuck a gardener?"
CHARLOTTE	He was so tanned and muscular.
CHARLOTTE	The sweat ran down from his chest onto his perfectly defined stomach.
CARRIE	"You read Harlequin Romances in school, haunts you forever."
IRANDA	"Whatever you do, don't look up."
CARRIE	"Oh, my God, did you see the way she looked at me?"
CHARLOTTE	Did you see the look her friend shot us?
CARRIE	"Contempt, like I was Pol Pot."
IRANDA	He's dead.
CARRIE	she wishes I was.
SAMANTHA	who Does she think she is?
CARRIE	Big's wife.
CARRIE	That was awful.
CARRIE	I can't believe that there is a person in New York who could hate me that much.
CARRIE	"Oh, God."
CARRIE	I was so devastated by Natasha's withering look that I decided my only recourse was to go shopping.
CARRIE	"I took a wrong turn looking for the right shoes, and south of Houston Street I literally lost my direction."
CARRIE	"Excuse me, I knowthis sounds ridiculous."
CARRIE	Can you tell me which way is West Broadway?
UGGING MAN	Give me your bag.
CARRIE	what?
UGGING MAN	Your bag.
CARRIE	It's a baguette.
UGGING MAN	let me have it.
CARRIE	I couldn't believe it.
CARRIE	"and when the city was getting safe, I got mugged."
CARRIE	is this for real?
UGGING MAN	your Watch and your ring.
CARRIE	Jesus.
CARRIE	This won't
UGGING MAN	come on.
UGGING MAN	and your Manolo Blahniks.
CARRIE	what? no.
UGGING MAN	Give me your Blahniks.
CARRIE	They weren't just after money.
CARRIE	They were after fashion.
CARRIE	"Please, sir, they're my favorite pair."
CARRIE	I got them half price at a sample sale.
UGGING MAN	Thanks.
CARRIE	"Somebody stop him, he took my strappy sandals."
CARRIE	Somebody Gross! I've been robbed! I've been robbed.
CARRIE	"He said, ""Give me your Blahniks"", which I thought was a joke."
CARRIE	Then I'm barefoot on a sidewalk in the middle of summer.
DETECTIVE STEVENS	"Anything other than the watch, the bag, the ring, and the shoes?"
CARRIE	My dignity.
IRANDA	"God, are You All right?"
CARRIE	I'm fine.
CARRIE	Thanks for coming.
IRANDA	I can't believe he took your shoes.
CARRIE	I know.
CARRIE	probably got trichinosis.
IRANDA	You Only get That from pork.
CARRIE	I'm sure I stepped on a piece of it somewhere.
CARRIE	"Detective Stevens, this is my friend, my lawyer, Miranda Hobbes."
DETECTIVE STEVENS	Nice to meet you.
IRANDA	Any chance of catching this guy?
DETECTIVE STEVENS	We hope so.
DETECTIVE STEVENS	Maybe you can come with me and read him his Miranda rights.
DETECTIVE STEVENS	"Sorry, That was lame."
IRANDA	It was funny.
IRANDA	A little cop humor.
DETECTIVE STEVENS	are You lrish?
IRANDA	no.
IRANDA	Why?
DETECTIVE STEVENS	You have beautiful red hair.
IRANDA	Anybody can be lrish with the right colorist.
DETECTIVE STEVENS	Very funny.
DETECTIVE STEVENS	"A sense of humor, I like that in a lawyer."
DETECTIVE STEVENS	It's very rare.
DETECTIVE STEVENS	I'll get back to you as soon as I have something.
DETECTIVE STEVENS	can I have your card?
IRANDA	Sure.
DETECTIVE STEVENS	Just in case.
IRANDA	Sure.
DETECTIVE STEVENS	Thanks.
CARRIE	I can't wear these.
DETECTIVE STEVENS	I'll call you.
CARRIE	I don't understand.
CARRIE	"I get mugged, and you get him? I guess that's my karma."
IRANDA	He said he'll call.
IRANDA	It doesn't mean he will.
CARRIE	What are you talking about? The man was smitten with you.
IRANDA	He probably wants free legal advice.
IRANDA	That's generally my karma.
CARRIE	Samantha discovered that her number had been passed around as well.
BRIAN	This is a message for Sam Jones.
BRIAN	"If you're getting this, it's Brian."
BRIAN	I'll see you tomorrow around 10:00.
BRIAN	Can't wait.
BRIAN	Later.
ROB	"Sam, are you there? This is Rob, Mike's friend."
ROB	"You don't know me, but I'll be there tomorrowwith some party favorites."
ALE VOICE #1	"Hello, Sam?"
SAMANTHA	"Yes, this is Sam."
ALE VOICE #1	Sam Jones?
SAMANTHA	Yes. Who is this? .
ALE VOICE #1	The Sam Jones who's having the big party tomorrow night?
SAMANTHA	"Exactly who is this Sam Jones? And where is this fabulous party? The next evening,"
CARRIE	Miranda had a date with my detective
IRANDA	I'm having an anxiety attack.
IRANDA	The most gorgeous man I've met is in my living room.
IRANDA	I can't figure out what to wear.
CARRIE	Breathe.
CARRIE	"Shut your eyes, and go with your first instinct."
IRANDA	I've been in here for 20 minutes.
IRANDA	By now he thinks I'm a freak.
IRANDA	I'll be right there.
CARRIE	What are you so worked up about?
IRANDA	He's too good-looking for me.
IRANDA	I don't have outfits that go with Hunk.
CARRIE	Wait.
CARRIE	Maybe this is karma.
CARRIE	You're getting what you deserve.
IRANDA	Right.
IRANDA	"Maybe after years of odd men, the universe is throwing me a bone."
CARRIE	"If you're lucky, a boner as well."
IRANDA	"oK, I can do this."
CARRIE	now Go and have fun.
CARRIE	"Tell Detective Stevens, if he sees a woman wearing pink suede Blahnik sandals, bring her in for questioning."
CARRIE	"While I ascribed thoughts of karma to fortune cookie psychology, I wondered, does a string of bad dates equal one good one? And will treating someone badly in one relationship ensure that you'll be treated badly in the next? Does everything that goes around come around? If so, will it come around to bite you in the ass? Is there such a thing as relationship karma? Later, I accompanied Samantha to a party thrown by Sam Jones."
CARRIE	I can't believe we're going to the party of a total stranger.
SAMANTHA	"It's not a total stranger, we do share the same name."
SAMANTHA	Why are you walking so slow?
CARRIE	I keep waiting for someone to jump out and steal my bra.
SAMANTHA	"If the guy's a loser, I'll tell him to stop having his friends call me, and we'll go for dinner."
SAMANTHA	"If not, who knows? His friend sounded cute."
CARRIE	how can You Tell over the phone?
SAMANTHA	I can.
SAMANTHA	"Besides, Washington Square very money address."
SAMANTHA	I feel like there's some cosmic purpose to all this.
SAMANTHA	It's too much of a coincidence.
CARRIE	What was the cosmic purpose of my getting snubbed by Natasha?
SAMANTHA	"If I told you I had information about Big and Natasha, would you consider it cosmic or a random act of gossip?"
CARRIE	I'd have to hear it first.
SAMANTHA	Natasha left Big.
SAMANTHA	It's over.
SAMANTHA	She's back working for Ralph Lauren.
CARRIE	"Oh, my God."
CARRIE	Who told you that?
SAMANTHA	a little bird I fucked at Ralph Lauren.
CARRIE	You waited 15 blocks to tell me that?.
SAMANTHA	I wanted you to have fun
CARRIE	I can't believe I'm responsible for breaking up their marriage.
SAMANTHA	You're not.
SAMANTHA	It probably wouldn't have worked anyway.
CARRIE	I don't think I could feel any worse.
SAMANTHA	here we are.
SAMANTHA	It's a dorm.
CARRIE	"look at That, I feel worse."
SAMANTHA	Do you think these cute boys are still in college?
CARRIE	Yes.
SAMANTHA	"I'm going to find Sam Jones, and then we're outta here."
SAMANTHA	Excuse me.
SAMANTHA	Could you tell me where I can find Sam Jones?
SAMANTHA	Sam Jones?
SAM JONES	Yeah.
SAM JONES	Who are you?
SAMANTHA	Sam Jones.
SAM JONES	Excuse me?
SAMANTHA	It appears that we have a problem here.
SAMANTHA	"We have the same name, and I'm getting all your fucking calls."
SAM JONES	"If you're getting all my ""fucking"" calls, that explains why I'm still a virgin."
CARRIE	"Samantha wondered what message the universe was sending her, but Miranda had no doubt."
IRANDA	"This was fun, and I would invite you in, but you've been in, and I have a huge day tomorrow, which isn't to say I wouldn't like to see you again."
DETECTIVE STEVENS	"I would, if you'd like I'll call you."
CARRIE	She felt like she had just hit the cosmic jackpot.
CARRIE	Please don't tell anyone we were here.
SAMANTHA	Some of those boys were cute.
CARRIE	some Of them were young enough
SAMANTHA	Don't you dare say it.
AN	"Excuse me, ladies."
AN	"Excuse me, mom."
CARRIE	"Cab! Natasha fell down the stairs, now I fall down the stairs."
CARRIE	This is an open and shut case of karmic retribution.
SAMANTHA	It was an accident.
CARRIE	this was not an accident.
CARRIE	"Yesterday, I get mugged, now I can't even get a taxi and I can always get a taxi."
CARRIE	My karma is shot.
SAMANTHA	"If everything happens for a reason, why am I getting calls for Sam Jones? What's the karmic connection? I only know about my own karma."
SAMANTHA	What's the karmic connection?
CARRIE	I Only know about my own karma.
SAMANTHA	Maybe I should fuck that virgin and give him the great first-time experience that I never had.
CARRIE	"That's not karma, that's statutory rape."
CARRIE	"Here, here."
CARRIE	Come on.
CARRIE	"What's up? Across town, Charlotte was getting a message of her own."
TREY	Wake up.
TREY	You had a nightmare.
TREY	You're all wet.
CARRIE	"Later that week, my knee still hurting from my trip down the stairs, I decided to take matters into my own hands."
ASSISTANT	"Ralph Lauren, Natasha's desk."
CARRIE	"I'd like to speak to Natasha, please."
CARRIE	It's Carrie Bradshaw calling.
ASSISTANT	What's this regarding?
CARRIE	It's personal.
ASSISTANT	Hold.
CARRIE	I didn't know howto tell an assistant it was of cosmic significance.
ASSISTANT	She's in a meeting.
CARRIE	I'll hold.
ASSISTANT	"I don't mean to be rude, but you'll be holding forever."
CARRIE	"OK then, I'll hold forever."
CARRIE	This wasn't gonna be easy.
CARRIE	I had tough karma to overcome.
CARRIE	"The next week, Charlotte flirted with her own karma."
CHARLOTTE	Where did you get such a green thumb?
GARDNER	Runs in the family.
GARDNER	We're gardeners for three generations.
CHARLOTTE	What a wonderful tradition.
CHARLOTTE	"I'm Charlotte, by the way."
CHARLOTTE	Trey's wife.
GARDNER	I know.
GARDNER	I'm Burt.
CHARLOTTE	These roses are so beautiful.
CHARLOTTE	What kind are they?
GARDNER	A special hybrid of American Beauty.
GARDNER	They're very fragrant.
CARRIE	Charlotte's karma flirted back in a most unexpected way.
CARRIE	Samantha was working out some karmic issues of her own.
SAM JONES	I came over to apologize for all those calls.
SAMANTHA	Thank you.
SAMANTHA	Anything else?
SAM JONES	I've been waiting for a woman like you my whole life.
SAM JONES	You are the hottest thing I've ever seen.
SAMANTHA	Slow down.
SAM JONES	"Oh, Lord."
SAM JONES	"Oh, my Lord! Here we go."
SAM JONES	That was awesome.
SAMANTHA	"Yes, it was."
SAM JONES	Sam?
SAMANTHA	"Yes, Sam?"
SAM JONES	I think I love you.
SAMANTHA	"Honey, that wasn't love."
SAMANTHA	That was sex.
SAM JONES	"No, ma'am."
SAM JONES	I I love you.
SAMANTHA	Time to move.
SAM JONES	do I have to?
SAMANTHA	"Oh, yes. I've got stuff to do."
SAM JONES	Goodbye to the sweetest lips I've ever kissed.
SAMANTHA	Bye-bye.
CARRIE	"Later, the MacDougals were enjoying their cocktail hour, which generally lasted from 5:00pm to last man standing."
TREY	I beat You Three sets in a row.
CHARLS	We didn't finish.
CHARLES	It was getting dark as You recall.
BUNNY	Stop bickering.
	"Sandwiches, ma'am?"
BUNNY	no.
BUNNY	"No, thank you."
PATTY	I certainly had an interesting day.
PATTY	I went riding.
PATTY	"In the afternoon, I took a walk around the property and saw Charlotte kissing the gardener."
BUNNY	"Charlotte, you're a MacDougal now."
CARRIE	Samantha found that the universe had sent her many messages.
ACHINE	You have 35 new messages.
SAM JONES	It's Sam Jones.
SAM JONES	Call me.
SAM JONES	I can't stop thinking about you.
SAM JONES	I have to see you tonight.
SAM JONES	It's really important.
SAM JONES	"Sam, it's Sam."
SAM JONES	"I don't think I can live without you, OK? Are you there, babe? I have to see you tonight."
SAM JONES	It's really important.
SAM JONES	"OK, Sam."
SAM JONES	It's Sam.
CARRIE	"Across town, Miranda met her karmic treasure for dinner."
IRANDA	"After ten years, I made partner two months ago."
IRANDA	Or was it three? I'm losing track.
DETECTIVE STEVENS	Congratulations.
IRANDA	Thank you.
WAITRESS	can I get You another drink?
IRANDA	"double vodka martini, please."
WAITRESS	"and You, sir?"
DETECTIVE STEVENS	I'm fine.
WAITRESS	Would You care to order?
DETECTIVE STEVENS	Could we have a minute?
WAITRESS	Take your time.
DETECTIVE STEVENS	I thought about law school.
DETECTIVE STEVENS	I loved Columbo so much as a kid
CARRIE	Miranda realized that every woman was staring at her date.
DETECTIVE STEVENS	Your friend is the typical case that I see on the job.
DETECTIVE STEVENS	It's not as exciting as you might think.
DETECTIVE STEVENS	It's not homicide
CARRIE	She knewwhat they were thinking why is that attractive man with her?
DETECTIVE STEVENS	"If your friend hadn't lost her shoes, I wouldn't be here."
WAITRESS	There you go.
IRANDA	Thank you.
CARRIE	She drank to feel better about herself.
CARRIE	"Six vodka martinis later, she was feeling pretty damn good."
IRANDA	You're hot.
DETECTIVE STEVENS	And you're a little drunk.
IRANDA	I'm fine.
IRANDA	I'm great.
IRANDA	"Hot, hot, hot."
IRANDA	You may be the most beautiful man that I've ever been with.
DETECTIVE STEVENS	You're not bad yourself.
IRANDA	"I'm no Mena Suvari, but I'm great in bed."
CARRIE	"When Trey didn't come to bed, Charlotte went looking for him."
CHARLOTTE	What are You doing out here?
TREY	lmproving my serve.
CHARLOTTE	Stop.
CHARLOTTE	"You're upset, and what I did was so wrong."
CHARLOTTE	I'm sorry.
TREY	"What can I say? I'm unable to meet your needs, so from time to time, as much as I detest it, I'll have to look the other way."
CHARLOTTE	I don't want a husband who looks the other way.
CHARLOTTE	I want a husband who makes me not want to kiss the gardener.
TREY	No marriage is perfect.
TREY	So much of what we have is wonderful.
TREY	We can have separate lives and still be together.
TREY	It's totally acceptable.
CARRIE	"As Charlotte looked at her perfect husband at their family's perfect country house, she realized the one thing that was missing was that perfect connection with an imperfect person."
CHARLOTTE	"When we get back to the city, I think we should separate for a while."
TREY	All righty.
CARRIE	"Seven unreturned phone calls, and still no response from Natasha."
CARRIE	Buddhists believe you pay for what you do wrong in this life in the next.
CARRIE	I knewwhat I'd done.
CARRIE	I just didn't think I could wait a lifetime to be forgiven.
CARRIE	"The next morning, Miranda woke up with the worst hangover of her life."
IRANDA	Detective Stevens?
CARRIE	"On her hall table, she discovered that Detective Stevens had left a number for her local AA chapter."
CARRIE	Samantha got her karmic retribution.
SAM JONES	"I love you, Sam Jones."
CARRIE	"In screwing Sam Jones, she wound up screwing herself."
SAM JONES	"I love you, Sam Jones."
CARRIE	"A few days later, Charlotte came home to her old apartment."
CARRIE	"It was good fortune that she had only sublet it, not to mention good sense."
CARRIE	"Not wanting to come back in my next life as a dung beetle, I asked Samantha's assistant to pump Natasha's assistant to find out where she was having lunch."
CARRIE	I need to talk to you.
NATASHA	I'm gonna scream.
CARRIE	I'm only gonna stay a minute.
CARRIE	"I tried to call you at work, but Anyway, it's not important."
CARRIE	Can I have a sip of this? Thanks.
CARRIE	I heard about your marriage.
CARRIE	It's just so terrible.
CARRIE	I never meant for any of this to happen.
CARRIE	"If there was something I could do to take it away, I would."
CARRIE	But I can't.
CARRIE	I came here today because I needed to say how sorry I am.
CARRIE	I am deeply sorry for what I did to you.
CARRIE	It was wrong.
CARRIE	I'm sorry.
NATASHA	Are you through?
CARRIE	Yes. Thank you for listening.
NATASHA	Wait.
NATASHA	"I'm sorry, too."
CARRIE	You are?
NATASHA	Yes. I'm sorry about it all.
NATASHA	I'm sorry he moved to Paris and fell in love with me.
NATASHA	I'm sorry that we ever got married.
NATASHA	"I'm sorry he cheated on me with you, and I'm sorry that I pretended to ignore it for as long as I did."
NATASHA	"I'm sorry I found you in my apartment, fell down the stairs and broke my tooth."
NATASHA	I'm very sorry that after much painful dental surgery this tooth is still a different color than this tooth.
NATASHA	"Finally, I'm sorry that you felt the need to come down here."
NATASHA	"Not only have you ruined my marriage, you've ruined my lunch."
NATASHA	That's just what I had to say.
CARRIE	I was just leaving.
CARRIE	My actions had set into motion a karmic chain of events that put Natasha back on the singles market.
CARRIE	As if single women didn't have it hard enough.
CARRIE	"Somewhere out there, Big was alone again."
CARRIE	"The universe may not always play fair, but at least it's got a hell of a sense of humor."
CARRIE	"What? In life, there are all sorts of wake-up calls."
CARRIE	But crowing on East 73rd Street was one I was not prepared for.
CARRIE	It was my own fault.
CARRIE	"I'd let my frenzy for a rent-controlled apartment near Barneys, override the fact that it was animal-hospital adjacent."
CARRIE	That's the thing about New York you never know what's around the corner.
CARRIE	"Or, in Samantha's case, just outside your window."
CARRIE	There they were Samantha's neighborhood transsexual hookers.
CARRIE	"Half man, half woman, totally annoying."
DESTINY	"Girl, she got herself a handful with that one!"
CHYNA	He was all up in my stuff once.
DESTINY	I told him to get that thing out of my ass or I'll shit on it.
SAMANTHA	"""Get that out my ass, or I'll shit on it."""
SAMANTHA	Is that the dirtiest thing you've ever heard?
CARRIE	Let's hope so!
SAMANTHA	I am paying to live in a neighborhood that's trendy by day and tranny by night.
CHARLOTTE	Tranny?
SAMANTHA	Transsexuals.
SAMANTHA	Chicks with dicks.
SAMANTHA	"Boobs on top, balls down below."
IRANDA	I don't get the appeal there.
CARRIE	It's the other white meat.
SAMANTHA	"I understand that pseudo-straight men have to get laid, but not on my block."
CARRIE	I thought my chickens were bad.
SAMANTHA	Every morning at 4:00am they start.
SAMANTHA	It's like they're putting on a show.
IRANDA	"The ""Up-my-ass Players""."
IRANDA	Too early for tranny talk?
CHARLOTTE	It's so weird to be sitting here eating omelet again Iike nothing ever happened.
CARRIE	"It was our first Saturday morning breakfast since Charlotte had left Trey, her husband of three months."
CHARLOTTE	I was married.
CHARLOTTE	"And now, what? I'm single again?"
CARRIE	"Sweetie, you're not single you're just separated."
CHARLOTTE	That's right.
CHARLOTTE	I'll never be single again I'll be divorced.
CHARLOTTE	The only thing worse than being 34 and single is being 34 and divorced.
CARRIE	Thanks.
IRANDA	I think it's worse to be 34 and trapped in a marriage that doesn't work.
CHARLOTTE	did I try Hard enough?
SAMANTHA	"""Hard"" being the operative word."
CARRIE	"Sweetie, Trey has an impotence problem"
CHARLOTTE	I am so sick of talking about Trey.
CHARLOTTE	I think and talk about Trey all the time.
CHARLOTTE	"Change the subject, please."
CHARLOTTE	"Talk about the ""up my ass"" stuff."
IRANDA	"OK, here's the plan."
IRANDA	"Sunday, we all come over, have an unpacking party and no Trey-talk."
SAMANTHA	I'll bring the cocktails.
CARRIE	I'll bring the food.
CARRIE	How about roof-chicken? Can I help you? I live around the corner and my window Iooks over the roof with the chickens and the crowing
ANIMAL NURSE	Roosters.
CARRIE	Excuse me?
ANIMAL NURSE	They are roosters.
ANIMAL NURSE	Roosters crow.
CARRIE	"Yes, they do."
CARRIE	And very loudly.
ANIMAL NURSE	Sorry.
ANIMAL NURSE	We just got them.
ANIMAL NURSE	Rescued from a cockfight in the Bronx.
CARRIE	my god.
ANIMAL NURSE	I'll move them to the basement.
CARRIE	You don't have to do that.
CARRIE	They had all that fight-trauma.
CARRIE	They need fresh air.
CARRIE	I don't want them to be miserable.
ANIMAL NURSE	Don't worry.
ANIMAL NURSE	They have a very lovely life.
CARRIE	That's all right.
CARRIE	I'll get over it.
CARRIE	Thank you for being so nice.
CARRIE	Just gonna take one of these for my friend.
CARRIE	She has a cat.
IRANDA	Are you hungry? Yeah? I'm hungry too.
WORKER	Shanghai Garden.
WORKER	May I help you?
IRANDA	I'd like to order some take-out.
WORKER	"address, please."
IRANDA	331 West 78th Street.
IRANDA	Apartment 4F.
IRANDA	I'd like to order some chicken with broccoli in a brown
WORKER	Brown sauce with brown rice.
WORKER	Cold noodles.
WORKER	I know.
WORKER	Every night the same.
IRANDA	Right.
IRANDA	The Chinese take-out lady thinks I'm pathetic.
IRANDA	"She said, ""Every night, the same thing."
CARRIE	""" That's a tad bitchy for a take-out lady."
IRANDA	Do you think I'm in a rut?
IRANDA	"A food-rut? I'm sitting home with my cat, ordering the same thing almost every night."
IRANDA	The only thing sadder would be a Cathy Comic on my refrigerator.
CARRIE	Never say Cathy Comic to me again.
IRANDA	She giggled at me.
IRANDA	The take-out lady.
CARRIE	Order from someplace else.
IRANDA	There's This place is my favorite.
IRANDA	It's easier than figuring out where else to go.
CARRIE	Then bear the take-out food shame.
CARRIE	There they were.
CARRIE	Our ex-boyfriends.
CARRIE	What are they doing together? Are they friends now?
IRANDA	Apparently.
IRANDA	This is bad.
CARRIE	What do you think they are talking about? Their dogs?
IRANDA	"Yeah, here's their conversation: ""How's your dog? Good, yours? Was that the bitches who ruined our lives?"" They didn't see us."
IRANDA	We have a choice.
IRANDA	We can run the other way or move in here.
CARRIE	We can't run.
CARRIE	These shoe-straps will break.
CARRIE	how do I look?
IRANDA	Good.
IRANDA	Great!
CARRIE	You look great too.
IRANDA	Thank God I didn't wear my drawstring pants.
STEVE	Look who it is!
CARRIE	Another thing about New York who knows who is around the corner?
STEVE	This is what I like about New York.
STEVE	Street-traffic.
AIDAN	"Well, look at you."
CARRIE	"Look who it is, Pete."
CARRIE	My God! Look how big he got.
STEVE	He starts college next year.
IRANDA	You must be very proud.
CARRIE	Two beers at a time.
CARRIE	Did we give you guys a drinking problem? They are not just for us.
JESSICA	I'll have nightmares about that ladies room for weeks.
STEVE	"Carrie and Miranda, this is Jessica and Susan."
CARRIE AND MIRANDA	Hello.
SUSAN	"Honey, do you still wanna see the movie or just crash?"
STEVE	I don't care.
CARRIE	we have to go.
IRANDA	"Yeah, we gotta go."
CARRIE	"It was good to see you, Aidan."
CARRIE	"Come on, this way."
CARRIE	That night at Charlotte's light unpacking and heavy realisations.
CARRIE	"Well, they're over us."
CARRIE	It's just so hilarious.
IRANDA	I'm hemorrhaging inside.
CARRIE	We thought they were pining and they have new girlfriends already!
SAMANTHA	were they cute?
CARRIE	the point is not if they were cute.
CARRIE	"The point is, they were there."
IRANDA	they were cute.
CARRIE	very cute.
IRANDA	"How can they have new relationships? I'm still in the ""l just broke up with someone"" phase."
CHARLOTTE	It's infuriating.
CHARLOTTE	Women sit around obsessing about what went wrong.
CHARLOTTE	"Men just say ""all righty"" and move on."
SAMANTHA	I take offence at that.
SAMANTHA	Not all women sit around and obsess about men.
SAMANTHA	"As soon as my relationships are over, I move on."
IRANDA	Relationships?
SAMANTHA	"You know, dates."
CARRIE	I do try to figure out what went wrong.
CARRIE	But I don't think that I obsess.
IRANDA	You are Miss Obsess.
CARRIE	Big? Big was tricky.
CARRIE	I still don't know what happened.
SAMANTHA	You should have a relationship rear-view mirror.
IRANDA	Relationships may appear closer than they actually are.
CARRIE	I didn't obsess about Aidan.
CARRIE	Aidan was clear.
CARRIE	He moved on.
CHARLOTTE	It's much easier for men to move on.
SAMANTHA	is it?
IRANDA	Please! The ratio of women to men in this city is huge.
IRANDA	"They can sit outside, have a beer and wait for the Jessicas and Susans to come to them."
CARRIE	Maybe we only obsess over relationships that feel unfinished.
CHARLOTTE	"I can guarantee that Trey isn't sitting around with his friends, obsessing about what went wrong."
SAMANTHA	Men never think anything is their fault.
CHARLOTTE	I wish there were no men.
SAMANTHA	"Call someone, she's gone insane."
CHARLOTTE	"If there were no men, then we wouldn't feel hurt."
CHARLOTTE	And we wouldn't be disappointed.
CHARLOTTE	And we wouldn't be spending our night obsessing about them.
CHARLOTTE	I'm so over men.
CHARLOTTE	What? I am.
CARRIE	"Later that night I got to thinking about men, women and relationships."
CARRIE	"Or more to the point, how women feel men disappoint them in relationships."
CARRIE	"Then a radical, earth-shattering thought popped into my head."
CARRIE	"What if everything isn't the man's fault? After a certain age and a certain number of relationships, if it still isn't working and the ex's seem to be moving on and we don't, perhaps the problem isn't the last boyfriend, or the one before him or even the one before him."
CARRIE	"Could it be that the problem isn't them, but horror of horrors, is it us? Downtown, the ""Up-my-ass Players"" were in the middle of their late night repertory."
CARRIE	"""Much Ado About Up My Ass"" and ""Long Day's Journey Up My Ass""."
CARRIE	"Samantha decided if she was gonna get a good night's sleep, she'd have to test how effective a PR professional she was."
SAMANTHA	"Ladies, hello."
SAMANTHA	"I live right up there, the loft within earshot."
SAMANTHA	"As much as I respect a woman's right for a little something something with certain New Jersey gentlemen, I have a request."
SAMANTHA	I have a very early business meeting.
SAMANTHA	"And I think we all know, there are certain dark circles even the best make-up can't cover."
SAMANTHA	Am I right?
DESTINY	"Sorry to wake you, baby."
DESTINY	We'll take it down here.
SAMANTHA	I appreciate it.
SAMANTHA	"By the way, I'm Samantha."
DESTINY	Destiny.
CHYNA	Chyna.
JO	Jo.
CHYNA	"No ""e""."
CHYNA	"She got the ""e"" cut off."
DESTINY	"Those heels are fierce, Miss Girl."
SAMANTHA	Don't I know it.
CARRIE	"Samantha knew how to get her way with men, even if they were half women."
CARRIE	What?
BIG	Rough night?
CARRIE	who is this?
BIG	It's me.
CARRIE	I didn't recognize your voice.
CARRIE	You sounded different.
BIG	Did I wake you? It's only 11 :30.
CARRIE	"No, I was up late working."
CARRIE	And there are these chickens that crow on the roof next door.
BIG	Roosters.
BIG	Roosters crow.
CARRIE	"The ""Fun On The Farm"" fact everyone's aware of but me."
BIG	"So Tell me, is Red a mistake?"
CARRIE	in What way?
BIG	I'm repainting my bedroom.
CARRIE	a Red bedroom?
BIG	Just one wall.
BIG	But I think it's too red.
BIG	It's like sleeping in communist China.
BIG	She left. We ended it.
CARRIE	I heard.
BIG	You did? How?
CARRIE	I think it was on the news.
BIG	Could we have lunch sometime? I really need to talk to you.
BIG	Please?
CARRIE	Where?
BIG	"Boathouse restaurant, Central Park."
BIG	How about Saturday at 2:00?
BIG	Carrie?
CARRIE	I'm nodding.
BIG	So I'll see you at 2:00 then.
CARRIE	Bye.
CARRIE	"Later that day, I met Miranda at my favorite thrift store, to dig for buried treasure."
CARRIE	"Do you think I can get away with a ""Hang in there, baby"" halter top?"
IRANDA	"Nobody gets away with a ""Hang in there, baby"" halter top."
IRANDA	Do you wanna go to the Hopper exhibit Saturday afternoon?
CARRIE	I can't.
CARRIE	I have to work.
CARRIE	I lied.
CARRIE	I don't have to work.
CARRIE	I'm meeting Big for lunch and I didn't think you'd approve.
IRANDA	You're meeting Big?
CARRIE	he called.
CARRIE	he sounded upset and needs to talk.
IRANDA	Since when Does big talk?
CARRIE	What does that mean? He's upset about Natasha leaving
IRANDA	I'm not holding your hand through this again.
CARRIE	I'm not asking you to hold anything.
CARRIE	We're just having lunch.
IRANDA	It's a huge mistake.
CARRIE	"It's not a huge mistake, it's lunch."
IRANDA	How many more times are you gonna go through this? He is bad for you.
IRANDA	"Every time you get near him you turn into this pathetic, needy victim."
IRANDA	What pisses me off is that you are more than willing to go back for more.
CARRIE	I am not going back for more and I can't even believe I can't believe you would say that to me.
IRANDA	if You start up with big again
CARRIE	I am not starting up with big again.
IRANDA	"If you do, I don't wanna know anything about it."
IRANDA	No calls.
IRANDA	No crying.
CARRIE	Are you gonna cut me out of your life like you did to Steve?
IRANDA	What?
CARRIE	The first sign of any little weakness and you just write people off.
CARRIE	"My God, Miranda."
CARRIE	You are so judgmental.
CARRIE	"You can say I'm pathetic and needy and I can't say anything to you? Everybody is not as tough as you, Miranda."
CARRIE	People Some of us make mistakes.
CARRIE	That's just perfect.
CARRIE	Walk away.
CARRIE	It's all my fault.
CARRIE	"Right there, next to the two for $5 bin, Miranda and I had our first big fight."
ANSWERING MACHINE	You have no messages.
CARRIE	"I thought by the time I got home, she'd have left an apology."
CARRIE	"I was gonna call her, but wasn't quite sure what to say."
CARRIE	Or whose fault it really was.
CARRIE	"And at the exact same moment across town, Miranda was preparing to make the call she'd been dreading all day."
WORKER	Shanghai Garden.
WORKER	May I help you?
IRANDA	I'd like to order some takeout.
WORKER	"Address, please."
IRANDA	I'd like some
WORKER	"Chicken with broccoli, brown sauce, brown rice and cold noodles, right?'"
IRANDA	You know what? I don't need this.
IRANDA	Never mind.
WORKER	OK.
WORKER	Bye-bye.
CARRIE	"After she hung up, Miranda couldn't get the giggle out of her head."
CARRIE	She decided to walk the two blocks to confront the woman with the judgmental giggle who thought she was better than her.
WORKER	Shanghai Garden.
WORKER	May I help you? OK.
WORKER	"Address, please."
CARRIE	Miranda realized the giggle wasn't about her.
CARRIE	It wasn't about anything.
CARRIE	It wasn't the noodles that kept her coming back to this restaurant.
CARRIE	It was the fact that this was their place and it was filled with happy memories.
STEVE	Twice in one week.
STEVE	Am I lucky or what?
IRANDA	I thought I got custody Of this place.
STEVE	I like Their hot and sour soup.
IRANDA	Are you here by yourself?
STEVE	Me too.
STEVE	Sit down.
STEVE	I've got this bowl of crunchies that I'll never get through.
STEVE	How are you?
IRANDA	Not good.
IRANDA	Carrie and I had a huge fight.
STEVE	About what?
IRANDA	"Me, her, you, Big Me."
IRANDA	My judgmental stuff.
IRANDA	How bad was it?
STEVE	It wasn't good.
IRANDA	I didn't throw you away.
IRANDA	Did l?
STEVE	no.
IRANDA	she said I did.
STEVE	"Miranda, only you and I really know what happened between you and l."
STEVE	It's nobody else's business.
STEVE	"But she said that, huh? Must've been pretty mad."
IRANDA	I didn't say nice things to her either.
IRANDA	I just don't want her to get hurt again.
STEVE	So you yelled at her?
IRANDA	Yeah.
STEVE	Sounds about par.
IRANDA	I guess your new girlfriend doesn't yell.
STEVE	No.
IRANDA	How's that going?
STEVE	It's OK.
WORKER	like to order?
IRANDA	I'd like the chicken with broccoli
IRANDA	Let me see the menu.
IRANDA	I should try something new.
STEVE	You should.
STEVE	Go ahead.
STEVE	Live a little.
IRANDA	There is so much.
DUDE	You're so fucking hot.
SAMANTHA	I can't believe they go away for one night and then back three in a row.
DUDE	Forget them.
DUDE	Look at me.
SAMANTHA	I'm sorry.
SAMANTHA	I'm here.
SAMANTHA	Where are those cops? I called them half an hour ago.
DUDE	Look at me.
DUDE	Let's bring it on home.
SAMANTHA	I can't.
DUDE	I'm close.
SAMANTHA	"Well, I'm not."
CARRIE	The idea that she'd miss a night's sleep pissed Samantha off.
CARRIE	"The idea that she'd miss an orgasm, was more than she could bear."
SAMANTHA	"Shut up, you bitches! I've called the cops."
DESTINY	Suck my cock!
SAMANTHA	Keep talking and I'll come down there and cut it off for you.
DESTINY	"I'd like to see you try, motherfucker."
CHYNA	You think we want that BS? No way!
DUDE	Are you gonna pull a Lorena Bobbit?
SAMANTHA	"$7,000 a month and I have to put up with a trilogy of fucking trannies? I don't fucking think so! I am a taxpayer and member of the Women's Business Association."
SAMANTHA	I don't have to put up with this shit!
DUDE	forget them and come back to bed.
CARRIE	There was nothing anyone could do to stop her.
CARRIE	Samantha was obsessed.
CARRIE	"She had a date with Destiny, Chyna and Jo, no ""e""."
SAMANTHA	"Take this, ladies!"
DESTINY	"I'm gonna come up there and kick your ass, bitch! Get off my hair now!"
COPS	"Move it along, girls."
SAMANTHA	"You heard the man, move it along."
SAMANTHA	"Hey, where are you going?"
DUDE	Home.
DUDE	You freak me out.
CARRIE	"And Uptown, Charlotte was a bit freaked out as well."
CARRIE	"Unable to sleep and unable to unpack, she was with the only man she could tolerate"
CARRIE	the Dalai Lama.
TREY	Charlotte? It's me.
CHARLOTTE	Trey? What are you doing here? It's 4:00am.
TREY	I saw your light on from the street.
TREY	I figured you'd still be up.
CHARLOTTE	What do you want?
TREY	"Ever since you left, I can't stop thinking about you."
CHARLOTTE	"Honey, we're separated."
TREY	I know.
CARRIE	"Once Charlotte swore off men, this man couldn't get enough of her."
CARRIE	"He wasn't a rooster and it wasn't the Bronx but from deep inside, Trey's cock began to crow."
CARRIE	"Across town, I was still wide awake."
CARRIE	I couldn't get my fight with Miranda out of my head.
CARRIE	"I was not only capable of obsessing about relationships with men, I was capable of obsessing about relationships with women."
ANSWERING MACHINE	East Side Animal Shelter.
ANSWERING MACHINE	Please leave a message.
CARRIE	This is your neighbor who complained about the chickens.
CARRIE	I can't take it any more.
CARRIE	Move them in.
CARRIE	Thanks.
CARRIE	"I figured if they had a lovely life, I was entitled to the same thing."
TREY	Well All righty.
TREY	I knew that was in me somewhere.
CHARLOTTE	You did?
TREY	I just hadn't felt it since before
CHARLOTTE	Why did you stop yourself? Before what?
TREY	Since before we got engaged.
CHARLOTTE	Oh.
TREY	Yeah.
TREY	Oh.
CHARLOTTE	Do you think our whole problem had to do with the fact that
TREY	What? Say it.
CHARLOTTE	You didn't really wanna marry me.
TREY	no.
TREY	I think it may be due to the fact that I didn't want to get married at all.
CHARLOTTE	then Why did you?
TREY	I Guess I thought It was time.
TREY	"I'm of a certain age, people expect you to get married."
CHARLOTTE	"Yes, well That sounds familiar."
TREY	one other thing
CHARLOTTE	what?
TREY	I married you because I knew I'd never find anyone as wonderful as you to marry.
CARRIE	"He may have gone away, the pre-op transsexual, but he came back, loaded with eggs."
DESTINY	"Now who's laughing, bitch?"
CARRIE	Samantha knew this was one relationship with a man she couldn't walk away from.
CARRIE	Because this man was half woman.
CARRIE	"Good, you're there."
IRANDA	I was Just gonna call you.
CARRIE	Do you really think I'm pathetic?
IRANDA	"No, I'm so sorry."
IRANDA	I don't think you're pathetic at all.
CARRIE	"I'm outside the restaurant, hiding in some bushes."
CARRIE	Do you still not think I'm pathetic? '
CARRIE	l know you think it's a huge mistake.
CARRIE	It's just something I feel I need to do to move on.
IRANDA	Don't listen to me.
IRANDA	I have no idea what's right for you and Big.
CARRIE	"But if I'm wrong and it is a mistake, I need to know you'll be there for me."
IRANDA	I'm there.
CARRIE	I'm going in.
CARRIE	Any last minute advice?
IRANDA	Don't let him kiss you.
IRANDA	That seems to be where you get into trouble.
IRANDA	'Carrie?'
CARRIE	I'm nodding.
CARRIE	"Hello, you."
BIG	"Hello, you."
BIG	It's good to see you.
BIG	Are you OK?
CARRIE	My hair is in a duck pond.
CARRIE	My Dior purse.
BIG	I'll get it.
CARRIE	"Oh, my God! What is that?"
BIG	how was your shower?
CARRIE	I No longer smell Of pond.
CARRIE	Exactly how many terry-cloth robes do you have?
BIG	Three Or four.
CARRIE	"Oh, Three Or four."
CARRIE	I swore I would never be in this room with you again.
BIG	You said to take you to the nearest shower.
CARRIE	That is one red wall.
BIG	"Yes, it's red."
BIG	I gotta ask you a question.
BIG	was It All my fault?
CARRIE	no.
CARRIE	It wasn't all your fault.
BIG	We really screwed that up.
BIG	What were we thinking?
CARRIE	I have no idea.
BIG	Fuck.
BIG	I was counting on you for answers.
BIG	"how are You doing, kid?"
CARRIE	pretty Good.
CARRIE	How are you doing?
BIG	Good.
BIG	Aside from the fact I feel like I've been through a war.
CARRIE	"Really, we're like war buddies."
CARRIE	War buddies in Calvin Klein robes.
BIG	"I hate to admit this, but I kind of like living alone again."
CARRIE	Why doesn't that surprise me?
CARRIE	I should go.
BIG	Don't you want to stay a while?
CARRIE	I can't.
BIG	Why?
CARRIE	"Because, sweet friend, you and I are like that red wall."
CARRIE	It's a good idea in theory.
CARRIE	"But somehow, it doesn't quite work."
CARRIE	"And just like that, I realized Big and I weren't ""us"" any more."
CARRIE	We had become something else.
CARRIE	"What it was, I had no idea."
ANSWERING MACHINE	You have one new message.
IRANDA	It's me.
IRANDA	I'm wondering how it went.
IRANDA	Call me when you get home.
CARRIE	"I had no idea where the chickens had gone, but I hoped it wasn't the Bronx."
CARRIE	And I hoped they were happy.
SAMANTHA	Who wants a wiener?
DESTINY	"Girl, I'm trying to get rid of one."
CARRIE	"The next Saturday, Samantha decided to throw a kiss and make up party for the ""Up-my-ass Players""."
CHARLOTTE	Trey called me three times last week.
CHARLOTTE	He's dying to get back together.
CHARLOTTE	But I don't know.
CHARLOTTE	Is that wise?
CHARLOTTE	"I'm obsessing again, aren't l?"
CARRIE	a bit.
SAMANTHA	"So, what are we all drinking?"
CARRIE	"""Flirtinis."""
CARRIE	"Vodka, pineapple and champagne."
CARRIE	Flirtinis.
IRANDA	Destiny made them.
SAMANTHA	I'm past a Flirtini.
SAMANTHA	"I need a ""Fucktini""."

CHYNA	Give me the shake.
CHYNA	Don't mind the weight.
CHYNA	Eat something.
CARRIE	"Don't worry, they have a very lovely life."
CARRIE	If you're single there's one thing you should always have when you go out on a Saturday night.
CARRIE	Your friends.
CARRIE	Why are we walking so fast?
SAMANTHA	Are we in that big a hurry to get to an engagement party?
CHARLOTTE	"What, don't you guys want to go?"
IRANDA	"I did, until I saw this invitation."
CARRIE	Let me see that again.
CARRIE	"""Two souls, one thought."
CARRIE	""" That is sappy."
CARRIE	That is totally not like Danny.
IRANDA	Must've been her idea.
IRANDA	"Two souls, one pushy fiancÃ©e."
CHARLOTTE	"Come on, it's beautiful."
CHARLOTTE	"It's a big, romantic gesture to express how they feel about each other."
CARRIE	If two people have only one thought between them something is very wrong.
CARRIE	Cab.
SAMANTHA	I remember when Danny had more than one thought and they all involved going up my ass.
CHARLOTTE	You had sex with Danny?
SAMANTHA	"He's cute, straight, and we've know him for 10 years."
SAMANTHA	Haven't we all had sex with Danny?
CARRIE	"Yeah, That one weekend That I was bored."
CHARLOTTE	Just a New Year's Eve kiss.
IRANDA	I showed him a boob in a coat-check room.
CARRIE	Just one?
IRANDA	I sensed he couldn't commit.
IRANDA	We're over here.
IRANDA	Baby lamb chops.
CARRIE	This is quite a spread.
IRANDA	"Two souls, one big budget."
CARRIE	"There he was, the fiancÃ© du jour."
DANNY	"Hey, look who's here!"
"CARRIE, MIRANDA"	Congratulations!
DANNY	Thanks.
DANNY	"and this is my other half, Hailey."
"CARRIE, MIRANDA"	Congratulations.
DANNY	"Hailey, this is Carrie and Charlotte."
"CARRIE, MIRANDA"	Miranda.
DANNY	"Oh, Miranda."
DANNY	Right.
DANNY	Sorry.
DANNY	I'm just a little overwhelmed.
IRANDA	Couldn't remember my name?
CARRIE	Maybe you should've showed him both boobs.
CARRIE	And across the room from the two-soul couple
PHIL	I told the other numb-nuts I wanted a Grey Goose an hour ago.
PHIL	"Chop, chop."
CARRIE	a man with no soul.
SAMANTHA	"So, Phil, what is it that you do?"
PHIL	"I'm a TV agent, and I fucking love it."
JILL	What a beautiful wedding ring.
CHARLOTTE	Where's your husband? He's not here.
CHARLOTTE	We're actually taking some time apart.
CHARLOTTE	We're separated.
CHARLOTTE	"Not legally separated, nothing legal."
CHARLOTTE	"God, no."
CHARLOTTE	We're just taking some time to figure things out.
CHARLOTTE	We got married really fast.
CHARLOTTE	Love at first sight.
CHARLOTTE	Didn't think it through.
CHARLOTTE	"So now we're talking and trying to figure out what he actually we, he and I, really want."
CHARLOTTE	"We love each other so much but that doesn't always mean a marriage is working, does it? It does not."
CHARLOTTE	We had some problems in the bedroom.
CHARLOTTE	But it was more about the fact that we got married so fast.
CHARLOTTE	So now we're just talking and trying to figure things out.
CHARLOTTE	"Just talking, nothing physical."
CHARLOTTE	I think it's better if we just talk.
CHARLOTTE	So we are talking till we figure it all out.
CHARLOTTE	"So no, he's not here."
JILL	Okay.
JILL	I have to Don't talk to her.
CARRIE	Charlotte realized that she and Trey were two souls with too many thoughts.
HAILEY	The minute we met it was perfect.
HAILEY	I knew we were meant to be together.
HAILEY	"I could stop looking, I had found him."
"CARRIE, MIRANDA"	Congratulations!
HAILEY	And what about you guys?
CARRIE	I'm not dating anyone.
HAILEY	"What about you, Miranda?"
HAILEY	Seeing anyone special?
IRANDA	"Actually, no."
IRANDA	But I am seeing a whole bunch of unspecial guys.
IRANDA	That's one of the requirements to date me.
IRANDA	"""Are you special? Sorry, move along."
IRANDA	"""But if you have any unspecial friends, could you give them my number?"" I'm serious."
IRANDA	Do any of you have a totally unremarkable friend or maybe a house plant I could go to dinner with on Saturday night?
HAILEY	She's hilarious.
CARRIE	"Hey, what the hell was going on in there? Felt like your comedy routine should have a two-drink minimum."
IRANDA	We were standing in a group of married or engaged women.
IRANDA	Just trying to avoid the pity party.
CARRIE	and I thought It was a cocktail party.
IRANDA	We were the only single people in there.
CARRIE	"Miranda, we're the only single people anywhere."
IRANDA	"Are you telling me you didn't see all those ""Don't worry, you'll find someone"" looks?"
CARRIE	"Nope, didn't see them."
IRANDA	Society views single people our age as sad and pathetic.
IRANDA	I don't need that judgment hanging over me.
IRANDA	I Go on the offensive and make them laugh.
CARRIE	"Okay, Shecky."
CARRIE	You know what? Sometimes I think people in couples wish they had our lives.
IRANDA	Nope.
IRANDA	"We make them uncomfortable, and they don't know what to say."
CARRIE	And you're sure you're not overreacting?
IRANDA	Yeah.
TREY	Coming.
TREY	God.
TREY	Yes.
CHARLOTTE	What are we doing? Goodnight.
CHARLOTTE	Charlotte.
TREY	I thought it was the horsemen of the apocalypse.
CHARLOTTE	I cannot go to any more parties until I know what we're going to do.
TREY	about what?
CHARLOTTE	"Us! I've been awake, wondering if we should stay together in spite of issues."
CHARLOTTE	"I don't want to confuse you, so I made some notes."
TREY	You made some notes?
CHARLOTTE	It helps me to be clear.
CHARLOTTE	"One, sex life."
TREY	"The sex we had on the floor of your apartment was quite good, actually."
CHARLOTTE	One time.
CHARLOTTE	That does not a marriage make.
TREY	Come inside.
TREY	Maybe we can rack up a new score.
CHARLOTTE	"Two, you only want me when you can't have me."
TREY	Did you make a note that mentions how beautiful you look tonight?
CHARLOTTE	We have some big decisions to make.
CHARLOTTE	Trey You have a boner.
TREY	You are just so beautiful.
CHARLOTTE	I can't discuss my notes if you have a boner.
TREY	come inside.
CHARLOTTE	"I cannot come inside, we are separated."
CHARLOTTE	I have more notes.
TREY	I think about you every night.
TREY	May I take off your panties?
CHARLOTTE	Don't.
TREY	All Right.
CHARLOTTE	You said you didn't want to be married.
CHARLOTTE	But now I don't know if I want to be married.
CHARLOTTE	"Trey, are you"
CARRIE	"That night, neither Charlotte nor Trey came inside."
TREY	I'm not quite sure what to say.
TREY	"I'm sorry, Charlotte, may I get you a hankie?"
CHARLOTTE	It's too late for a hankie.
CHARLOTTE	This isn't working.
CHARLOTTE	"Whatever this is we're doing, it isn't working."
CHARLOTTE	Just please stop calling me.
CHARLOTTE	I'll call you when I've figured out what I want.
TREY	"Charlotte, I love you."
TREY	Send me the dry cleaning bill.
CARRIE	"Trey may have had a lot of flaws, but bad manners wasn't one of them."
CARRIE	"It was a lovely, uneventful Saturday morning."
CARRIE	"Three lattes, two newspapers, and one dating-service application."
IRANDA	"""Dear single"" Single? You don't even have a name?"
CARRIE	"I'm single, I don't deserve one."
SAMANTHA	That's the postal equivalent of a drive-by shooting.
CARRIE	I thought those 57 menus I get every day from Hunan Moonan were annoying.
IRANDA	Look at this.
IRANDA	"""Don't let your soul mate slip away."
CARRIE	""" It's almost a threat."
CARRIE	"It's like, ""We have him."
CARRIE	He's just waiting for you.
CARRIE	"""But hurry, 'cause he's slipping away."
CARRIE	There he goes.
IRANDA	""" Soul mates only exist in the Hallmark aisle in Duane Reade drugs."
CHARLOTTE	I disagree.
CARRIE	I believe there's that one perfect person out there to complete you.
IRANDA	"And if you don't find him? What, you're incomplete? It's so dangerous."
CARRIE	"All right, first of all, the idea that there's only one out there why don't I just shoot myself right now? I'd like to think people have more than one soul mate."
SAMANTHA	"I agree, I've had hundreds."
CARRIE	"And if you miss one, along comes another, like cabs."
CHARLOTTE	That is not how it works.
CARRIE	Okay.
IRANDA	But you're still looking outside yourself.
IRANDA	It's saying that you're not enough.
CHARLOTTE	are You enough?
CARRIE	"Actually, today she's too much."
SAMANTHA	The bad thing about the one perfect soul mate is that it's so unattainable.
SAMANTHA	You're being set up to fail.
IRANDA	"Exactly, and you feel bad about yourself."
SAMANTHA	It makes the gap between the Holy Grail and the assholes even bigger.
CHARLOTTE	I don't care.
CHARLOTTE	I believe in soul mates.
CHARLOTTE	I thought Trey was mine.
CHARLOTTE	But I don't think that a soul mate would on your leg.
CARRIE	Really true.
CHARLOTTE	There's got to be that someone out there who's just perfect for me.
CHARLOTTE	Maybe I should keep looking.
CARRIE	Here you go.
IRANDA	"Okay, we're filling this out."
CHARLOTTE	I'm not in the mood.
IRANDA	"Not for you, for her."
CHARLOTTE	Okay!
CARRIE	no.
"MIRANDA, SAMANTHA"	Yes.
IRANDA	"""Age."
IRANDA	Check box.
IRANDA	"""20 to 25, 25 to 30, 30 to 34."
CHARLOTTE	""" Not after next week."
CHARLOTTE	Birthday girl.
SAMANTHA	"""35 to 44."
SAMANTHA	""" Honey, welcome to my box."
CARRIE	Soul mate.
CARRIE	"Two little words, one big concept."
CARRIE	"A belief that someone, somewhere is holding the key to your heart, and your dream house."
CARRIE	All you have to do is find them.
CARRIE	"So where is this person? And if you loved someone and it didn't work out does that mean they weren't your soul mate? Were they just a runner-up contestant in this game show called ""Happily Ever After""? And as you move from age box to age box and the contestants get fewer and fewer are your chances of finding your soul mate less and less? Soul mates, reality or torture device?"
SAMANTHA	"What about a little birthday dinner? II Cantinori, something nice."
CARRIE	I'm not sure I want to do anything.
CARRIE	I'm kind of into laying low.
SAMANTHA	Laying low Or Feeling Low?
CARRIE	"No, I'm fine."
SAMANTHA	"Come on, you've got to do better than that."
SAMANTHA	"You've got to grab 35 by the balls and say, ""World, I'm 35!"""
CARRIE	"Okay, calm down, Auntie Mame."
SAMANTHA	I'll put the dinner together.
SAMANTHA	All you have to do is show up.
SAMANTHA	"Just close friends, very fabulous-lite."
CARRIE	All right.
CARRIE	"That sounds fun, thank you."
SAMANTHA	Should I invite Big?
CARRIE	"What, are you slowly trying to kill me on the way to lunch?"
SAMANTHA	"Technically you are friends now, right?"
CARRIE	"You know, a phone call here and there."
CARRIE	It's friendly.
CARRIE	do You think I should I invite him?
SAMANTHA	"How should I know? When I'm done with them, I'm done with them."
CARRIE	Maybe not.
CARRIE	And I think he's still in London.
SAMANTHA	Let's just keep it to low-maintenance friends.
CARRIE	All right.
FRIAR	Welcome.
FRIAR	Come in.
SAMANTHA	He is hot.
CARRIE	he is a priest.
SAMANTHA	he is a hot priest.
SAMANTHA	Look at his robe.
SAMANTHA	"It's so ""Robin and his merry men."
FRIAR	""" EstÃ¡ bien, gracias."
SAMANTHA	"You tell them, Friar Fuck."
CARRIE	"Okay, sister, let's go."
CARRIE	I'm not gonna lose my table at Pastis so you can cruise a holy man.
CARRIE	"What street are we on, again? That Sunday, Samantha went to church."
SAMANTHA	good morning.
FRIAR	good morning.
SAMANTHA	I noticed all the good work you're doing in the neighborhood and I just stopped to see if I could be of service.
FRIAR	We could use another hand in the kitchen.
SAMANTHA	I'm in public relations.
SAMANTHA	And I was thinking maybe I could help put a benefit together.
SAMANTHA	"Something classy, respectful."
SAMANTHA	I can guarantee Donald Trump and Marlo Thomas.
FRIAR	"Thank you, but here at All Souls, we're a little more low-key than that."
FRIAR	"We're more about collecting food, canned goods to feed to the needy."
SAMANTHA	So I love your robe.
FRIAR	This is what we wear.
FRIAR	I'm in the Franciscan order founded by St.
FRIAR	Francis.
FRIAR	The robe is Do you really want to hear about this?
SAMANTHA	Tell me more about this St. Francis.
FRIAR	He lived his life based on the vows of poverty and chastity.
FRIAR	Here.
FRIAR	It's St.
FRIAR	Francis giving his coat to the poor.
SAMANTHA	"Samantha Jones, public relations."
SAMANTHA	If you change your mind about the benefit or anything.
CARRIE	"And just like that, Samantha went from Mr."
CARRIE	No Soul to Mr.
CARRIE	All Souls.
CARRIE	"After church, most people go out for pancakes."
CARRIE	Samantha wasn't most people.
CHARLOTTE	"Samantha, your face is glowing."
CHARLOTTE	Did you get a facial or something?
SAMANTHA	I masturbated all afternoon.
CARRIE	"All Right, then."
IRANDA	Seriously? All afternoon?
SAMANTHA	"two, two and a half hours."
IRANDA	Who's got that kind of time? I like to get in and get out.
SAMANTHA	"I enjoy a quickie every now and then but when it's good like today, I go with it."
SAMANTHA	I masturbated to my priest.
CHARLOTTE	your priest?
SAMANTHA	Friar Fuck.
CARRIE	I think we might have to get her a crash helmet.
CHARLOTTE	You have a priest?
CARRIE	no.
CARRIE	"She wants him, but she can't have him."
CARRIE	It's all very Thorn Birds.
SAMANTHA	"In my fantasy he tears the food I'm carrying for the homeless out of my arms, rips open my dress lays me down in the street and enters me."
IRANDA	What do you do for the next 2 hours and 20 minutes?
CHARLOTTE	"Stop, You are talking about a priest."
SAMANTHA	It's a fantasy.
SAMANTHA	I can masturbate to whomever I like.
SAMANTHA	It's imagination.
SAMANTHA	It's fun and perfectly healthy.
SAMANTHA	Who do you all fantasize about?
"CARRIE, MIRANDA"	Russell Crowe.
CARRIE	Jinx! You owe me a coke.
IRANDA	That's amazing.
IRANDA	What did women do before Russell Crowe?
"CARRIE, SAMANTHA"	George Clooney.
CARRIE	Clooney's like a Chanel suit.
CARRIE	He'll always be in style.
IRANDA	I used to masturbate to a busboy who was rude to me once.
IRANDA	What do you think that means?
IRANDA	"Fine, the cheese stands alone."
SAMANTHA	"Come on, Charlotte."
SAMANTHA	"Get that judgmental puss off, and join in."
SAMANTHA	Who do you fantasize about?
CHARLOTTE	"No, it's private."
IRANDA	"Come on, it can't be any worse than a priest and a busboy."
SAMANTHA	We're not moving on till you tell us about one of your masturbation guys.
CHARLOTTE	It's not guys.
CHARLOTTE	"Lately, it's just one man."
CARRIE	L.
CARRIE	L.
CARRIE	Bean?
CHARLOTTE	No. Trey.
CHARLOTTE	"And we have this really, you know, perfect sex."
CHARLOTTE	What do you think it means?
BIG	This is 459-1905.
BIG	"I'm not in, so please leave a message."
CARRIE	"I think you're still in England but it's midnight here in New York, and it's my birthday."
CARRIE	I am officially old.
CARRIE	So I felt the need to call someone older.
CARRIE	"Anyway, some friends are giving me a dinner tomorrow night."
CARRIE	"Actually it's tonight, and you're a friend."
CARRIE	"So if you are back in town it's going to be at II Cantinori, at 8:30 p."
CARRIE	m.
CARRIE	"And if you're still in London then cheerio, old chap."
CARRIE	"So, okay."
CARRIE	"The next day, on Wall Street"
SHEILA	"Miranda? Sheila, hi!"
IRANDA	How are you?
SHEILA	I'm fantastic! Gosh! Joe and I just got back from New Orleans.
SHELIA	So how are you? Are you seeing anyone special?
CARRIE	But Miranda wasn't feeling very Shecky.
IRANDA	"Actually, I'm not."
SHELIA	"Look, he's out there for you somewhere."
SHEILA	"You just haven't met him yet, right?"
IRANDA	"Maybe, maybe not."
IRANDA	I don't know if I believe all that.
IRANDA	Maybe there isn't someone for everyone.
CARRIE	There it was.
CARRIE	The truth.
CARRIE	"No Hallmark hope, no two-drink minimum."
IRANDA	So how is Joe? You've been married for how many years?
SHEILA	Five.
IRANDA	Wow.
SHEILA	"I bet you're thinking, ""Where are the kids?"" Right? It's like I said to Joe."
SHEILA	We can have kids or we can have gorgeous fabric without chocolate stains.
CARRIE	Miranda realized it's not just about being single.
CARRIE	Everyone has a sore spot that needs a little comedy routine.
SHEILA	let alone a poopy diaper.
CARRIE	And so Miranda laughed.
CARRIE	Not because it was particularly funny but because it was kind.
SAMANTHA	They told me you were inside.
SAMANTHA	Am I disturbing you? May I join you? I was thinking about you yesterday.
SAMANTHA	You and the work that you do.
SAMANTHA	I was at the market.
SAMANTHA	They're Le Sueur peas.
SAMANTHA	They're the best.
FRIAR	That's very kind.
FRIAR	Thank you.
SAMANTHA	I have a confession to make.
SAMANTHA	I think about you other places than the market.
SAMANTHA	Do you ever think about me?
FRIAR	I believe that God made the body.
FRIAR	And it's perfect in its splendor.
FRIAR	But I'm not of my body.
FRIAR	My life is about other joys.
CARRIE	Samantha wondered if maybe the hot monk was her soul mate as he was certainly unattainable.
CARRIE	I arrived at my party after a day of shopping.
CARRIE	With no true soul mate I spent the afternoon with my shoe soul mate Manolo Blahnik.
HOSTESS	"good evening, can I help you?"
CARRIE	"Yes, Bradshaw, party of 10."
HOSTESS	You're the first to arrive.
HOSTESS	"Follow me, please."
CARRIE	It's 8:45 p.m.
CARRIE	The reservation was for 8:30 p.m.
CARRIE	", right?"
HOSTESS	That's right.
HOSTESS	Here you go.
HOSTESS	Enjoy.
CARRIE	Thank you.
WAITER	Hi.
CARRIE	Hi.
WAITER	Would you like a drink whilst waiting?
CARRIE	"I'll have a Shirley Temple, please."
CARRIE	"Once everyone else gets here, we'll be drinking a lot of champagne."
WAITER	"Good, great, excellent."
CARRIE	"Twenty minutes later, still no party."
CARRIE	Hi.
CARRIE	Still alone.
CARRIE	Did anyone call asking for Bradshaw?
HOSTESS	Not that I'm aware of.
HOSTESS	Let me check with the maitre d'.
CARRIE	"Okay, thanks."
WAITER	Can I bring you some champagne now?
CARRIE	Not yet.
WAITER	"Good, great, excellent."
GROUP	"Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Marta Happy birthday to you"
CUTE HIP GIRL	"25? Fuck, I'm old!"
CARRIE	Hi.
CARRIE	Sorry for holding the table.
CARRIE	I can't imagine where everybody is.
CARRIE	"There is only one II Cantinori, right?"
HOSTESS	Yes.
CARRIE	Okay.
HOSTESS	The woman with the birthday cake is here and she needs to be paid.
CARRIE	Okay.
CARRIE	I'll just get my purse.
CARRIE	After I paid $70 for my own birthday cake I was totally out of the party mood.
CARRIE	So I decided to go home and kill myself.
CONSTRUCTION WORKER 	"Lady, What are You doing?"
CONSTRUCTION WORKER 	Get off of there! Look where you're standing!
CONSTRUCTION WORKER 	"It's wet, get the hell off there! No, the other way!"
CONSTRUCTION WORKER 	"The other way, for Chrissakes!"
CONSTRUCTION WORKER 	For crying out loud.
CONSTRUCTION WORKER 	Jesus Christ! Don't pick up the cake!
CONSTRUCTION WORKER 	She's picking it up!
CARRIE	I'm sorry!
CONSTRUCTION WORKER 	"Marilyn Monroe, do me a fucking favor, get off the road!"
CARRIE	I'm sorry! Sorry!
CONSTRUCTION WORKER 	"We'll bring some beer over, and we'll have"
CARRIE	I'm sorry! God!
CARRIE	By the time I got home I had fallen into an emotional hole so deep only a fireman without a collarbone could rescue me.
ANSWERING MACHINE	You have 14 messages.
SAMANTHA	"Honey, I'm trapped at work, I'll be 10 minutes late."
SAMANTHA	"The reservation line is busy, I'll see you soon."
CHARLOTTE	"Carrie, I'm in traffic."
CHARLOTTE	They're paving Fifth Avenue.
CHARLOTTE	"No one can get through, don't wait for me."
CHARLOTTE	Happy birthday.
IRANDA	I'm stuck in fucking traffic.
IRANDA	I don't know how to spell II Cantinori for the idiot at 411.
IRANDA	Get a cell phone!
STANFORD	"Carrie, it's Stanford."
STANFORD	I'm at the wrong place.
STANFORD	Did you know there's a Mexican restaurant on University and 11th called El Cantinoro?
CHARLOTTE	Carrie.
IRANDA	"Okay, I'm here."
IRANDA	They said you just left.
IRANDA	Where are you? We're still here.
SAMANTHA	"Okay, so now we're coming uptown."
SAMANTHA	Meet you at the coffee shop in 20 minutes.
ANSWERING MACHINE	End of messages.
CHARLOTTE	"Carrie? It's just me! It's just me, Charlotte!"
CARRIE	I just aged 35 more years.
CARRIE	What are you doing here?
CHARLOTTE	"I'm sorry, I came to take you to the coffee shop."
CARRIE	No.
CARRIE	I'm going to bed.
CARRIE	I'm not in the mood to be with a bunch of people.
CHARLOTTE	"Come on, it's just the four of us."
CHARLOTTE	"You have to come, it's your birthday."
CARRIE	I'm aware of that.
CARRIE	"The longer I sat there, the more alone I felt."
CARRIE	And it really hit me.
CARRIE	I am 35 and alone.
IRANDA	You are not alone.
CARRIE	"I know I have you guys, but And really, I hate myself a little for saying this, but it felt really sad not to have a man in my life who cares about me."
CARRIE	No special guy to wish me happy birthday.
CARRIE	No goddamn soul mate.
CARRIE	And I don't even know if I believe in soul mates.
CHARLOTTE	"Don't laugh at me, but maybe we could be each other's soul mates."
CHARLOTTE	"And then we could let men be just these great, nice guys to have fun with."
SAMANTHA	That sounds like a plan.
CARRIE	I'm 35.
CARRIE	35 is not 25.
IRANDA	Thank God.
CARRIE	I'm 35.
SAMANTHA	"Shut the fuck up, I'm 140."
BIG	"Happy birthday, baby."
BIG	Get in.
CARRIE	"It's after 12:00, you're late."
BIG	"Not really, I'm on London time."
CARRIE	London is five hours ahead.
BIG	"In that case, I'm really fucking late."
CARRIE	I can't believe you actually got out of the car and got balloons.
BIG	"I didn't, Raoul did."
BIG	Good man.
BIG	So how old are you?
CARRIE	how old are you?
BIG	Nope.
CARRIE	You don't have to give me an exact number.
CARRIE	"Pick a box. 30-35, 35-40, 40-45?"
CARRIE	Really?
BIG	I don't know what you're referring to.
BIG	I had something in my eye.
CARRIE	How do you feel about soul mates?
BIG	"Well I like the word ""soul."" I like the word ""mate."
BIG	""" Other than that, you got me."
BIG	Did you have a nice day?
CARRIE	I had a fabulous day.
BIG	Good for you.
CARRIE	"As Big's car drove away, I realized having three soul mates already nailed down made it a lot easier to spot those great, nice guys to have fun with."
CARRIE	"A little past 10:00pm, I was dressed to the nines at Brasserie 8-1/2."
CARRIE	"Located on the corner of ""Right Now"" and ""Everyone Was There"" it was the place to see and be seen."
STANFORD	Look at that one.
STANFORD	"Mary, hail a cab."
STANFORD	Do you think he's a model?
CARRIE	"a model what? a model citizen, a model home a model airplane?"
STANFORD	I think he's the dirty-haired Gucci guy with clean hair.
CARRIE	He's so versatile.
CARRIE	Why don't you go over and say hello?
STANFORD	He's gorgeous.
STANFORD	The only way to get a guy like him interested in me would be to pay.
CARRIE	"My love, there's no need for you to enter Hookerville."
STANFORD	"Carrie, I know what I look like."
CARRIE	Then you can't see what I see.
LYNNE 	Carrie!
CARRIE	Lynne Cameron was a much sought after fashion-show producer as valuable to a show's success as Valium or Velcro.
LYNNE 	I just told Damian you have just so fucking saved my life.
CARRIE	I did?
LYNNE 	"Sorry, this is my Boyfriend, Damian."
LYNNE 	"I use the term ""boyfriend"" loosely, as Damian is clearly a homosexual."
CARRIE	"In that case, this is my boyfriend, Stanford."
LYNNE 	You so have to be in this fashion show I'm doing.
LYNNE 	A mix of models and New York people with style.
LYNNE 	And no one is more New York or has more style than you.
CARRIE	"Lynne, I'm a writer."
LYNNE 	"You're fucking doing my show if I have to hunt you down skin you alive, and have one of the other models fucking wear you."
CARRIE	I'll call you next week.
LYNNE 	Could this place be any louder?
CARRIE	Bye.
STANFORD	I am so coming.
CARRIE	To what? I'm not a model.
STANFORD	Then you can't see what I see.
IRANDA	I'll start with a salad with extra blue cheese dressing.
IRANDA	Thank you.
SAMANTHA	Are the vegetables on the veggie plate organic?
CARRIE	"They have beef pot pie on the menu, what do you think?"
SAMANTHA	I'll just have a cup of hot water with lemon.
SAMANTHA	Thank you.
CHARLOTTE	Isn't it hard to eat just organic all the time?
SAMANTHA	It is so hard.
SAMANTHA	Last night I could not stop thinking about a Big Mac.
SAMANTHA	"I finally had to get dressed, go out and pick up a guy."
IRANDA	Talk about a happy meal.
CARRIE	"Lady, you have never looked better."
CARRIE	Your body is amazing.
SAMANTHA	I hope so.
SAMANTHA	I'm having nude photographs taken on Wednesday.
IRANDA	What're you gonna do? Have postcards made up to hand out to prospective dates?
SAMANTHA	This is not about a man's approval.
SAMANTHA	This photo is just for me.
SAMANTHA	"So when I'm old and my tits are in my shoes I can look at it and say, ""Damn, I was hot."
IRANDA	""" Isn't that a little narcissistic?"
SAMANTHA	No one thinks That when You get your seventh-grade picture taken.
CHARLOTTE	You weren't naked in that.
CARRIE	That we know of.
SAMANTHA	"Look, I like my body."
SAMANTHA	"I'm getting these pictures taken, what's the big problem?"
CARRIE	"No problem, you're my hero."
CARRIE	I think it's fantastic that you can just put it out there.
CARRIE	I can't even say yes to being in some charity fashion show.
SAMANTHA	"""New York Style""?"
CARRIE	Yeah.
SAMANTHA	You were asked to be part of that? That's huge.
SAMANTHA	All the Top designers are doing it.
SAMANTHA	they want You to be a model?
CARRIE	"No, it's a mix of real people and models."
CARRIE	I know the producer.
CHARLOTTE	"You have to do it, you live for fashion."
CARRIE	I do not live for fashion.
CHARLOTTE	How many fashion shows did you drag me to during Fashion Week?
CARRIE	"Eight, what's your point?"
CHARLOTTE	Why are You turning down the chance to Actually be in one?
CARRIE	I do not belong on a runway.
CARRIE	"Runways are for models, not writers."
CHARLOTTE	What's the difference between strutting down a runway and the way you strut down Fifth Avenue? Strut?
CARRIE	do I strut? am I a strutter?
CHARLOTTE	I think it'd be fun.
CHARLOTTE	I was a teen model when the Ralph Lauren store opened in New Haven.
IRANDA	"Okay, it's amazing I was able to keep my lunch down just now."
CARRIE	I just I cannot imagine walking down a runway while people sit there and judge me.
CHARLOTTE	No one Would judge you.
CARRIE	we judge models All the time.
IRANDA	"But you're not a model, you're one of the real people."
CARRIE	Exactly.
CARRIE	I don't want people to think that I can't see the difference between a model and me.
SAMANTHA	Who gives a fuck what people think? This is a fabulous opportunity.
SAMANTHA	Honey.
SAMANTHA	You'll probably get to keep the clothes.
CARRIE	I thought of that!
CHARLOTTE	I'd do it in a New York minute.
SAMANTHA	So Would I.
CARRIE	"What do you think, mutey?"
CARRIE	While Miranda would never dream of walking on a runway she had no problem running on one.
DAVE	I happen to know you were on that treadmill for longer than 30 minutes.
DAVE	That's illegal here at Crunch Fitness.
IRANDA	I'm starting to train for the marathon.
IRANDA	first time.
DAVE	"I was the captain of my high-school track team, but the marathon I'm Dave."
IRANDA	Miranda.
IRANDA	Have a good workout.
DAVE	That's it?
IRANDA	is There more?
DAVE	I hope so.
DAVE	I've been watching you for months.
DAVE	I think that you are very sexy.
CARRIE	"So, what's the problem? He said, ""I think you're very sexy."
IRANDA	""" And? I was wearing no makeup and my Hanes $3 old man's undershirt."
CARRIE	Nice.
IRANDA	I can't believe a guy would think that I was sexy.
CARRIE	"Okay, I'm hanging up now."
IRANDA	I'm serious.
IRANDA	"Smart, yes."
IRANDA	"Sometimes cute, but never sexy."
IRANDA	"Sexy is the thing I try to get them to see me as, after I win them over with my personality."
CARRIE	You win men over with your personality?
IRANDA	They want you to be a model?
CARRIE	"Okay, I'm hanging up now."
CARRIE	"Later that night, I got to thinking about Narcissus."
CARRIE	"A man so consumed with his own image, he drowned in it."
CARRIE	"Did he have no best friends to mirror back a healthier view of himself? And why is it that we can see our friends perfectly but when it comes to ourselves, no matter how hard we look do we ever see ourselves clearly? Samantha, on the other hand, saw herself a little too clearly."
PHOTOGRAPHER	"Okay, Samantha Tiger, here, has a variety of music choices to ease you into the shoot and help you to feel more comfortable."
PHOTOGRAPHER	Tiger?
TIGER	I've got some Steely Dan
SAMANTHA	I'm comfortable.
PHOTOGRAPHER	Okay.
PHOTOGRAPHER	"Camera, Tiger."
TIGER	"Yes, sir."
CHARLOTTE	do You like your gynecologist?
CARRIE	"She's amazing, why?"
CHARLOTTE	I think I might wanna see someone else.
CARRIE	What's happening?
CHARLOTTE	Trey and I are Still Just talking.
CHARLOTTE	We're not ready to move back in yet.
CARRIE	What's happening with your vagina?
CARRIE	"Sweetie, I'm not bugged, it's just us listening."
CHARLOTTE	Maybe a yeast infection.
CHARLOTTE	But my gynecologist says no.
CHARLOTTE	But something's definitely off.
CARRIE	What are the symptoms?
CHARLOTTE	I don't wanna talk about this.
CHARLOTTE	Can you call my machine and leave her number?
CARRIE	"Do you know anyone that Stanford could go out with? If we don't find someone, he's gonna start dating hookers."
CHARLOTTE	Hookers?
CARRIE	Exactly.
CARRIE	"Charlotte would you say that I'm strutting right now? Charlotte decided for Stanford Blatch, it would have to be someone cute."
CARRIE	"Someone with style, someone like Anthony, her wedding-gown stylist."
ANTHONY	what?
CHARLOTTE	"Anthony, Hi."
CHARLOTTE	It's Charlotte York MacDougal.
ANTHONY	"Sorry, thought it was my mother."
ANTHONY	"I get her the cheapest sheets I can, from Bed, Bath and friggin' Beyond."
CHARLOTTE	I was wondering if you were dating anyone now.
ANTHONY	"I'm dating everyone now, why?"
CHARLOTTE	"I have this friend, Stanford"
ANTHONY	What's he look like?
CHARLOTTE	He is adorable.
ANTHONY	"In a movie, who would play him?"
CHARLOTTE	I don't know A younger Ed Harris.
ANTHONY	That's hot.
CARRIE	"And speaking of hot, Miranda ended her first date with Captain Crunch."
IRANDA	That was fun.
IRANDA	I hope I didn't talk too much.
DAVE	"I think the only words you actually said all night were, ""That was fun."
DAVE	""" God, you are so sexy."
DAVE	What? You don't think so?
CARRIE	Maybe he was right.
CARRIE	"After all, who was Miranda to argue with the Captain? Hello?"
LYNNE	Miss Motherfucker why have you not returned my last 200 phone calls?
CARRIE	Lynne.
CARRIE	I really don't think that I should do this show.
CARRIE	"I mean, come on, I am not a model."
LYNNE 	"And as much as I would like to think Carrie, you're in or you're out, I don't have time for this."
LYNNE	I'm sure Dolce & Gabbana can find someone else to dress.
CARRIE	Dolce & Gabbana?
LYNNE	Each designer picks the person they want to dress.
CARRIE	Dolce & Gabbana picked me?
LYNNE	"Yes, fuckette."
LYNNE	And those are some picky Italians.
CARRIE	Do you think that I would be able to keep the outfit?
	"What's up, love?"
CARRIE	I'm coming.
OSCAR	Me likie.
OSCAR	Perfect in the bust and the waist.
OSCAR	"Turn, love."
OSCAR	Do we likie?
OSCAR	No likie the length.
OSCAR	We must take it up about four feet.
CARRIE	"I know, I'm too short."
CARRIE	But I'm very comfortable in heels.
CARRIE	"Honestly, the higher the better."
CARRIE	So feel free to put me up in the big gal shoes.
OSCAR	"Walk, love."
OSCAR	"If we gave it to Heidi, we wouldn't have to take it up."
CARRIE	Heidi Klum?
OSCAR	"Yes, turn, love."
OSCAR	"Yes, trot back."
CARRIE	Trot?
OSCAR	Good.
OSCAR	Look what the pussies dragged in.
PAUL	"Hello, Oscar."
OSCAR	"We're just calling me ""O"" now, love."
PAUL	Who's this?
OSCAR	"Carrie Bradshaw, our New York Style model."
CARRIE	"Model, God, no."
CARRIE	I'm a writer.
PAUL	I'm Paul Denai.
PAUL	I'm a photographer.
CARRIE	"I'm Sure, I love I'm sorry."
CARRIE	"No, I'm sorry."
CARRIE	I just I know your photographs.
PAUL	I'm doing a little behind-the-scenes book about Fashion Week.
PAUL	Do you mind if I shoot your fitting?
CARRIE	"Sorry, I wasn't ready."
CARRIE	So go ahead.
PAUL	"That's the point, don't mind me."
CARRIE	I like the element of surprise.
OSCAR	"I could give you a surprise, love."
OSCAR	"Now, what's your opinion, love?"
CARRIE	me love Or Him love?
OSCAR	"You, love."
CARRIE	"I don't know, whatever you think."
OSCAR	"No, changed my mind, got something better."
CARRIE	That was bad.
CARRIE	"I'm sorry, I'm very uncomfortable having my photograph taken."
PAUL	How does a girl who doesn't like having her picture taken wind up in a fashion show?
CARRIE	I'm in it for the free goods.
PAUL	Maybe if I explained how a camera works over a glass of wine sometime
CARRIE	I've never been a gal to turn down a free lesson.
PAUL	Or a free dress.
OSCAR	Here it is.
OSCAR	Do we likie?
CARRIE	We likie!
CARRIE	And speaking of uncomfortable
DOCTOR	Okay you can put your legs down now.
DOCTOR	It is not a yeast infection.
CHARLOTTE	It's not?
DOCTOR	I have an entire file Of Women All with the same symptoms.
DOCTOR	"Itching, stinging, burning."
DOCTOR	All of them think they have a yeast infection.
CHARLOTTE	It's not.
DOCTOR	It could be vulvodynia.
CHARLOTTE	is It serious?
DOCTOR	no.
DOCTOR	It's mostly just uncomfortable.
DOCTOR	We can get it under control.
DOCTOR	I'm gonna prescribe a light antidepressant.
CHARLOTTE	But I'm not depressed.
DOCTOR	It's not for you.
DOCTOR	It's for your vagina.
CARRIE	Your vagina's depressed?
CHARLOTTE	The mood elevator sort of corrects the imbalance.
IRANDA	"Wait, how do you know your vagina's depressed?"
CHARLOTTE	There are symptoms.
CARRIE	It can't meet its deadline?
IRANDA	It always wants to go to Krispy Kreme?
CHARLOTTE	"It's so funny, my vagina's depressed."
CHARLOTTE	Stop.
CHARLOTTE	I might have vulvodynia.
CARRIE	Vulva What ya?
CHARLOTTE	"So, everyday I have to keep a vagina journal."
IRANDA	Come on.
IRANDA	"A ""Dear vagina, why so blue?"" Kind of journal?"
CARRIE	"""Dear vagina ""guess who I have a crush on?"""
CHARLOTTE	"More like: ""Itchy today? Not itchy."
CARRIE	""" Sounds like a bestseller."
WAITRESS	Ready to order?
CARRIE	I guess we're still waiting.
CARRIE	But could I have a hot water and lemon? Thanks.
IRANDA	"I'm fine, but, Charlotte, maybe your hmm-hmm would like an order of fries."
CHARLOTTE	"I guess not, thank you."
SAMANTHA	Sorry I'm late.
SAMANTHA	I had to pick up my nude contact sheets.
SAMANTHA	Look.
IRANDA	"Okay, but only until the food arrives."
SAMANTHA	"Charlotte, I want your professional art-eye opinion."
CHARLOTTE	That's not very arty.
CHARLOTTE	I can see your Everything.
SAMANTHA	This is the full frontal.
SAMANTHA	I just did that to warm up.
CHARLOTTE	"You should have warned me, really."
SAMANTHA	What's the big deal? It's just a vagina.
CHARLOTTE	It's magnified.
CHARLOTTE	I've never even seen mine that close.
SAMANTHA	You've never seen yourself up close and personal?
CHARLOTTE	have You seen yours That close?
CARRIE	How'd I get involved?
IRANDA	You've never looked at yourself with a hand mirror?
SAMANTHA	"Oh, my God! Honey, I insist you go home right now and take a look. Or better yet, take my compact and make a quick trip to the ladies' room."
CHARLOTTE	I don't want to look.
CHARLOTTE	I think it's ugly.
IRANDA	Maybe that's why it's depressed.
SAMANTHA	What did I miss?
CARRIE	On their second date Miranda did most of the talking.
CARRIE	She was feeling confident and sexy.
IRANDA	I like my life.
IRANDA	"I love my job, I love my friends."
CARRIE	She couldn't believe how comfortable this new Miranda felt.
IRANDA	And I love meeting new people like you.
CARRIE	Miranda had no idea what had changed.
SAMANTHA	I want pure class.
SAMANTHA	I'm thinking ash or a charcoal-gray matte inside the frame.
FRAMER	Inch on either side?
CARRIE	Even though Samantha had done the photo just for her she still wanted to be seen a certain way by men.
FRAMER	Charcoal would bring out the gray tones.
SAMANTHA	"The matte should stop about an inch away from my breast right here, see my breast? And then stop right around here, near my ass."
SAMANTHA	See that? Right near my ass.
FRAMER	How's next Thursday?
SAMANTHA	Whatever.
CARRIE	And you took this one of Cindy Crawford.
PAUL	"See, ""Photo by Paul Denai."
PAUL	""" How can you still remember? It was the '90s."
CARRIE	It was '92.
CARRIE	I loved her beauty mark so much.
CARRIE	"I used to pencil one on, you know, and then I'd move it around whenever I had a blemish."
CARRIE	"So, you know, it'd be here, then here and sometimes here and here."
CARRIE	Here's another one.
CARRIE	man.
PAUL	I can't believe you have this book.
PAUL	It's getting embarrassing.
CARRIE	are You crazy?
CARRIE	I love this.
CARRIE	"When I first moved to New York, and I was broke sometimes I would buy Vogue instead of dinner."
CARRIE	I just felt it fed me more.
PAUL	I used to do all that high-fashion shit but the behind-the-scenes stuff I'm doing now is so much better.
PAUL	It's more real.
CARRIE	Real.
CARRIE	Ick.
PAUL	The reality of people and all their little flaws it's the little flaws that make them so much more beautiful.
CARRIE	Forget reality and tell me about the models.
CARRIE	Who's a big bitch and who's a bigger bitch?
PAUL	Sorry I never click and tell.
PAUL	Why are you so fascinated with the models?
CARRIE	I just love 'em. They're just beautiful.
PAUL	I wanna show you something.
PAUL	You show me one model who's more alive or more beautiful than her.
STANFORD	"So, Which one is your New boyfriend?"
CARRIE	It was Only one kiss.
STANFORD	It's so predictable.
STANFORD	A model dating a photographer.
CARRIE	"Stanny, I'm a model."
STANFORD	Excuse me.
STANFORD	I may have a stroke.
STANFORD	Do I look all right? I'm nervous about the Charlotte fix-up.
CARRIE	"You look fabulous, have fabulous seats."
CARRIE	Everything's gonna be fabulous.
CARRIE	I can't think about you now.
CARRIE	I'm a model.
STANFORD	You're a supermodel.
CARRIE	I made them put me in these super high heels.
CARRIE	I'm gonna be so freaking tall.
STANFORD	"Supermodel and super size it, please."
CARRIE	"Excuse me, hi, I'm Carrie Bradshaw."
AN IN BLACK	Where do I go? Over with the non-models.
CARRIE	What's her problem?
STANFORD	Gucci and Dolce and Dior.
CARRIE	"Oh, my."
CARRIE	"Look, this is the Polaroid of the dress."
CARRIE	Me likie.
CARRIE	That's a fashion thing.
STANFORD	Here's one of Frank Rich.
STANFORD	And Fran Lebowitz.
STANFORD	These are the other real people?
LYNNE	"Okay, what the fuck's wrong?"
CARRIE	"Frank Rich, Lynne? Fran Lebowitz? What, Dolce & Gabbana couldn't get Ed Koch?"
LYNNE	"Gucci got him, what's the problem?"
CARRIE	I'm such an idiot.
CARRIE	Actually convinced myself I belonged here.
STANFORD	You do belong here.
CARRIE	Can I go home?
LYNNE	"No, the entire show is timed per model."
CARRIE	I'm a non-model.
LYNNE	But you're fabulous.
LYNNE	Lighten up.
STANFORD	"Okay, so you're not Heidi Klum."
STANFORD	But you're the modeliest of the real people.
IRANDA	"I mean, he told me I was sexy."
IRANDA	And then he didn't want to kiss me.
IRANDA	Was it me? Suddenly I wasn't sexy? What does it mean?
SAMANTHA	Who knows? He's a man. You can lay your pussy on a table in front of one and still not know what he's thinking.
CARRIE	And just when I thought it couldn't get any worse
OSCAR'S ASSISTANT	"There's been a change, you're not wearing this."
OSCAR'S ASSISTANT	You're wearing this.
CARRIE	Okay.
CARRIE	I'm gonna need to speak to someone.
OSCAR	"I had to lose the dress, love."
OSCAR	I saw that Dior is showing something similar right before you.
OSCAR	It's a fashion house of cards.
CARRIE	I can't wear jeweled underwear.
OSCAR	I just want you to look at them. Aren't they fantastic?
CARRIE	How can I make this clear? Me no likie.
CARRIE	"Paul, can you do something?"
CARRIE	"Okay, but not that."
OSCAR	"Oh, my God! Try them on, you'll love them."
CARRIE	"No, please, really, I'm gonna faint."
CARRIE	I can't wear jeweled panties and strut out in front of Frank Rich.
CARRIE	I respect Frank Rich.
CARRIE	Frank Rich is a writer.
OSCAR	"You're not just wearing panties, love."
OSCAR	They come with a fantastic coat.
OSCAR	Trot round there and try them on.
CARRIE	"I have a certain look, you know? And I just really don't think that jeweled panties is it."
OSCAR	"If you look like a whale, we won't send you out there."
OSCAR	"We're Dolce & Gabbana, for Chrissakes."
OSCAR	Now come out or I'm coming in.
OSCAR	God! Fantastic.
OSCAR	Now the hair's all wrong.
OSCAR	We need big hair.
ANTHONY	"Char, this is so exciting."
CHARLOTTE	"Stanford Blatch, this is Anthony."
STANFORD	Hi.
STANFORD	"Marantino, is that Italian?"
ANTHONY	Sicilian.
STANFORD	Is that different?
ANTHONY	Yeah.
STANFORD	I'd better go check on Carrie.
ANTHONY	"Ed Harris? Try ""Ed, I have no hair-is."
CHARLOTTE	""" I thought you two would hit it off."
ANTHONY	"Why, because he's gay and I'm gay? Let me clear something up for you."
ANTHONY	I'm a nice little package.
ANTHONY	"I got good arms and a high, tight ass."
ANTHONY	I could do a lot better.
CARRIE	Ten minutes and ten hair extensions later
STANFORD	I can't believe Charlotte would set me up with such a queen. Is that who she thinks I am? Someone who'd date such queen?
CARRIE	I don't have time to decipher the levels of queendom in your world right now. Would you please go get me another champagne?
CARRIE	That is big hair.
ORLANDO	Thank you.
OSCAR	"Orlando, she looks Fabulous."
OSCAR	We need the big eyes to go with the big hair.
OSCAR	"Kevyn Aucoin, Carrie Bradshaw."
KEVYN	"Nice to meet You, Ready for makeup?"
CARRIE	"Okay, sure."
CARRIE	"Hi, I know you're a genius, but here's the thing."
CARRIE	I'm a writer.
KEVYN	"I know, I'm a big fan of your column."
KEVYN	"Don't worry, you're gonna look fabulous."
CARRIE	Okay.
KEVYN	okay?
STANFORD	here.
CARRIE	Nobody's listening to me.
CARRIE	They keep telling me I'm fabulous.
STANFORD	You are Fabulous.
CARRIE	Bring Samantha here.
CARRIE	She'll tell me the truth.
STANFORD	I can't go back.
STANFORD	That queen's out there.
CARRIE	go.
STANFORD	Crisis.
SAMANTHA	Carrie needs to see you backstage.
STANFORD	Where's her highness?
CHARLOTTE	what?
STANFORD	"your little friend, where is he?"
CHARLOTTE	He had to go.
STANFORD	Why? He didn't like me?
CHARLOTTE	He had a decorating emergency.
STANFORD	I've been rejected by someone I wasn't interested in.
STANFORD	I hate when that happens.
AN IN BLACK	"Lynne, we're okay to go."
LYNNE	"Lights, go."
LYNNE	"Music cue four, go."
	Gucci.
CARRIE	Samantha? Tell me the truth.
CARRIE	"I know people don't mean it when they say that, but I do."
SAMANTHA	Honey you're a model.
CARRIE	"You'd tell me, right?"
SAMANTHA	Absolutely.
SAMANTHA	You're a model.
CARRIE	Look how tall I am.
CARRIE	The shoes were my idea.
	Christian Dior.
SAMANTHA	I gotta get out there.
SAMANTHA	"Go, model."
CARRIE	All Right.
CARRIE	You're Heidi Klum.
CARRIE	Really?
HEIDI 	Do I look okay?
CARRIE	You look Fabulous.
HEIDI 	Thanks.
HEIDI 	"Okay, let's go."
CARRIE	Okay.
OSCAR'S ASSISTANT	Bye.
CARRIE	Bye-bye.
SAMANTHA	Wait till You see our gal.
IRANDA	Really?
CHARLOTTE	When is she coming out?
SAMANTHA	She's next.
	Dolce & Gabbana.
LYNNE	"Carrie, go."
SAMANTHA	Didn't I tell you?
LYNNE	"Fuck me hard! Heidi, go."
STANFORD	"Oh, my God, she's fashion roadkill."
CARRIE	Stop fucking taking my picture.
CARRIE	"I had a choice, I could slink off the runway and let my inner model die of shame or I could pick myself up, flaws and all, and finish."
CARRIE	And that's just what I did.
CARRIE	Because when real people fall down in life they get right back up and keep on walking.
LYNNE	"Katia, go."
CARRIE	"Turns out, my little act of bravery inspired three other people to acts of bravery as well."
CARRIE	Miranda faced her fear of knowing the truth.
IRANDA	Hi.
DAVE	Hi.
IRANDA	I'm really confused.
IRANDA	I thought we had a good time and then you never called.
IRANDA	And I never called because you never called.
IRANDA	"I guess that's fine, but I just have to know."
IRANDA	Did I do something?
DAVE	No.
DAVE	Yeah I don't know.
DAVE	"We were sitting on the couch, and you just You seem a little full of yourself."
IRANDA	"Okay, glad we straightened that out."
DELIVERY BOY	Cheeseburger and fries.
CARRIE	Samantha faced her fear of what real food would do to her perfect figure.
SAMANTHA	Thanks.
DELIVERY BOY	Nice ass.
SAMANTHA	I didn't tip you enough.
CARRIE	And Charlotte faced her fear of seeing herself.
CARRIE	"And just like Narcissus before her Charlotte became so mesmerized by what she saw, that"
CARRIE	And as for me I tucked my jeweled underwear and my inner model away where they belonged and went back to my life as a real person.
CARRIE	"Someone once said that when one door shuts, a window opens."
CARRIE	Big and I had shut our door but our window was open and blowing a great breeze.
BIG	People don't dress up anymore.
CARRIE	like with waistcoats.
BIG	And watch fobs.
BIG	I'm gonna bring back the watch fob.
CARRIE	a man with a plan.
CARRIE	"Smoke, please."
CARRIE	"Now that Big and I weren't playing the dating game, we were free to just play and it had never been better."
CARRIE	Where is it?
CARRIE	Wow.
CARRIE	Impressive.
BIG	The ladies enjoy sleight of hand.
CARRIE	And the watch fob.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, 35 blocks north at Dr."
CARRIE	And Mrs.
CARRIE	Young's cocktail party another set of ex's were enjoying the view.
CHARLOTTE	Look at all the shades of green in the hillside.
CHARLOTTE	It's so beautiful.
TREY	What's beautiful is your ass in that skirt.
CHARLOTTE	Trey.
TREY	It is.
CARRIE	Now that Trey and Charlotte had opened the door of communication Trey wanted to get in everywhere.
TREY	I'd like to do some very dirty things to you right now.
CHARLOTTE	"We're at Winky and Bob's cocktail party, and I'm your estranged wife."
TREY	My estranged wife has a damn fine ass.
CHARLOTTE	I think it's really great how up for things you've been lately.
CHARLOTTE	But we are in public.
CHARLOTTE	"So why don't we get our coats and go back to your place because my ass will be damn fine there, too."
PARK AVENUE WOMAN #1	"For a radiologist, he's awfully full of himself."
PARK AVENUE WOMAN #2	His wife is even worse.
PARK AVENUE WOMAN #1	They were passed over for three Park Avenue co-ops because of that yippie dog.
PARK AVENUE WOMAN #2	That's what you get for over-breeding the Pekingese.
CARRIE	Certain behavior will keep you from getting into a co-op.
CARRIE	And certain behavior is almost assured to get you kicked out of one.
CHARLOTTE	The entire surgical staff of Lennox Hill Hospital is in the next room.
TREY	"They'll understand, this is an emergency."
CHARLOTTE	at least close the door.
CARRIE	While Charlotte walked through her door I reached mine and kept it firmly closed.
CARRIE	"Okay then, Houdini."
BIG	I'll walk you up.
CARRIE	I think I got It from here.
BIG	Then I'll watch from down here in case you trip.
CARRIE	What's with the There will be no
BIG	"Okay, you're the boss But I'm always available for the Nighty night."
CARRIE	Nighty night.
CHARLOTTE	Have you guys ever done it in a restaurant bathroom?
CARRIE	Lotus.
IRANDA	Sparks.
SAMANTHA	Somewhere over Chicago.
IRANDA	She said restaurant bathroom.
SAMANTHA	There were warm nuts involved.
CARRIE	Classy.
CHARLOTTE	how about a coatroom?
CARRIE	Lotus.
SAMANTHA	my last birthday party.
IRANDA	I'm out.
IRANDA	Syrup?
CARRIE	"Are these theoretical questions, or are you getting busy, missy?"
CHARLOTTE	"Trey and I coatroom, Friday."
CHARLOTTE	Bistro bathroom last night.
CARRIE	But I thought he couldn't
CHARLOTTE	"Apparently he can, All over Manhattan."
CARRIE	This is a very happy development.
CHARLOTTE	"No, we're not even together anymore."
IRANDA	Doesn't sound that way to me.
CHARLOTTE	"We're supposed to be getting to know each other again, not Fucking against a hand dryer? It is so confusing."
CHARLOTTE	Are we dating or are we back together? Is he my boyfriend or my lover? Or my ex-husband whom I have sex with occasionally in coatrooms?
IRANDA	and bathrooms.
CARRIE	"I'm going with ""D,"" all of the above."
SAMANTHA	who cares What You are? Just enjoy it.
CHARLOTTE	"No, I need to know where we're going."
CARRIE	"We'd like to know, too, since you'll be having sex there."
IRANDA	Why define it?
CHARLOTTE	"He's my husband, we were defined by law. Now it's all blurry, it's so hard."
SAMANTHA	Thank your lucky stars.
CHARLOTTE	enough about me.
CHARLOTTE	What did you do this weekend?
CARRIE	Monkey bar.
IRANDA	Fun!
IRANDA	with whom?
CARRIE	Big.
CARRIE	"The bar, not the bathroom."
CHARLOTTE	So you and Big are really friends or something?
CARRIE	Yeah.
IRANDA	friends Or something.
CARRIE	"easy, prosecutor."
IRANDA	Shouldn't you define your relationship?
CARRIE	Charlotte didn't have to.
IRANDA	Charlotte married the guy.
CARRIE	We're undefinable.
SAMANTHA	She's sleeping with him.
CARRIE	I am not sleeping with him.
CARRIE	We're just hanging out.
CARRIE	"It's fun, in fact now that the pressure's off, we're finally enjoying each other."
CARRIE	It's good.
IRANDA	It's a slippery slope.
IRANDA	"Without boundaries, you won't know what'll happen."
CARRIE	We might actually have fun.
SAMANTHA	"Have fun, just don't have amnesia."
IRANDA	Exactly.
CARRIE	Can we lighten up on the boundary talk? I'm fine.
CHARLOTTE	Are you thinking about sleeping with him?
CARRIE	no.
IRANDA	You hesitated.
CARRIE	I was swallowing.
CARRIE	"The Eskimo have hundreds of words for ""snow."
CARRIE	""" And we've invented three times that many words for ""relationship."
CARRIE	""" But the more words we invent, the harder it becomes to define things."
CARRIE	"In a world where you can date without sex screw without dating and in the end keep most of your sex partners as friends long after the screwing is over what really defines a relationship? That night, Miranda let her boundaries down with Doug a cartoonist for The New Yorker."
CARRIE	They had been dating for about a month.
CARRIE	"Miranda didn't know what they were, but she knew it felt good."
CARRIE	It was a morning of firsts.
CARRIE	It was the first time Doug had spent the night and the first time a man had peed in front of her.
CARRIE	"That night, we went to Charlotte's gallery for the opening of an exhibit by Maria Diega Reyes, the Brazilian artist."
IRANDA	He just whipped it out.
IRANDA	I'm brushing.
IRANDA	"I look over, he's peeing."
CHARLOTTE	You can probably say he's your boyfriend.
CHARLOTTE	Only a boyfriend would do that.
IRANDA	I don't want a boyfriend who does that.
IRANDA	It's never okay to do that.
IRANDA	"Wait your turn, shut the door, do your business."
CARRIE	This is perfect.
CARRIE	Ms.
CARRIE	Boundaries has found Mr.
CARRIE	No Boundaries.
ARIA	Do you like it?
SAMANTHA	I do.
ARIA	It's the artist's favorite.
SAMANTHA	You know her?
ARIA	I am her.
SAMANTHA	"I'm sorry, I should have"
SAMANTHA	Samantha.
ARIA	Maria.
SAMANTHA	I have a bone to pick with you.
SAMANTHA	"I came ready to buy, and look all these red dots, there's nothing left."
ARIA	That's never bad news for the artist.
ARIA	But I have many more in my loft.
ARIA	"If you ever want to come down, take a look"
SAMANTHA	"I will, and soon, before those get sold out from underneath me, as well."
ARIA	It's a deal.
SAMANTHA	now a non-art-related Question.
SAMANTHA	Where are all the hot guys? Maria.
BEAUTIFUL WOMAN	Hi.

BEAUTIFUL WOMAN	"It is stunning, all of it."
BEAUTIFUL WOMAN	"I'm so proud of you, chica."
ARIA	Enjoy! It's my ex.
ARIA	And about the hot guys.
ARIA	No hot guys.
SAMANTHA	"That's good for you, but what's in it for me?"
CARRIE	"The next night, my ex introduced me to a tiny jazz club in the East Village."
BIG	Aren't these cats amazing?
CARRIE	"""Cats""?"
BIG	"Loosen up, baby, we're below 14th Street."

BIG	You want another drink? Do you want another drink?
CARRIE	Yeah.

	We're gonna take a short break.
	"When we come back, if you're nice we'll play another set or two."
CARRIE	"Apparently, everyone in the universe wanted me to define my relationship with Big."
BIG	What do You think?
CARRIE	"I like It, baby."
BIG	"Didn't think I had that groovy jazz club in me, did you?"
CARRIE	No.
BIG	"Hey, man, you were really great."
RAY	"Not great, I'm just trying to keep up."
CARRIE	You were great.
RAY	You know jazz?
CARRIE	No.
BIG	Can I buy you a drink?
RAY	"No, I own the place."
RAY	It's the only way they'll let me play.
RAY	I can't keep a beat.
RAY	At least I can drink for free.
RAY	Ray King.
CARRIE	"Hi, I'm Carrie Bradshaw."
CARRIE	Jazz neophyte.
CARRIE	"Sorry, this is"

RAY	Hell of a lot of mortgages.
BARTENDER 	"Cointreau on ice, white wine"
CARRIE	"Jeez, I gotta go."
RAY	Heading uptown?
CARRIE	I am.
RAY	You need a ride?
CARRIE	That'd be great.
BIG	I'll call my car.
RAY	This time? Cabs are lined up outside.
CARRIE	So then we'll take a cab.
BIG	"Okay, we'll take a cab."
CARRIE	Okay.
CARRIE	You sure your bass is gonna be okay?
RAY	"Yeah, sleeps at the club all the time."
RAY	Sometimes it even hooks up with the snare drum.
BIG	Cabs are bullshit.
RAY	"Listen, can I get your number?"
CARRIE	Yeah.
CARRIE	"Sure, let me just I'm a writer with no pen."
CARRIE	Thank you.
BIG	No problem.
BIG	6-7-3-9

RAY	Nice to meet you.
CARRIE	Nice to meet you.
CARRIE	Bye.
CARRIE	What are you doing?
BIG	What do you mean?
CARRIE	You know what I mean.
CARRIE	Now he's gonna think we're together.
BIG	"What, you like the porkpie hat?"
CARRIE	That's not the point.
BIG	"I'll tell you, he had some breath on him."
CARRIE	his breath was Fine.
BIG	Are you kidding? It was like he had a bad burger with B.B. King in '75.
CARRIE	All right.
CARRIE	We gotta figure out what we're doing here.
BIG	What are we doing?
CARRIE	What are we?
BIG	"We're friends, how's that?"
CARRIE	What kind of friends?
BIG	Friends who listen to jazz friends who eat pizza.
BIG	Friends who
CARRIE	There will be no
BIG	Carrie likes her jazz man.
BIG	Jazz.
CARRIE	All right.
CARRIE	"That's it, I'm going upstairs."
BIG	suit yourself.
CARRIE	I have to Go to sleep.
BIG	Nighty night.
CARRIE	But I couldn't sleep.
CARRIE	My bizarre mÃ©nage-Ã -taxi was haunting me.
CARRIE	Hello?
RAY	"You know, when I hear that song, I think of you."
RAY	"I don't even know you, how fucked up is that?"
CARRIE	That's good.
CARRIE	Can you hang on a second?
RAY	Yeah.
CARRIE	Okay.
CARRIE	Hello?
BIG	What are You doing?
CARRIE	I can't talk right now.
BIG	You're on the other line?
CARRIE	I am.
BIG	Porkpie?
CARRIE	"Look, I gotta go."
BIG	Tell Him he needs mints.
CARRIE	I'm hanging up.
BIG	Carrie likes a jazz musician.
CARRIE	Sorry.
RAY	No problem.
RAY	"Listen, I'd like to take you out on Saturday night."
RAY	I promise you won't have to listen to me play.
CARRIE	"Okay, I'd like that."
RAY	Great.
RAY	Don't bring the angry guy.
CARRIE	He's not so bad.
RAY	see you.
CARRIE	Okay.
CARRIE	What do You want?
BIG	What do You see in That Guy?
CARRIE	He knows when to say good-bye.
CARRIE	"The next morning, Miranda decided I might have been right."
CARRIE	Maybe she was Ms.
CARRIE	Boundaries.
CARRIE	If she wanted a decent relationship she couldn't throw the boy out with the toilet water.
CARRIE	She would have to let down her boundaries.
CARRIE	And there was no better time than the present.
IRANDA	"Hi, you scared me."
DOUG	You got any bagels?
IRANDA	Top Of the fridge.
DOUG	Cool.
DOUG	What about filters?
IRANDA	Above the coffee maker!
CARRIE	While Miranda tried to do her business Samantha helped Maria with hers.
SAMANTHA	am I doing this right?
ARIA	"Don't think, just do it."
ARIA	"You know, painting is like eating, like sex."
SAMANTHA	I can do that.
SAMANTHA	"You know, I came to buy art, not make it."
ARIA	This is a Brazilian thing.
ARIA	Everyone that crosses my door has to help.
ARIA	"But you have a choice, really."
ARIA	You can make a painting or you can do my laundry.
SAMANTHA	Not gonna happen.
ARIA	"You're buying one of my paintings, right?"
SAMANTHA	You're buying my next manicure.
ARIA	I'm sorry.
SAMANTHA	Do we Do we need to talk about this?
ARIA	Do we?
SAMANTHA	"I've done the girl thing once, twice usually involving a guy and a couple of Quaaludes."
SAMANTHA	"It was nice, really."
SAMANTHA	And really nice for the guy.
SAMANTHA	But I'm not a relationship person.
SAMANTHA	And you're really something.
SAMANTHA	Could we be friends?
ARIA	It depends.
ARIA	"In my language, ""friends"" translates to a person with a warm heart that buys a lot of my art."
SAMANTHA	"What's Portuguese for ""working it""?"
ARIA	Working it.
CARRIE	"The next day, I found the perfect color on me."
CARRIE	And something else on Charlotte.
CARRIE	"Excuse me, but is that a hickey?"
SAMANTHA	let me see.
CARRIE	"Oh, my God, I don't That's so retro."
CHARLOTTE	Trey and I made out in the movies.
IRANDA	"No, that is retro."
CHARLOTTE	That's not all we did.
CHARLOTTE	"Right in the middle of the movie, I gave him a blow job."
CHARLOTTE	In the theater.
CARRIE	"Crouching Charlotte, Hidden Hummer."
CHARLOTTE	You Guys were Right.
CHARLOTTE	"Once I stopped defining everything, I realized how great we have it."
SAMANTHA	"Congratulations, sweetie."
SAMANTHA	"It sounds like you got a nice, healthy relationship."
CARRIE	Charlotte realized if Samantha defined her relationship as healthy she had one sick relationship on her hands.
CARRIE	"The next day, as Trey looked for action Charlotte went looking for answers."
CHARLOTTE	"Please, not here."
TREY	should we Go to a movie?
CHARLOTTE	No! We're five blocks from your place.
CHARLOTTE	We'll just wait and we'll get in our old bed and we'll really make love like man and wife.
TREY	I don't want to wait.
CHARLOTTE	Why can't we wait? It's five stupid blocks.
CHARLOTTE	"What is wrong with us? Are you so scared that if we go back to a bed, you'll have the same problems again?"
TREY	Please. Let's not discuss this in front of the driver.
CHARLOTTE	You just wanted to have sex in front of him.
CARRIE	And just like that Charlotte slammed the door on her and Trey.
CHARLOTTE	Hello.
TREY	It's me.
TREY	"So if we were to, say make love in my bed could we still do it in a taxi?"
CHARLOTTE	We'll see.
TREY	"All right then, call you tomorrow."
CARRIE	"Evidently, when Charlotte closed the taxi door she opened a whole new window."
CARRIE	"The next morning, Miranda got up early to pee in peace and make Doug coffee."
DOUG	Smells great.
IRANDA	It's the cinnamon I add to the
CARRIE	"Apparently, when Miranda left the door open for peeing she opened the door for everything else."
DOUG	Sometimes I like to add a pinch of nutmeg to my coffee it takes a lot of the
CARRIE	Maybe it was narrow-minded.
CARRIE	"But for Miranda, an open-door dump was definitely worth dumping someone over."
CARRIE	"That's the thing about New York, everyone's always going."
CARRIE	"Tonight, it was to the opening of Tao."
CARRIE	Ray's and my first date.
CARRIE	Everyone was there everyone.
CARRIE	"So, what? This is the only restaurant in New York opening tonight?"
BIG	The Burger King on Ninth Avenue had a line around the block.
CARRIE	You remember
BIG	Yeah.
RAY	"Hey, man."
BIG	How are you? This is Sha.
CARRIE	Sha?
SHAY	"The ""Y"" is silent."
SAMANTHA	Thank God you're finally here.
SAMANTHA	"I got the last table, let's go."
SHAY	Okay.
CARRIE	"There we were, me, my ex the jazz guy, the model the lesbian, and her friend Samantha."
CARRIE	Sha?
BIG	She's a supermodel.
CARRIE	Super for you.
BIG	Think we'll ever get our Mee Krob?
ARIA	I love Mee Krob.
ARIA	It's their specialty here.
CARRIE	Is there any more wine in there?
CARRIE	Thanks.
RAY	I'll be back.
CARRIE	Stop.
RAY	"Look at me, I grabbed some Mee Krob."
CARRIE	Mee-Krob-a-licious.
CARRIE	How'd you get this?
RAY	Turns out the chef worked at one of my clubs.
CARRIE	You know all the right people.
RAY	I got the in on the noodles.
RAY	"If it's okay with you, I'm gonna camp out here for a while."
CARRIE	It's okay by me.
RAY	That table is bad.
CARRIE	"Yeah, man."
BIG	Good thing we weren't fucking hungry.
SHAY	I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
BIG	"Turn right at the Buddha, honey."
SAMANTHA	"Just to, you know, get things straight you and Carrie are just friends now, right? You're available?"
BIG	"Yes, ma'am."
SAMANTHA	So if you're just friends what exactly do you think you're doing? Because that girl might come off like she's all strong and over it but she's fragile and she's my best friend.
SAMANTHA	So I suggest you back off.
BIG	Can't we all just get along?
SAMANTHA	Excuse me.
ARIA	You okay?
SAMANTHA	"I'm fine, I'm sorry."
SAMANTHA	That guy's not good for her.
ARIA	"Look, I'm gonna go."
SAMANTHA	Don't go.
SAMANTHA	We can get another table.
ARIA	I lied.
ARIA	I can't just be your friend.
ARIA	What I saw back there You were magnificent.
ARIA	And how do you say that You kick ass.
ARIA	And I see where this is going and you don't do relationships.
ARIA	It would be very bad for me.
SAMANTHA	So we can't even be friends?
ARIA	I'm gonna go in here and you go back there. And you're really something.
CARRIE	Right then and there Samantha decided to let down her boundaries and opened herself up to the possibility of a relationship with a woman.
CARRIE	And in a different bathroom
CARRIE	I'm sorry.
SHAY	It's okay.
SHAY	Come in.
SHAY	want some?
CARRIE	"No, All set, Thanks."
CARRIE	Okay.
SHAY	"You can go, it's okay."
CARRIE	I don't really have to go.
SHAY	Thank God.
SHAY	He talks about you.
CARRIE	Oh?
SHAY	Did you two used to date or something?
CARRIE	Something like that.
CARRIE	"Okay, I'm gonna My date's waiting for me."
SHAY	Okay.
CARRIE	Sorry.
CARRIE	I couldn't avoid it.
CARRIE	"Everywhere I went, I was confronted by my Big relationship."
CARRIE	"I just left silent ""Y"" in the bathroom and P.S."
CARRIE	", apparently the '80s are back."
BIG	"Listen, we're gonna go."
CARRIE	"Okay, Ray and I were gonna go first."
BIG	see You later.
CARRIE	Okay.
RAY	You know what I love about this city? Everything can sound like a jazz riff.
RAY	Like that garbage truck is
CARRIE	Really? 'Cause I get more of a Like a I don't know.
RAY	"You really don't know jazz, do you?"
CARRIE	"I just scatted on my first date, man, give me some credit."
CARRIE	"Somewhere between the Mee Krob and the model, I was dating again."
CARRIE	It was nice.
CARRIE	This is me.
RAY	You know what you are? You're
CARRIE	"Do-do-do, right back at you. With every second of our kiss it was becoming clearer I really liked this guy."
CARRIE	So maybe that's it.
CARRIE	What ultimately defines a relationship is another relationship.
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
CARRIE	"New York City, no matter how well you think you know it there's always somewhere or someone new to discover."
CARRIE	"I was on my second date with Ray King, who lived in Queens but it felt like our second, third and fourth date because we'd been to three jazz clubs in one night."
RAY	"I can't sing for shit, but damn, can I chop."
CARRIE	And where does one learn this skill?
RAY	Jersey Shore.
CARRIE	Is that where you're from?
RAY	Listen.
RAY	This lick right here is why I wanted to play the bass.
RAY	Man.
RAY	"How about that? Jesus, that's sweet."
RAY	Listen to that again.
RAY	How about that?
CARRIE	This might be a good time to tell you I don't like jazz.
RAY	Why would you say something like that?
CARRIE	"I don't know, you can't follow it and there's no melody."
CARRIE	And it's just like It's all over the place.
RAY	"Carrie, you gotta stop trying to make it be something else and appreciate it for what it is."
RAY	"Damn, I wish I had my bass."
RAY	"Come here, you be the bass."
CARRIE	Don't I have to be in the musician's union or something? You play all those instruments?
RAY	"""Play"" is a little strong."
RAY	"I learn a few notes, I get bored, I move on."
RAY	Listen to the bass.
RAY	The beauty of jazz is that it can go anywhere.
RAY	It can go from here to here to here
CARRIE	It was right about that time that I started to appreciate a little type of music we call jazz.
IRANDA	So what did you do last night?
CARRIE	I listened to jazz.
CHARLOTTE	What is so funny about jazz?
CARRIE	"Okay, here it is."
CARRIE	"Last night, with Ray I had the most intense orgasm of my entire life."
IRANDA	I did my laundry.
IRANDA	Continue.
CARRIE	"It doesn't make sense, I barely know him."
CARRIE	We've only been on two dates.
CHARLOTTE	And yet you had sex with him.
SAMANTHA	Can everyone please let Carrie talk about the sex?
CARRIE	"The mind-blowing sex. Now I realize that this next statement makes me a bit of a freak, but I usually have to be in love with someone to have that kind of orgasm."
SAMANTHA	You might want to see someone about that.
CARRIE	What the hell is going on?
CHARLOTTE	Maybe Ray is the one.
SAMANTHA	Your clitoris seems to think so.
CARRIE	It was probably just a fluke.
CARRIE	I'm going back tomorrow to find out.
IRANDA	"I, on the other hand, am on strike."
CHARLOTTE	What does that mean?
IRANDA	It means I'm not having any more sex.
SAMANTHA	"That's not a strike, honey, that's a slump."
IRANDA	"No, it might have started as a slump, but I'm in control of it now."
IRANDA	I've made the conscious decision not to have sex until conditions improve.
CARRIE	How many people will be affected by this strike?
IRANDA	"So far, just the one, but I'm optimistic."
IRANDA	"The thing is, I can't go on any more bad dates."
IRANDA	I would rather be home alone than out with some guy who sells socks on the Internet.
SAMANTHA	I'm dating someone.
SAMANTHA	Someone I actually like.
SAMANTHA	Maria.
CHARLOTTE	"My Maria, from the gallery?"
SAMANTHA	"She's my Maria now, we're having a relationship."
SAMANTHA	"Yes, ladies, I'm a lesbian."
CARRIE	Wait a second.
CARRIE	You're in a relationship?
SAMANTHA	Yes.
SAMANTHA	And she just walked in.
SAMANTHA	Please get those looks off your faces.
ARIA	Hello.
SAMANTHA	You know Charlotte.
ARIA	Sure.
SAMANTHA	And this is Carrie and Miranda.
ARIA	Hi! It's so nice to meet you.
ARIA	I see you told them.
CARRIE	"How does that work? You go to bed, you wake up the next morning and you're a lesbian?"
IRANDA	"I forgot to tell you, I'm a fire hydrant."
CARRIE	I'm a shoe.
CARRIE	"I always wanted to be one, and now I am."
CHARLOTTE	"I don't think she's a lesbian, I think she just ran out of men."
IRANDA	"Then you go on strike, you don't eat pussy."
CARRIE	"Did you just say ""eat pussy""?"
IRANDA	"I did, but just for emphasis."
CARRIE	"You know, the truly amazing thing is, I had the news tonight."
CARRIE	I had the most intense
IRANDA	"""Mind-blowing,"" I believe was the word."
CARRIE	orgasm of my life and Samantha still managed to up-sex me.
CHARLOTTE	They met at my gallery.
CHARLOTTE	I introduced them.
CARRIE	You're a pimp.
CARRIE	"Later that night, inspired by Samantha's willingness to explore new territory Charlotte felt it was time to conquer some old territory."
CARRIE	The bed where she and Trey had so much trouble as man and wife.
TREY	Here we are.
CHARLOTTE	Yep.
TREY	Should we have a glass of wine first?
CHARLOTTE	"I'm fine, unless you"
TREY	"No, I'm okay."
CHARLOTTE	If you don't feel ready
CARRIE	Just because she was on strike didn't mean she had to do without.
CARRIE	That's how Miranda discovered the perfect relationship.
CARRIE	Jon Stewart and chocolate Ã©clairs.
JON STEWART	"be here today and she is, from what I understand, in love with me."
CARRIE	That night Charlotte and Trey enjoyed a sweet ending to their evening as well.
TREY	Not bad.
CHARLOTTE	It was almost mind-blowing.
CARRIE	Charlotte was relieved.
CARRIE	Now that they had fixed their problem in the bedroom she was ready to move back into the other rooms as well.
CHARLOTTE	So what are you thinking?
TREY	I'm thinking I've never seen my John Thomas so hard.
TREY	"I swear, at times I felt like it was gonna rocket right off."
TREY	What were you thinking?
CHARLOTTE	I don't know.
CHARLOTTE	Should I Do you Are we ready to
TREY	"Go again? Houston, we don't have a problem. Three, two, one, blastoff!"
CARRIE	who is it?
RAY	It's Ray.
CARRIE	"Hi, come on up."
CARRIE	Shit.
SAMANTHA	"So, did you and the girls run down the street talking about me?"
CARRIE	Maybe.
SAMANTHA	how many blocks?
CARRIE	"Two, okay, nine."
SAMANTHA	"Honestly, I'm a little hurt."
SAMANTHA	After all the hours I've spent listening to you people talk about your relationships.
SAMANTHA	You do that? I make the courtesy call.
SAMANTHA	"""Do you think you love him? Blah, blah, blah."
CARRIE	""" You just caught us a little off guard with the lesbian thing."
SAMANTHA	"That's just a label, like Gucci or Versace."
CARRIE	Or Birkenstock.
SAMANTHA	This is not about being gay or straight.
SAMANTHA	Maria is an incredible woman.
SAMANTHA	"She's got passion, and talent intelligence"
CARRIE	a vagina.
SAMANTHA	Vagina schmagina.
CARRIE	"""Schmagina""? Is that what the lesbians are calling it?"
SAMANTHA	"For your information, we haven't even had sex yet."
CARRIE	Wow.
CARRIE	You really are in a relationship.
SAMANTHA	I am.
SAMANTHA	Life is not all about sex.
CARRIE	Try telling that to her schmagina.
RAY	"I want a bourbon, and I want to go down on you."
RAY	Not necessarily in that order.
SAMANTHA	The truth is I really want it to be special the first time.
CARRIE	I'm sure that it will be special.
CARRIE	"I'm sure it will be special, because"
SAMANTHA	Is Ray there?
CARRIE	"No, Samantha, I'm listening."
CARRIE	I'm listening.
CARRIE	"The next day, I thought about what Samantha said."
CARRIE	She wasn't having sex because she wanted to have a relationship and I was having mind-blowing sex hoping to turn it into a relationship.
CARRIE	So there you have it.
CARRIE	We've got a relationship without sex and sex without a relationship.
CARRIE	"Which had a better shot at survival? I couldn't help but wonder, what comes first, the chicken or the sex? That night I decided to really talk to Ray."
CARRIE	I figured we needed to catch the relationship up to the sex.
CARRIE	That was the plan.
CARRIE	Wait a minute.
CARRIE	I asked you a question.
CARRIE	Where did you go to school?
RAY	All over.
RAY	"Freckles on the legs, nothing wrong with that."
CARRIE	It was my best relationship ever.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, over at Casa de Lesbo"
SAMANTHA	"That coq au vin was amazing. You can paint, you can cook, you can do everything."
ARIA	But you brought the most incredible dessert.
ARIA	Want a bite?
CARRIE	Samantha decided if she was going to be gay she'd be gay all the way.
SAMANTHA	I might not be much in the kitchen but I'm more than enough in the bedroom.
SAMANTHA	Baby.
ARIA	Samantha.
ARIA	It's not really working for me.
CARRIE	It was a phrase Samantha had never heard in bed before.
SAMANTHA	"Honey, I've never gotten any complaints from the men."
ARIA	Men.
ARIA	I want you to look at me.
ARIA	Connect with me.
ARIA	This is lovemaking.
ARIA	It's not a porno flick.
ARIA	I want to show you.
ARIA	I'm gonna lay down.
ARIA	And I want you to look at my boceta.
ARIA	"It's a Portuguese word for ""pussy."
CARRIE	""" Meanwhile, Miranda, still off sex and on chocolate couldn't bring herself to order the seven Ã©clairs she really wanted."
CARRIE	So she asked for just one.
IRANDA	"One cake, please."
IRANDA	Which do You recommend?
CLERK	I'd go with the Louvre.
CLERK	Monsieur Payard's signature chocolate cake.
IRANDA	Sold.
CLERK	"Okay, that'll be $74.50"
IRANDA	As in 74 dollars and 50 cents?
CLERK	Yes.
CARRIE	Miranda decided she didn't need a cake that badly especially when she could make one for under $5.
CARRIE	"Every once in a while, a girl has to indulge herself."
CHARLOTTE	I'm on the mallard!
TREY	Sorry.
CHARLOTTE	He still hasn't asked me to move back in.
CHARLOTTE	We make love all over the apartment.
CHARLOTTE	In the morning I get in a cab and go home like a Park Avenue hooker!
IRANDA	Can't you bring it up?
CHARLOTTE	"No! We finally got the penis working, I don't want to scare it."
CHARLOTTE	Why can't I have the relationship and the sex? Why is it one or the other?
CARRIE	You got me.
IRANDA	I wanna order.
SAMANTHA	Where's the lesbian du jour?
CARRIE	"Listen, you guys, when she gets here, we have to talk about her relationship. She was mad we didn't take it seriously last time."
CHARLOTTE	Please.
CHARLOTTE	"She isn't having a relationship, she's just doing this to bug us."
CARRIE	I don't know.
CARRIE	They haven't even had sex yet.
CARRIE	She said she wants it to be special.
CHARLOTTE	Really?
CARRIE	Yeah.
CHARLOTTE	Then we should be supportive.
CHARLOTTE	This is the healthiest thing she's done in ages.
IRANDA	Does anybody want to split the chocolate pudding?
SAMANTHA	"Morning, ladies."
CARRIE	morning.
"CHARLOTTE, MIRANDA"	Hi!
CHARLOTTE	Tell us about your relationship.
CHARLOTTE	How is everything going with Maria?
SAMANTHA	Did you know that when a vagina gets engorged it expands to the size of a fist? It's like a fabulous cave.
IRANDA	I guess they've had sex.
CARRIE	Apparently so.
SAMANTHA	and we have Three holes down there.
CHARLOTTE	"Okay, stop talking about your relationship."
SAMANTHA	But it's fascinating! There are places a dick just can't go.
CARRIE	Some dicks manage just fine.
SAMANTHA	"Please, Maria has 10 dicks."
IRANDA	"For the record, you started this."
CARRIE	I am sorry but a finger is not a dick.
IRANDA	A finger is more like a third of a dick.
IRANDA	"So technically, Maria only has three and a third dicks."
SAMANTHA	"I can tell you right now, this is not the same as this."
CHARLOTTE	"Okay, put that away."
SAMANTHA	"I'm just saying, size has nothing to do with it."
IRANDA	What's happening to you?
SAMANTHA	"I'm getting an education. Not only do I now know everything there is to know about the glorious boceta That's Portuguese for ""pussy."
CARRIE	""" ""Boceta, schmagina, let's call the whole thing off."
SAMANTHA	""" The most important thing is that Maria has taught me how to connect during sex."
SAMANTHA	It's not just some animal act.
SAMANTHA	It's about two people making love.
RAY	Hi.
RAY	I couldn't pick a shirt.
RAY	"Red, blue, I didn't know."
RAY	"Come on in, I'm making margaritas."
CARRIE	Look what I bought today.
CARRIE	my first jazz CD.
RAY	no.
RAY	You gotta hear that on vinyl.
CARRIE	"Wait, Ray."
CARRIE	Stop.
CARRIE	Don't play anything.
CARRIE	"Don't scat, don't chop, don't blend Could we Could we just sit and talk for a while?"
RAY	"The ""gotta talk"" girl, gotta talk. ""What are you thinking? Where is this going?"""
CARRIE	"I'm not that girl. I'm not any girl, I just want to talk."
CARRIE	"You know, talk."
CARRIE	"Like, where are you from? You said something about the Jersey Shore."
RAY	I spent a couple summers there.
RAY	Worked on the boardwalk.
RAY	There was a skeet shooting place I went to.
RAY	"on the Jersey Shore? Upstate New York, college."
RAY	"And, pull! Man, why no skeet in the city? I love the skeet."
RAY	I should open one in New York.
RAY	Maybe sell a club.
RAY	When was the last time you had canned corn? That sounds good right now.
RAY	"You hungry? No, because remember I met I had a pot pie in Vegas once, loaded with corn"
CARRIE	As Ray talked I realized he wasn't spontaneous and unpredictable and thrilling.
CARRIE	He was a guy with ADD.
CARRIE	What kind of relationship could I have with a guy I couldn't even talk to?
RAY	Flaky crust.
CARRIE	I'd have to end it.
RAY	You like pies?
CARRIE	Wanna play me?
RAY	Yeah.
CARRIE	Eventually.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, uptown"
TREY	I was thinking.
CARRIE	Charlotte gave Trey one more chance to ask her to move in.
TREY	I'm just gonna say it.
TREY	Next time I'm hard would you consider measuring my John Thomas?
CHARLOTTE	What? No!
TREY	"I understand, it's juvenile, I know."
TREY	But I've just never seen it like this.
CHARLOTTE	I'm taking a shower.
CARRIE 	Charlotte was never a woman who cared much about penises and now a penis was running her life.
CARRIE	Forget it.
CARRIE	As Charlotte lathered up she really started to get lathered up.
CARRIE	"Who did he think he was? He was her husband, and she was his wife."
CARRIE	What the hell was going on in this Upper East Side nightmare?
CHARLOTTE	I'm tired of being married to your penis! I am a person.
CHARLOTTE	"This is supposed to be a relationship! And I am done walking on eggshells! ""Don't talk about moving in in front of the penis ""'cause it might go soft."
CHARLOTTE	""" ""The penis likes this,"" and ""The penis doesn't like that!"" And ""The penis wants to be measured!"""
TREY	It was Just a thought.
CHARLOTTE	Here's another thought! You can shove this marriage up your ass!
TREY	Don't go.
CHARLOTTE	"I'm going home to my own apartment, where I have a lease."
CHARLOTTE	I hope that you and your penis have a very lovely night!
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, Miranda was getting fed up as well with herself."
CARRIE	"Hi, it's me, leave a message."
IRANDA	"I know you're probably busy having mind-blowing sex right now but I feel that you need to know, your good friend, Miranda Hobbes has just taken a piece of cake out of the garbage and eaten it."
IRANDA	You'll probably need this information when you check me in to the Betty Crocker Clinic.
CARRIE	That night Miranda realized she'd been using chocolate as a substitute for sex and now she needed a substitute for chocolate.
CARRIE	The strike was officially over.
ARIA	That's perfect!
CARIE	Just when she thought she knew everything there was to know about women Samantha caused the very elusive female ejaculation.
SAMANTHA	Was that good or bad?
ARIA	That was very good.
CARRIE	Samantha got the relationship and the sex.
CARRIE	"In fact, a little more sex than she'd expected."
CARRIE	I want some water.
RAY	You want some water? Be right back.
CARRIE	"The next morning, I woke up with a new thought."
CARRIE	Maybe Ray was like jazz.
CARRIE	"Instead of trying to make him be something else, I needed to let go and appreciate him for what he was."
CARRIE	Truly mind-blowing sex.
CARRIE	But unfortunately I got the feeling Ray had stopped playing me and moved on to another instrument.
TREY	"Morning, ma'am."
CHARLOTTE	Morning.
TREY	You left something at my At the apartment.
TREY	I want you to move back in and get rid of this old apartment.
TREY	"And stay all night, every night."
TREY	And wake up next to me every morning and be my wife.
CHARLOTTE	You do?
TREY	Yeah. I talked it over with my penis and we both agree.
TREY	I don't want to lose you again.
TREY	Charlotte York MacDougal will you remarry me?
CHARLOTTE	"Yes, Trey MacDougal I will remarry you."
CARRIE	"Walking home from ADD, ""another dating disaster"" I worried that there's a reason they call it ""mind-blowing"" sex."
CARRIE	Maybe that kind of physical connection obliterates the chance of an intellectual one.
CARRIE	Or maybe it's possible to find both.
CARRIE	"That's what I was hoping, because great sex is great but I still like a song with a melody I can sing to."
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
CARRIE	New York City can be a terrifying place.
IRANDA	Hi.
IRANDA	"Just coffee and a muffin, please."
CASHIER	That'll be $7.50
CASHIER	Nothing's more frightening than the prospect of seeing an ex before you've had your morning coffee.
STEVE	Miranda?
IRANDA	You made me burn my tongue.
STEVE	"I got to work on That, Sorry."
STEVE	You look great.
STEVE	How you doing?
IRANDA	"Good, you know, boring."
IRANDA	What's new with you?
STEVE	I guess that means you didn't get the invitation yet.
IRANDA	"No, invitation to what?"
STEVE	I'm finally doing it.
STEVE	I'm opening up my own bar.
IRANDA	"Steve, you're kidding! That's"
STEVE	"That's scary, right?"
STEVE	And it's happening soon.
STEVE	It's next Saturday.
STEVE	I'd really love it if you'd come.
STEVE	"Miranda, you remember Jessica?"
IRANDA	Sure.
IRANDA	Of course.
STEVE	"You'll come, right, next Saturday?"
JESSICA	We'd love to see you there.
IRANDA	"She ""we'd"" him, Carrie, right in front of me."
CARRIE	"Miranda, I'm still asleep."
CARRIE	How can you have had an emotional mini-drama already?
IRANDA	No way I'm going to his opening.
IRANDA	Do you think I should go?
CARRIE	let me think for a second.
IRANDA	What really pisses me off is It was my idea.
IRANDA	I'm the one who told him to open his own bar.
IRANDA	But do I get Any credit?
CARRIE	I'm guessing not.
IRANDA	"Of course not, it's infuriating! Why wasn't he this ambitious while with me?"
CARRIE	Maybe you inspired him.
CARRIE	"Maybe he named the bar ""Miranda's"" or ""Hobbes' Nob."
IRANDA	""" He named the bar ""Scout."
IRANDA	""" After his dog."
IRANDA	I'm not going to that.
CARRIE	You have to go.
CARRIE	"You guys are friends now, right? That's what friends do."
IRANDA	"Really? You're my friend, does that mean you have to go?"
CARRIE	Of course.
CARRIE	Absolutely.
CARRIE	That's what friends are for.
CARRIE	"Forget it, not going."
SAMANTHA	to what?
SAMANTHA	What is it?
SAMANTHA	"""Steve and Aidan""?"
CARRIE	How did this happen? Why are they even friends?
IRANDA	"According to Steve's girlfriend, Jessica who answered his phone while he was in the shower today"
CARRIE	"I love how you say ""Jessica,"" like allegedly that's her name."
IRANDA	Aidan is Steve's silent partner.
SAMANTHA	I wonder why I didn't get an invitation.
CARRIE	"You can have mine, sister, 'cause I'm not going."
IRANDA	"Come on, it's a big party, you may not even see him."
CARRIE	It's not a party.
CARRIE	It's a parade of our failed relationships.
CARRIE	"Next, you're gonna tell me that my junior prom date's the barback."
CHARLOTTE	It's good Aidan invited you.
CHARLOTTE	It means he's ready to be friends.
CARRIE	"I don't know what it means, don't want to find out."
IRANDA	"It means, ""I forgive you, please come."
CARRIE	""" Nice try, I'm not going."
SAMANTHA	I'll go.
IRANDA	Thank you.
IRANDA	You see? Samantha's my friend.
IRANDA	"I'm going out with Samantha and her lesbian lover, and I am proud."
SAMANTHA	Let's not invite Maria.
SAMANTHA	I could use a night away from the old ball and chain.
CARRIE	Don't tell me you're in a sapphic slump.
SAMANTHA	"All we ever do is lie around, take baths together and talk about feelings."
CHARLOTTE	I think they call that a relationship.
SAMANTHA	I don't know how you do it.
SAMANTHA	"All that emotional chow-chow, it's exhausting."
IRANDA	"I know, don't you just hate that?"
CARRIE	"Women. That night, Samantha was determined to get Maria out of the tub and out on the town."
ARIA	"I do not see why we're out in this crowd with all this smoke, when we could be home, relaxing together."
SAMANTHA	"I thought it'd be fun to take our relationship out on dry land for a change, that's all."
SAMANTHA	"Besides, what's the fun of getting clean if you can't get a little dirty first?"
BARTENDER	"Samantha Jones what's it gonna be tonight, darling, the usual?"
SAMANTHA	Brian here happens to make the most dangerous mojitos in the city.
BARTENDER	"Two mojitos coming up, on the house."
ARIA	Fun place.
SEAN SULLIVAN 	"Hey, gorgeous."
SAMANTHA	"Sean Sullivan, what are you doing in town?"
SEAN SULLIVAN 	Back on business for a few weeks.
SEAN SULLIVAN 	What are you doing next Saturday?
SAMANTHA	Saturday?
ARIA	we have plans for Saturday.
SEAN SULLIVAN 	Okay.
SEAN SULLIVAN 	"How about a late run, then?"
SEAN SULLIVAN 	I'll call you.
ARIA	"What is this ""late run""?"
SAMANTHA	Doesn't translate.
SAMANTHA	I didn't know that we had plans on Saturday.
SAMANTHA	I promised the girls I'd go out with them.
ARIA	Should I come? I'm a girl.
SAMANTHA	"No, sweetie, I know."
SAMANTHA	"But since you don't really like to go out, I thought"
BARTENDER	"Here you go, ladies."
BARTENDER	Enjoy.
BARTENDER	I get off at 4:00.
CARRIE	"Samantha had to face her past, and Charlotte was facing her future."
CARRIE	Now that Trey had no problem getting hard in the bedroom she saw no reason why their bed should be.
CHARLOTTE	Bunny.
CHARLOTTE	Hi.
CHARLOTTE	What are you doing here?
BUNNY	When Trey told me you two were buying a new bed I insisted he let me help.
BUNNY	"I picked out the one he has now, did you know that? It's Chippendale."
CHARLOTTE	no.
CHARLOTTE	where is Trey?
BUNNY	"Still at the hospital, I expect."
BUNNY	"Don't fret, we'll find a mattress to fit the frame."
CHARLOTTE	"You know, we were hoping to find a bed that was a little bigger and less hard."
BUNNY	"My dear, I'm a firm believer in firm mattresses."
BUNNY	"Look, the perfect dust ruffle."
BUNNY	Five-pleat gusseted duster with a foot drop.
BUNNY	I have one just like it.
CHARLOTTE	"Actually, Bunny most of the newer beds don't even need dust ruffles."
BUNNY	"My dear child, you cannot not have a dust ruffle."
BUNNY	It's unsightly.
BUNNY	This is divine.
BUNNY	Nice and firm.
TREY	"Hello, my darling girls."
TREY	Sorry I'm late.
TREY	"I see you've started without me, Mother."
BUNNY	"Trey, you simply must get in and feel this, it's sublime."
TREY	Hello.
TREY	"This is comfy, isn't it? Charlotte, you really must try this."
CHARLOTTE	I was thinking more along the line
BUNNY	"Charlotte, for heaven's sake, get in."
TREY	This is heaven.
CHARLOTTE	"I'm sorry, this is just way too"
TREY	"Firm? All Right then, something softer."
BUNNY	something with a dust ruffle.
TREY	"Whatever you say, Mother."
TREY	You know best.
IRANDA	"You hear it too, Fatty?"
IRANDA	I think I might have a ghost.
CARRIE	I think I might have to Hear That again.
IRANDA	"There were weird noises last night, right above me."
IRANDA	"The cat heard it, too."
CARRIE	If the cat heard it
CARRIE	That's not a ghost.
CARRIE	That's some weird upstairs neighbor's nocturnal what have you.
IRANDA	"That's what I thought, too, at first."
IRANDA	But this morning the super let me in upstairs and there's no one living there.
IRANDA	The place is completely empty.
IRANDA	"And I know it sounds crazy, but last night I could feel it."
CARRIE	"Did the cat feel it, too?"
IRANDA	The hairs on the back of my neck all stood up.
CHARLOTTE	My grandmother had a ghost.
CHARLOTTE	And finally she had to tell it to leave.
SAMANTHA	That's exactly what you're supposed to do.
SAMANTHA	"Confront the ghost, acknowledge its presence, then release it."
IRANDA	how do You happen to know that?
SAMANTHA	Everybody knows that.
IRANDA	"The thing that I don't understand is, why now? I've been living there for two years."
CHARLOTTE	"When I was living alone, I used to feel scared like that all the time."
CHARLOTTE	"But now that I'm back with Trey, I feel so safe."
IRANDA	What are you saying? I have a ghost because I'm single? That's discrimination.
CARRIE	New York is definitely haunted.
CARRIE	"Old lovers, ex-boyfriends."
CARRIE	"Anyone you have unresolved issues with, you are bound to run into again and again until you resolve them."
CARRIE	"My relationship with Aidan was long dead, but with one invitation he was suddenly a presence in my life again."
CARRIE	Or had he been there all along? Like the chair he made that I could never bring myself to sell.
CARRIE	"When a relationship dies, do we ever really give up the ghost? Or are we forever haunted by the spirits of relationships past?"
ARIA	Why did you not introduce me to that Sean?
SAMANTHA	"He's nobody, just a guy I used to fuck."
ARIA	And the bartender man?
SAMANTHA	"He's nobody, just a guy I used to fuck."
ARIA	And why have you not told this nobody that you are with a somebody now?
SAMANTHA	"What am I supposed to say? ""Hi, this is my lesbian lover, and P.S."
SAMANTHA	", I'm done with dick""?"
ARIA	Who said anything about dick? I was talking about our relationship.
SAMANTHA	Of course you were.
ARIA	Do you miss a dick? Is that what this is all about? It's okay to tell me.
ARIA	We should talk about this.
SAMANTHA	We're talking.
ARIA	Okay.
ARIA	I'll talk.
ARIA	How many men have you been with?
SAMANTHA	How many women have you been with?
ARIA	Twelve.
ARIA	Have you been with more than 12 men?
SAMANTHA	Why are we even talking about this?
ARIA	Why are you so afraid to talk?
ARIA	always pulling away.
SAMANTHA	I'm not pulling away.
SAMANTHA	I'm trying to get closer.
ARIA	Not like that.
ARIA	Not with sex.
ARIA	I cannot just turn it on and off.
ARIA	"After all, I'm not a man."
SAMANTHA	You know what? I think I'm clean now.
CARRIE	"That night, Charlotte found herself haunted by dust ruffles, ducks and Bunny."
CHARLOTTE	"Your mother decorated this entire apartment, didn't she?"
TREY	Of course.
TREY	Mother does all our houses.
CHARLOTTE	I should have known.
CHARLOTTE	Plaid and the mallards.
TREY	You don't like them?
CHARLOTTE	"No, it's like we live in the Museum of Natural Ugliness! If we're really serious about making a fresh start with our marriage and making this our home it should reflect our taste, shouldn't it?"
TREY	"I have no taste, clearly."
CHARLOTTE	"Then my taste, for us."
TREY	"Darling, Mother spent an awful lot of time and money on this place."
CHARLOTTE	I understand.
CHARLOTTE	But I am your wife.
CHARLOTTE	"So, maybe I should just have a chat with her."
TREY	"Let me talk to her, it might go easier."
TREY	"Tomorrow, when she comes over for brunch I will sit her down and say that this is simply not our, slash, your taste."
TREY	The animals have got to go.
CARRIE	But the next morning
BUNNY	"Up and at 'em, George McFaddam."
BUNNY	It's daylight in the swamp.
CARRIE	Trey was in no condition to talk to anyone.
TREY	"Hello, Mother."
BUNNY	"Darling, what's the matter? Are you ill? Here, let Mother Sore throat."
BUNNY	"Charlotte, telephone my house and tell Geneva to bring over some broth and my overnight case."
BUNNY	You have a busy week at the gallery.
BUNNY	I might as well stay in the guest room until Trey's recovered.
BUNNY	"Charlotte, what's this mallard doing here? He lives in the study."
CHARLOTTE	"Yes, Bunny."
CARRIE	"Since I wasn't going to risk an awkward public confrontation at Aidan's opening, I wanted to at least make a gesture."
CARRIE	"Some small way of saying, ""Thank you for inviting me."
CARRIE	"""For being braver than I could have been."
CARRIE	"""And for at least suggesting that we can be friends."
CARRIE	""" Hello? There was no sign of him."
CARRIE	But he was everywhere.
CARRIE	"In the mahogany bar, the wood floors the carved ceiling."
CARRIE	The whole place looked and felt just like Aidan.
STEVE	What are you doing here?
CARRIE	I was just in the neighborhood. I just couldn't resist a little sneak preview.
STEVE	did Miranda come with you?
CARRIE	"No, I just I won't be able to come to the opening so, I wanted to thank Aidan, you know, for inviting me, so it's a mulberry bush."
CARRIE	"You know, 'cause the bar is on Mulberry Street."
STEVE	"Carrie, that's really sweet."
STEVE	"Only Aidan didn't exactly invite you, I did."
CARRIE	You did.
STEVE	"Cause I thought Miranda might feel more comfortable if she knew you were gonna be here, so"
CARRIE	"So, then Aidan didn't invite me?"
STEVE	"Not exactly, but"
AIDAN	Steve!
CARRIE	I got to go.
CARRIE	"That night, I wasn't the only one who was haunted."
CARRIE	One phone call later
CARRIE	Does the ghost like Oreos?
IRANDA	"At this point, I'm almost hoping there is a ghost. Otherwise, I'm insane."
CARRIE	You say that like it's an either-or proposition.
IRANDA	"I know, I'm sorry for making you come over."
IRANDA	"I just needed another person here, you know? 'Cause the cat's an unreliable witness."
CARRIE	Don't worry.
CARRIE	"I checked the rarely invoked haunted-house clause of the best-friend contract, you're completely covered."
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, across the park Charlotte, haunted by Bunny's decision to spend the night couldn't sleep either."
CHARLOTTE	Bunny! What are you doing?
BUNNY	I remembered I had some Vicks in my bag.
BUNNY	It's the best thing for a cold.
CHARLOTTE	But I already gave him some NyQuil.
BUNNY	NyQuil doesn't cure anything except consciousness.
CHARLOTTE	Don't you think I should do that?
BUNNY	It's no bother.
CHARLOTTE	But I am his wife.
CHARLOTTE	"If anyone does it, it should be me."
BUNNY	"Not on his tummy, Charlotte."
BUNNY	You're trying to break up the phlegm.
BUNNY	Let me.
BUNNY	You don't know what you're doing.
CHARLOTTE	And you're being very inappropriate.
CHARLOTTE	"I'm sorry, but this just isn't going to work."
CHARLOTTE	"Trey and I are back together, and this is our house."
CHARLOTTE	And we will redecorate it as we see fit.
CHARLOTTE	"No more plaid, no more duck decoys."
CHARLOTTE	From now on there can only be one lady of the house.
BUNNY	"I've been in this house far longer than you, my dear."
BUNNY	"And unlike you, I never left."
BUNNY	"Believe me, the decoys may come and go but I'm going to be here forever."
SEAN SULLIVAN 	"Samantha, you home? Come on, baby, open up, it's me, Sean."
SEAN SULLIVAN 	Sam.
SAMANTHA	What are you doing here? It's 3:00 in the morning.
SEAN SULLIVAN 	Let's fuck.
SAMANTHA	how did You even get in?
SEAN SULLIVAN 	Your security code's still the same.
SEAN SULLIVAN 	"How about it, can I come in?"
SAMANTHA	"No, you can't be here right now."
SEAN SULLIVAN 	"Come on, I got hard just walking up your stairs."
SEAN SULLIVAN 	You got another guy in here Or something?
SAMANTHA	no.
ARIA	Not another guy.
ARIA	I'm Maria Samantha's girlfriend.
SEAN SULLIVAN 	Good for you.
SEAN SULLIVAN 	That's Maybe I could come in and you two could make me a sandwich or something.
SAMANTHA	I don't think tonight's gonna be good for us.
SEAN SULLIVAN 	"Come on, I'm only in town for just a I'm sorry."
ARIA	"You get away from the door, motherfucker! Before I call the cops!"
SEAN SULLIVAN 	"Okay, goodnight."
CARRIE	And with that Maria released Samantha's ghost and confronted Samantha.
ARIA	You let men come to your door like this in the middle of the night?
SAMANTHA	"Let it go, it's all in the past."
ARIA	It's not in the past.
ARIA	It's serving us drinks.
ARIA	It's on the answering machine.
ARIA	It's at your door in the middle of the night.
SAMANTHA	"All right, this might come as a shock to you, but I used to have sex with men."
ARIA	This man was here for nothing but sex.
SAMANTHA	"Yes, which I used to enjoy and haven't had much of since I got into this relationship."
ARIA	You call this a relationship?
SAMANTHA	It's tedious and the sex is dwindling.
SAMANTHA	"So, from what I've heard, yes."
ARIA	If you have something to say to me
SAMANTHA	I have nothing to say to you.
SAMANTHA	I am fresh out of things to say to you.
SAMANTHA	All we ever do is talk.
SAMANTHA	The talking in our relationship has replaced the fucking in our fucking relationship! I don't want talk! I want passion.
SAMANTHA	I want fireworks!
ARIA	Do you want fireworks? I'll show you fireworks! That's fireworks.
SAMANTHA	What are you doing? Stop it! Stop! My plates!
ARIA	These are not your plates! You don't even cook! Want a little firework? Another little one?
CARRIE	Didn't even leave a card.
CARRIE	Now he won't know what the plant's supposed to mean.
CARRIE	It's like I plant-bombed him.
IRANDA	"So, how did the bar look?"
CARRIE	Like Aidan.
CARRIE	Amazing.
IRANDA	Good for Steve.
CARRIE	That's convincing.
IRANDA	I know.
IRANDA	I'm trying to be happy for him.
IRANDA	"He's got his own bar, his own life, his own Jessica."
IRANDA	"And I'm still here, you know? In the same apartment, doing the same job, living the same life."
CARRIE	"But you have something that no one else has, you have a ghost."
IRANDA	You have a ghost.
IRANDA	You have two.
CARRIE	But at least Big's the friendly ghost.
CARRIE	"Aidan, on the other hand I'm just afraid the way I treated him is gonna haunt me the rest of my life."
CARRIE	There's nothing I can do about it.
IRANDA	sure There is.
IRANDA	Come to the party.
CARRIE	Didn't invite me.
IRANDA	Steve's a good guy.
IRANDA	He wouldn't have invited you if it wasn't okay with Aidan.
CARRIE	Do you ever think that you might still have feelings for Steve?
IRANDA	No.
IRANDA	"God, no, why? Do you? For Aidan?"
CARRIE	No.
CARRIE	I don't know.
CARRIE	I don't think so.
CARRIE	I don't know.
CARRIE	Thank you.
CARRIE	"I left Miranda's early, got some sleep and in the light of day it felt like all my ghosts had disappeared."
CARRIE	And I saw the world exactly as it was.
CARRIE	"A few days later, Trey felt better, too."
CARRIE	So did Charlotte.
CARRIE	Especially since Bunny moved out of the guest room and back into her own apartment.
BUNNY	"Up and at 'em, George I brought some Oh, dear."
BUNNY	I brought some muffins for breakfast.
CARRIE	Charlotte didn't know whether it was their making love or their making love on a bed without a dust ruffle that had offended her.
CARRIE	"But either way, their sexorcism ensured Bunny never haunted their home again unless expressly invited."
CARRIE	"While downtown, a dearly departed spirit suddenly reappeared."
ARIA	"It's been two days, I was worried."
ARIA	And you didn't even call.
SAMANTHA	Neither did you.
ARIA	I brought you a gift.
SAMANTHA	Better be dishes.
ARIA	Open it.
CARRIE	Maria made one last-ditch effort to give Samantha what she thought she needed.
SAMANTHA	You bought me a strap-on?
CARRIE	Samantha was touched.
CARRIE	Since she couldn't bring herself to admit she wasn't capable of being in a relationship she simply said.
SAMANTHA	I guess we could give it a try.
CARRIE	"That night, despite all my fears and reservations I let Miranda and Samantha talk me into going to the opening of Scout."
IRANDA	Wow.
SAMANTHA	Who are all these attractive people? Hello.
CARRIE	"Who cares? We're looking for Aidan, ladies."
CARRIE	Eyes akimbo.
CARRIE	"That's it, stealth."
CARRIE	"What you doing there, sister? Getting your groove on, doing the robot?"
SAMANTHA	I threw my back out.
IRANDA	How?
SAMANTHA	Fucking Maria with a strap-on.
SAMANTHA	"She fucked me, I fucked her."
SAMANTHA	"With all the fucking and talking, I had no idea men had to work so hard."
IRANDA	"How does a strap-on work, exactly? Is it belted or"
CARRIE	Could we not have the strap-on conversation right now? This night is hard enough as it is. All right.
IRANDA	how Does It work?
CARRIE	What did I just say?
SAMANTHA	It doesn't.
SAMANTHA	Maria and I broke up.
CARRIE	"Sweetie, I'm sorry."
IRANDA	Was it the strap-on that broke the relationship's back or just yours?
SAMANTHA	Maria thinks I have intimacy issues.
SAMANTHA	She's crazy.
SAMANTHA	"I tried, I really did, but I'm not a relationship person."
SAMANTHA	"I told her from the start, didn't I?"
CARRIE	You most certainly did.
SAMANTHA	I did.
SAMANTHA	Then she has to go and fall in love with me.
SAMANTHA	"I mean, what the fuck! I need a drink."
SAMANTHA	Would it be bad to have a martini with my muscle relaxant or bad in a good way?
IRANDA	I don't know.
IRANDA	Are you operating heavy machinery this evening?
SAMANTHA	Never again.
SAMANTHA	Where's the bar in this bar?
CARRIE	"Miranda was right. When you see a ghost, you just know it."
CARRIE	You can feel it.
CARRIE	The hairs on the back of your neck stand up.
CARRIE	That was it? That's all I get?
CARRIE	I don't even know what that was.
IRANDA	I don't know who that was.
IRANDA	Was that Aidan?
SAMANTHA	"Does he look better, or have I just been with a woman too long?"
CARRIE	"All right, that's enough."
CARRIE	"I'm going home, I don't know why I came."
IRANDA	Because I begged you to.
IRANDA	"Come on, let me buy you ladies a free drink."
SAMANTHA	Okay.
IRANDA	I'll meet you at the bar.
CARRIE	Okay.
STEVE	You came! I'm so glad.
STEVE	So?
STEVE	What do You think?
IRANDA	I think I think You did Good.
STEVE	Really? You mean it? 'Cause I never would've done this if it wasn't for you.
IRANDA	What are you saying? I didn't do anything.
STEVE	Are you kidding me? This whole thing was your idea.
STEVE	You always told me I should start my own bar.
STEVE	I never forgot that.
STEVE	"I just never thought that I could, so thanks."
IRANDA	You did good.
CARRIE	"And just like that, Miranda gave up the ghost."
STEVE	"Come on, let's get you drunk."
CARRIE	"An hour later, since my ghost hadn't reappeared I decided to sneak out the side door for some cake and a smoke."
CARRIE	"You're not seriously smoking that, are you?"
AIDAN	is That All You Could carry?
CARRIE	shit.
CARRIE	Now I can't eat my cake.
AIDAN	Sure you can.
CARRIE	Now you got your fingers all in it.
CARRIE	That's my cake.
AIDAN	So now you want the cake?
CARRIE	I never not wanted it.
AIDAN	"Okay, lady, you take the cake."
CARRIE	You cut your hair.
AIDAN	You have frosting on your lip.
STEVE	Partner.
STEVE	It's time for our toast.
CARRIE	I thought you were the silent partner.
AIDAN	Glad you came.
AIDAN	"Good to see you, Carrie."
CARRIE	"Good to see you, too."
CARRIE	I had confronted my ghost.
CARRIE	I had accepted and released him but now I was more haunted than ever.
CARRIE	Because what I felt out there was no ghost it was real.
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
CARRIE	Despite the fact there are over 8 million people on the island of Manhattan there are times when you still feel shipwrecked and alone.
CARRIE	"Times when even the most resourceful survivor will feel the need to put a message in a bottle, or on an answering machine."
AIDAN	"Hey, this is Aidan."
AIDAN	I'm not in.
AIDAN	Leave a message.
GRACE	Strong arms.
GRACE	"Earth to heaven, yes."
GRACE	"Remember, every movement has a meaning."
CARRIE	I wondered what it meant that I wanted to talk to my ex-boyfriend again.
CARRIE	I've been making faux calls to Aidan.
CHARLOTTE	what?
CARRIE	"""Faux."
CARRIE	""" F-A-U-X, where you dial but you have no idea what to say if he answers."
CARRIE	It's emotional Russian roulette.
CHARLOTTE	"You mean, you call and you hang up?"
CARRIE	That's pretty much it.
CHARLOTTE	Why Would You do that?
CARRIE	I don't know.
CARRIE	I don't know why I'm telling you.
CARRIE	Don't tell anybody else.
CHARLOTTE	"Carrie, tell them what you told me."
CARRIE	That I'm not going to your African dance class again or that you can't keep a secret?
CHARLOTTE	Carrie's calling Aidan.
CARRIE	and hanging up.
SAMANTHA	Why are You calling him?
CARRIE	I think I want him back.
CARRIE	How do I do this?
IRANDA	"First, you have to accept that after what happened, he might not want to hear it."
CARRIE	I can accept that.
CARRIE	How do I do this?
SAMANTHA	You don't.
SAMANTHA	"One word, honey."
SAMANTHA	"""Granola."
SAMANTHA	""" So not you."
CHARLOTTE	Aidan's perfect.
CHARLOTTE	He stripped her floors.
CHARLOTTE	But he needs to lose the turquoise rings and the tummy.
CARRIE	The tummy is gone.
CARRIE	"At that thing last week, he looked disturbingly good."
IRANDA	"He's the new, improved Aidan."
SAMANTHA	low-fat granola.
CARRIE	He looks good.
CARRIE	"That's not why I want him back, I just miss him."
IRANDA	"did You, before seeing him?"
CHARLOTTE	What about the turquoise?
CARRIE	I've missed him for months.
IRANDA	"Okay, you need a safe approach, in case he rejects you."
IRANDA	E-mail him.
CARRIE	I don't believe in e-mail.
CARRIE	I'm old-fashioned.
CARRIE	I prefer calling and hanging up.
SAMANTHA	"Come on, honey."
SAMANTHA	"You gotta get online, if only for the porn."
CHARLOTTE	Would you please stop sending me those?
SAMANTHA	"Come on, it's funny."
CARRIE	"I can't get e-mail just to write to Aidan, that's pathetic."
IRANDA	"It's not just e-mail, you can shop online."
CARRIE	"No, shopping is my cardio."
SAMANTHA	"Okay, I know What to do."
SAMANTHA	"Don't call, don't e-mail just show up at his furniture store wearing these."
CHARLOTTE	What are those?
SAMANTHA	fake nipples.
IRANDA	And why are we carrying them around?
SAMANTHA	They were sent to me as a promotional thing.
CARRIE	Really? Is there a Nipple Council? Do nipples have a bad rap?
SAMANTHA	Nipples are huge right now. Open any magazine.
SAMANTHA	It's not that cold.
SAMANTHA	"Those girls are either tweaking, or they're wearing these."
IRANDA	Put them in.
IRANDA	I want to see how they work.
CARRIE	She leads with her breasts.
CARRIE	It's not a good experiment.
CHARLOTTE	"Miranda, you try them."
SAMANTHA	"Oh, yeah."
SAMANTHA	"Now that, I'd like to see."
IRANDA	"I'm not certain, but I have a feeling my boobs were just insulted."
IRANDA	"All Right, cover me."
SAMANTHA	All Right.
SAMANTHA	That's it.
CHARLOTTE	That's obscene.
SAMANTHA	"Okay, walk."
CARRIE	"""We have secretly replaced Miranda's nipples with rubber ones."
CARRIE	"""Let's see what happens."
SAMANTHA	""" Okay, that's it, I want my nipples back."
CARRIE	"The next day, sans nipples Miranda's cardio put my cardio to shame."
CARRIE	She was training for the marathon.
CARRIE	Running wasn't the only thing getting her heart rate up.
IRANDA	You sure you're in the right group?
ARATHON MAN	"Ten-minute mile, right? I was here last week."
IRANDA	I know.
IRANDA	But the thing is we never get any cute guys in this group.
IRANDA	The cute guys are in the seven-minute mile group.
ARATHON MAN	"I'm the cutest of the slow guys, is what you're saying? Knee surgery."
IRANDA	Have you run the marathon before?
ARATHON MAN	Past four years.
IRANDA	Wow.
ARATHON MAN	What about you?
IRANDA	first time.
ARATHON MAN	We should train during the week.
IRANDA	Are there runs during the week?
ARATHON MAN	I don't know. I meant just the two of us.
IRANDA	"Sure, that'd be great."
CARRIE	"Miranda was thrilled, but she still wasn't sure if he was interested in anything more than a running buddy."
CARRIE	"And uptown, Charlotte's marathon redecoration continued."
TREY	I can't believe I ever questioned this wallpaper.
TREY	I love this wallpaper.
TREY	And I love you.
CHARLOTTE	I guess we're done with this room.
CHARLOTTE	Time to move on to the study.
CARRIE	There's one room in every marriage that forces the question.
CARRIE	"""How long do we want it to be just the two of us?"""
CHARLOTTE	"It's right off our bedroom, so Well What do you want to do with this room?"
TREY	It could be a good room for a B A
CHARLOTTE	B-Y?
TREY	I think we already have enough bathrooms.
CARRIE	Trey and Charlotte were finally on the same page.
CARRIE	And the page had a baby on it.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, Samantha went shopping, nipples blazing and picked up a '94 cabernet and an '84 Harvard MBA."
WARREN DREYFOUS	"Believe me, this is nothing."
WARREN DREYFOUS	It's a blip.
WARREN DREYFOUS	"No, we can't retract it, because that's what you said."
CARRIE	"Warren Dreyfous was a founder of the communications strategy firm that made the Exxon oil spill an ""incident"" rather than a ""debacle."
WARREN DREYFOUS	""" Look, I gotta go."
WARREN DREYFOUS	"Next time, talk to me before you talk to the press."
WARREN DREYFOUS	"All right, man."
WARREN DREYFOUS	Bye.
WARREN DREYFOUS	Sorry about that.
SAMANTHA	"About talking on the phone, or staring at my nipples?"
WARREN DREYFOUS	About talking on the phone.
CARRIE	"That night, I tried to compose my first e-mail."
CARRIE	"A witty, yet sexy, yet sensitive note to Aidan."
CARRIE	"And across town, Samantha was getting some male, as well."
SAMANTHA	"As a lover, Warren was fantastic."
CARRIE	But as a communications strategist he made one major mistake.
WARREN DREYFOUS	"Samantha, does your gina-wina want a little visit from my mister-mister?"
CHARLOTTE	He didn't say that.
SAMANTHA	"It's not what he said, it's how he said it, in baby talk."
CARRIE	Baby talk's the worst.
CARRIE	How can they think it's sexy?
CARRIE	It's like putting ketchup on prime rib.
CARRIE	"Stop, you're ruining it."
SAMANTHA	"I know, it's such a shame, because this guy is hot."
SAMANTHA	I finally had to sit on his face to shut him up.
CHARLOTTE	"You know, some men use baby talk to avoid intimacy."
CARRIE	While others simply choose not to respond to your e-mail.
SAMANTHA	Aidan still hasn't written back?
CARRIE	"Fourteen hours, but who's counting?"
CHARLOTTE	"Oh, my God! Isn't this adorable?"
CARRIE	Don't you think that maybe it's a wee bit small?
CHARLOTTE	"Oh, you guys. Trey and I are trying to have a baby."
SAMANTHA	Why?
CARRIE	Don't you think that maybe you should wait awhile? You guys just got back together.
CHARLOTTE	I can't wait.
CHARLOTTE	I'm the oldest woman I know who doesn't have a baby.
CHARLOTTE	The oldest married woman who wants one.
CHARLOTTE	You know what I mean.
CARRIE	"If that's what you want, I'm very happy for you."
CHARLOTTE	Thanks.
CARRIE	You're welcome.
CHARLOTTE	"And I promise, I won't become one of those mothers who can only talk about Diaper Genies."
CARRIE	Good.
CHARLOTTE	Look over here.
SAMANTHA	What the hell is a Diaper Genie?
CARRIE	I don't know. Someone you hire to change a kid's diaper?
CHARLOTTE	"Hi, Tricia!"
CARRIE	"Tricia Watson was one of those hip moms for whom Barneys would always be stores, not dinosaurs."
TRICIA WATSON 	Cliff said you and Trey are back together.
TRICIA WATSON 	I'm so glad.
TRICIA WATSON 	This is Mary Elizabeth.
CHARLOTTE	"Hello, Mary Elizabeth."
CHARLOTTE	I'm Charlotte.
ARY ELIZABETH 	Pleased to meet you.
CHARLOTTE	Trey and I are trying to get pregnant.
TRICIA WATSON 	That's great.
CHARLOTTE	You and Cliff should come over for dinner.
CHARLOTTE	We just redecorated our dining room.
CHARLOTTE	We haven't even used it yet.
TRICIA WATSON 	"I'd love to, but try finding a sitter for three kids under 8."
TRICIA WATSON 	I can't believe I'm 34 with three kids.
CHARLOTTE	I invited the Watsons over for dinner Tuesday.
CHARLOTTE	They're bringing their kids.
TREY	All righty.
CARRIE	"Charlotte, 35 with no kids decided it was time to get serious."
CARRIE	"The next day, I worked on a little piece I was calling."
CARRIE	"""Thirty-six hours, and still no response from Aidan."
CARRIE	""" The Indians had to wait up to six months for a response."
CARRIE	It took me six months to get the message that I wanted to be with Aidan.
CARRIE	And now I couldn't wait another minute.
CARRIE	Are all these improvements in communication really helping us communicate? In matters of love do actions really speak louder than words? I decided to take action.
CARRIE	And this time he answered.
AIDAN	Hello.
CARRIE	Why won't you respond to my e-mail?
AIDAN	Who is this?
CARRIE	"It's Carrie, hi. I was just asking if you ever got my e-mail."
CARRIE	"""Shoegal."
AIDAN	""" What?"
CARRIE	That's my screen name.
AIDAN	I think I got it and deleted it.
CARRIE	That's not very neighborly.
AIDAN	"I get so much damn junk mail, if I don't know an address I have the opposite problem."
CARRIE	I've received two e-mails total.
CARRIE	"One from Miranda, and one welcoming me to AOL."
AIDAN	"What did it say? Just, you know how to use the different features and stuff, and ""welcome."
AIDAN	""" No, the one you"
CARRIE	The one I The one to you.
CARRIE	It doesn't even matter.
CARRIE	You know what I was thinking? I was thinking that you and Steve and Miranda and me could go out sometime.
CARRIE	"You know, just like as a you know, a fun group thing."
AIDAN	Sounds good.
CARRIE	"Okay, great, so I'll set it up?"
AIDAN	Okay.
CARRIE	Okay.
AIDAN	Bye.
CARRIE	Bye.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, Miranda's run led to."
CARRIE	"""Wanna come up for coffee?"""
CARRIE	Which led to sex which led her to believe that Marathon Man could be more than a running buddy.
IRANDA	I'm all sweaty.
ARATHON MAN	You taste great.
CARRIE	Did you get my e-mail about our double whatever-it-is?
IRANDA	"Yes, and I'm ignoring it."
CARRIE	"So far, not impressed with the e-mail."
IRANDA	Why Would I Go out with Steve?
CARRIE	You're not going out with him.
CARRIE	"You're going as my airbag, in case there's an impact."
CARRIE	Steve's going as Aidan's air bag.
IRANDA	Explain that to Steve.
IRANDA	I don't want him to get the wrong impression.
IRANDA	I'm dating other people now.
CHARLOTTE	Who?
CHARLOTTE	Marathon man?
IRANDA	Yes.
IRANDA	we slept together after our run.
CHARLOTTE	I Guess he was interested.
SAMANTHA	Did he live up to his nickname?
IRANDA	"It was good, except he kind of licked my butt."
SAMANTHA	Be specific.
SAMANTHA	You mean the cheeks or
IRANDA	It was more localized than that.
CHARLOTTE	"Wait a minute, are we talking tuchis-lingus?"
IRANDA	I'm afraid so.
IRANDA	And I thought it was weird.
IRANDA	"It's weird, right?"
IRANDA	Are we doing this now?
SAMANTHA	"If the guy is willing, why not?"
IRANDA	Anyone other than Samantha?
CARRIE	I never had a guy do the TL on me.
CARRIE	"One time, it almost happened, but I got the feeling he just lost his way."
CHARLOTTE	Trey likes to do it.
CHARLOTTE	We're married.
IRANDA	"Okay, I'm definitely in the slow sexual group if even Charlotte is open to this."
SAMANTHA	There's something happening with men and the ass.
IRANDA	It's true.
IRANDA	"The last few guys I've been with have been much more eager to attend to it you know, digitally."
CARRIE	How did they get the message that the ass is now on the menu?
IRANDA	"I bet there's one loud-mouthed guy who found some woman who loved it and told everybody, ""Women love this!"""
CARRIE	who is this Guy?
IRANDA	Who's the woman who loved it?
SAMANTHA	Don't knock it until you try it.
CARRIE	Bingo.
IRANDA	Maybe I shouldn't have pulled away so fast.
IRANDA	Was this my last shot? Am I out of the ass loop forever? I can't bring myself to ask for it.
SAMANTHA	"You don't have to ask for it, just lean into it."
SAMANTHA	No words necessary.
SAMANTHA	He'll get the signal.
IRANDA	But then do I have to reciprocate?
SAMANTHA	I would never do it back to them.
IRANDA	Neither Would I.
CARRIE	me neither.
CHARLOTTE	You wouldn't?
CARRIE	"That night, Charlotte performed a more traditional wifely duty."
CARRIE	She cooked dinner for her husband and their guests.
CHARLOTTE	"Go ahead, everyone."
TRICIA WATSON 	This looks amazing.
TREY	Trish is amazed that anyone cooks.
TRICIA WATSON 	"Trish has three kids, which keeps her kind of busy."
ARTIN WATSON	I don't want to sit next to the lady.
TRICIA WATSON 	"Martin, that's ""one."
TREY	How many does he get?
TRICIA WATSON 	Forty-Five.
ARTIN WATSON	But I don't wanna.
CHARLOTTE	"We can rearrange, if you want."
TRICIA WATSON 	"No, it's fine."
TRICIA WATSON 	do You need your inhaler?
ARTIN WATSON	no.
CLIFF WATSON 	He's asthmatic.
CLIFF WATSON 	Not going to be much in the sports area.
TRICIA WATSON 	Not all little boys have to play sports.
CLIFF WATSON 	Don't talk to me like you talk to the kids.
TRICIA WATSON 	"Martin, up here."
TREY	"fancy Shoes There, Hank."
ARY ELIZABETH 	they used to be mine.
CLIFF WATSON 	He won't go out without 'em.
TRICIA WATSON 	Don't talk about him like that.
CLIFF WATSON 	Don't you talk to me like that.
CARRIE	"That night, Trey and Charlotte didn't have sex."
CARRIE	"And they didn't have sex the next night, either."
CARRIE	"This time, inaction was speaking louder than words."
CARRIE	"This guy from pest control comes over and sticks a few dead ones on a tape strip I, on the other hand, was full of words."
CARRIE	They're everywhere.
CARRIE	"So I say to him, ""What are they?"" He says, ""Lady, I don't know, that's why I'm sending them to the lab."
CARRIE	""" And I'm thinking, ""This is New York, this is the pest guy."
CARRIE	"""And I got something."
CARRIE	"He doesn't know what it is ""and that ain't good!"""
STEVE	"I gotta take a leak, I'm laughing too hard."
AIDAN	"man, I was gonna go."
STEVE	And?
AIDAN	And we're men.
AIDAN	We don't do that.
AIDAN	Women can do that.
AIDAN	Men can't.
IRANDA	You should go.
IRANDA	Break with convention.
AIDAN	"What the hell, I'm man enough."
STEVE	Do I get a say in this? We're already partners in the bar.
STEVE	people are going to talk.
AIDAN	We're going to the bathroom.
IRANDA	So apparently Aidan needed an airbag in the bathroom.
CARRIE	"You know, I think I'm okay."
IRANDA	"You mean, you think you're over him."
CARRIE	"No, I think You can go."
IRANDA	I don't even get flan?
CARRIE	"The thing is, if you don't leave now then we're gonna have to end the night together. Hug and share cabs according to neighborhood."
CARRIE	And then I won't have any time alone with him.
IRANDA	Yeah.
IRANDA	Okay.
CARRIE	Okay.
CARRIE	And can you take Steve with you?
AIDAN	Thank you for walking me home.
CARRIE	You live four blocks from the restaurant.
CARRIE	It's the least I could do.
AIDAN	Good to see you tonight.
CARRIE	I think I want to get back together.
AIDAN	"Fuck, I was afraid you were going to say something like that."
AIDAN	"I was willing to try the friendship thing, but I can't do the relationship thing."
CARRIE	You put your hand on my hand.
AIDAN	What?
CARRIE	"At the restaurant, you"
AIDAN	I was trying to make you comfortable.
AIDAN	You seemed so nervous telling that bug story.
CARRIE	"Oh, well then I guess I should Goodnight."
CARRIE	Goodnight.
CARRIE	"Miranda didn't answer her phone, so I left a desperate message and started to send her a desperate e-mail."
IRANDA	I was just about to call you.
IRANDA	I was IM-ing Marathon Man.
CARRIE	Interesting.
CARRIE	Will your tuchis be wanting some lingus?
IRANDA	"Listen, if things work out between him and me we never had that conversation. He's coming over."
CARRIE	I guess you'll be having dessert after all.
IRANDA	What happened to my airbag outside the restaurant? Steve tried to kiss me.
CARRIE	Aidan kissed me.
CARRIE	We miskissed.
CARRIE	I wasn't going to kiss him.
CARRIE	He said he just wanted friendship.
CARRIE	But then he kissed me.
CARRIE	"What does that mean? Oh, my God, he's online."
CARRIE	Can he see me?
IRANDA	"No, just step away from the computer."
CARRIE	"No, I'm going to go back there."
IRANDA	Where? Aidan's?
CARRIE	I know he's home.
IRANDA	"Pace yourself, send him an e-mail or something."
CARRIE	"No, he'll just say that he doesn't want to see me, but he does."
CARRIE	"His words said ""no,"" but his kiss said ""yes."
IRANDA	""" That's the defense invoked by date rapists."
CARRIE	I know he still feels it.
CARRIE	"When men attempt bold gestures, it's generally considered romantic."
CARRIE	"When women do it, it's often considered desperate or psycho."
CARRIE	I was hoping to prove I was neither.
CARRIE	"Hey again, you."
AIDAN	You haven't been out here since I went up?
CARRIE	"No, I went home."
AIDAN	And you came back?
CARRIE	I came back.
CARRIE	"See, I I think No, I feel fairly certain that there is still something between us."
AIDAN	"I had a nice time tonight with you, I did."
AIDAN	But I just want to leave it at that.
CARRIE	Can I come up and talk to you for a few minutes?
AIDAN	I don't think that's a good idea.
CARRIE	Because of what might happen?
AIDAN	Because it's not a good time.
CARRIE	I know that you're probably scared.
CARRIE	"I would be, too."
CARRIE	But it's different now.
CARRIE	Things are different.
CARRIE	I'm different.
CARRIE	"In fact, wait a second."
CARRIE	"In fact, cigarettes? Gone."
CARRIE	"Seriously, all bad habits, gone."
CARRIE	This is a whole new thing.
CARRIE	Because I miss you.
CARRIE	And I've missed you.
CARRIE	"And it's not just because you look so good, you do, and you should know that."
CARRIE	"But I lie in bed at night, and I think about us."
CARRIE	And I think about you holding me.
AIDAN	You broke my heart!
WARREN DREYFOUS	"Samantha, I love your titty-witties."
CARRIE	As I was wishing I had said nothing Samantha decided she had to say something.
SAMANTHA	"You're a great fuck, but I don't need the baby talk."
SAMANTHA	"You don't have to call these my titty-witties, these are my breasts."
SAMANTHA	And you don't have to say anything about them.
SAMANTHA	"It's just sex, and it's fine."
SAMANTHA	Would you please come out of there? Can we talk about this like adults? We're not finished.
WARREN DREYFOUS	I was very closey-wosey.
SAMANTHA	"Okay, you can call them titty-witties."
WARREN DREYFOUS	I'm leaving.
WARREN DREYFOUS	I got an early day tomorrow.
SAMANTHA	"Come on, don't pout."
SAMANTHA	We were having such a nice time.
SAMANTHA	It was only a suggestion.
WARREN DREYFOUS	Where are my shoes?
CARRIE	Samantha realized that she wore the nipples and attracted a big baby.
CARRIE	"And speaking of babies, Charlotte and Trey still were not."
CHARLOTTE	This was delivered today.
TREY	I ordered that a week ago.
TREY	"They needed time to engrave, and I totally forgot."
CHARLOTTE	"""We had each other and then we had you."
CHARLOTTE	"""And then we had everything."
CHARLOTTE	"""Love, Mommy and Daddy."
TREY	""" It's completely premature."
TREY	I was just so excited.
CHARLOTTE	And now? Do you not want a baby anymore?
TREY	Of course I do.
TREY	Don't you?
CHARLOTTE	We pretty much stopped trying after the Watsons came over.
CHARLOTTE	Kids don't even want to sit by me.
TREY	I want to sit next to you.
TREY	"I knew Cliff and Tricia when they were first married, they were so in love."
TREY	Now they're just
CHARLOTTE	Parents.
CHARLOTTE	Maybe if we only have one child.
TREY	"Have one, to start."
TREY	See how we do.
TREY	Besides
CARRIE	Then Trey told the lie that all parents-to-be have to tell themselves in order to procreate.
TREY	our kids will be different.
CARRIE	Even though the whole experience had them a little rattled that night Trey and Charlotte made love and possibly a baby.
CARRIE	"And downtown, Miranda seemingly had her communication problem licked."
CARRIE	And she felt like she should do something in return.
ARATHON MAN	Would you like a massage?
IRANDA	I would love one.
IRANDA	I don't want to do that!
ARATHON MAN	"Why didn't you say you weren't interested, before you were talking into my ass?"
CARRIE	"This time, we didn't need any words."
AIDAN	You want to do this to make up for the past? Relieve your conscience?
AIDAN	Cause we're okay.
AIDAN	I've mentally kicked your butt all over Manhattan.
AIDAN	I'm fine now.
CARRIE	No.
CARRIE	I just I love you.
CARRIE	"I still love you, I just wish that I could be your girlfriend again."
AIDAN	I need to think about that.
CARRIE	"His actions said he still loved me, or maybe he just missed me or maybe he needed closure."
CARRIE	Maybe I'd never know.
CARRIE	"The next morning, due to sheer embarrassment Miranda got what she needed."
CARRIE	A running buddy who pushed her into the nine-minute mile group.
CARRIE	And I still had no response from Aidan.
AIDAN	"Hey, Carrie, you up there?"
AIDAN	"Okay, let's give it a shot."
CARRIE	Really?
CARRIE	Do you wanna come upstairs?
AIDAN	"No, I promised Pete I'd take him for a walk. You wanna go for a walk?"
CARRIE	Yeah! Let's go for a walk.
AIDAN	Okay.
CARRIE	"Don't move, okay? I'll be right there!"
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
CARRIE	Once Aidan and I were back together it seemed like nothing had ever happened to break us apart.
CARRIE	"Hi, it's me, go ahead."
BIG	"Hey, kid."
BIG	What's shaking? I'm back in town.
BIG	"Call me, baby."
CARRIE	I'm
AIDAN	No.
AIDAN	Yeah.
AIDAN	Yeah.
CARRIE	A little machine with a big message.
CARRIE	"Okay, something happened."
IRANDA	something bad?
CARRIE	Big called while Aidan and I were making love.
IRANDA	Something bad.
CARRIE	The machine picked up.
CHARLOTTE	What did You do?
CARRIE	Nothing.
CARRIE	We just kept making love.
SAMANTHA	He could keep going after that?
SAMANTHA	"Honey, he's a keeper."
IRANDA	"Never mind him, how'd you do?"
CARRIE	"Fine, I finished."
CHARLOTTE	You did?
CARRIE	I had to.
CARRIE	And I haven't worked that hard at anything since my SATs.
CHARLOTTE	This is awful.
CHARLOTTE	Did you talk about it?
CARRIE	"No, we just went to sleep."
CARRIE	"And when I woke up, Aidan was on the other side of the bed."
CARRIE	Usually he sleeps right next to me.
CARRIE	"You know, like, right here and I just, I get in his little nook."
CHARLOTTE	Maybe he's just sleeping differently.
CARRIE	"Maybe, or maybe he'll never forget what happened and every time the phone rings he'll think that it's Big calling to start affair number two."
IRANDA	That's a big maybe.
CARRIE	I was just hoping that we could just start fresh and now we're gonna have to talk about it.
SAMANTHA	"What are you gonna do, sit Aidan down and explain about Big?"
CARRIE	"Unless Hallmark makes a ""Sorry I Cheated"" card."
SAMANTHA	No one wants to hear about their lover's past lovers.
SAMANTHA	"What happened was in the past, leave it there."
CARRIE	It's on my answering machine.
CARRIE	I have to talk about it.
WAITRESS	"here You Go, this is yours."
SAMANTHA	Thank you.
CARRIE	Can I change the subject? I'll pay you a million dollars.
CHARLOTTE	I'm thinking about quitting my job.
SAMANTHA	did You get an offer from a better gallery?
CHARLOTTE	"No, I mean, stopping working."
CHARLOTTE	Altogether.
CARRIE	Really?
CHARLOTTE	Yeah.
CHARLOTTE	I've been driving myself crazy lately just trying to get everything done and Trey suggested
IRANDA	Trey suggested?
CHARLOTTE	He mentioned that maybe I might quit.
CHARLOTTE	"And I mean, really, I have just been driving myself crazy."
CHARLOTTE	And for what? The gallery? What has the gallery ever done for me?
CARRIE	But You love your job.
CHARLOTTE	I know.
CHARLOTTE	But there's so much more I could do with my life.
IRANDA	Like what?
CHARLOTTE	"Soon I'll be pregnant, and that'll be huge."
CHARLOTTE	"Plus, I'm redecorating the apartment and I always wanted to take Indian cooking classes and sometimes I'll walk by one of those Color Me Mine pottery places and I'll see a woman having just a lovely afternoon glazing a bowl."
CHARLOTTE	That'd be a nice change.
CHARLOTTE	And I wanted to volunteer at Trey's hospital.
CHARLOTTE	And help raise money for the new Pediatric AIDS wing.
CARRIE	"The cooking and the AIDS stuff is great, but Color Me Mine, sweetie If I was walking by and I saw you in there I'd just keep on walking."
CHARLOTTE	"Anyway, that's what I'm thinking."
CARRIE	You sure you're not just having a bad work week?
CHARLOTTE	"No, that's not it. I'm quitting, that's what I want to do, yep."
CHARLOTTE	I'm quitting.
SAMANTHA	"Well, be damn sure before you get off the Ferris wheel because the women waiting to get on are 22, perky, and ruthless."
CARRIE	You seem to have a lot of opinions today.
SAMANTHA	I'm telling you just forget it ever happened.
CARRIE	"Later that day, I got to thinking about relationships and partial lobotomies."
CARRIE	Two seemingly different ideas that might be perfect together like chocolate and peanut butter.
CARRIE	Think how much easier it would all be if there was some swift surgical procedure to whisk away all the ugly memories and mistakes and leave only the fun trips and special holidays.
CARRIE	"But until that day arrives, what to do? Rely on the same old needlepoint philosophy of ""forgive and forget""? And even if a couple can manage the forgiveness has any ever really conquered the forgetness? Can you ever really forgive, if you can't forget? To Samantha Jones, some things were unforgivable."
CARRIE	And taking someone else's cab was right at the top of her list.
SAMANTHA	I was here first!
BRAD	Sorry!
SAMANTHA	I don't think so.
SAMANTHA	Get out!
BRAD	I'm not getting out.
SAMANTHA	"West 12th and 9th Avenue, please."
SAMANTHA	I hope you enjoy the ride.
CARRIE	He did.
CARRIE	And in a far less friendly bed uptown I was even farther from the nook.
CARRIE	"Yet, I still wasn't sure, maybe I was overreacting."
CARRIE	You don't have to go to the gym right now.
AIDAN	do You want me to get All soft again?
CARRIE	I liked You All soft.
AIDAN	I didn't.
CARRIE	Give me a good morning kiss.
AIDAN	You might want to brush your teeth first.
CARRIE	"Well, that settled it."
CARRIE	He wasn't forgiving or forgetting.
CARRIE	And speaking of not forgetting
IRANDA	Hello?
CHARLOTTE	You were so judgmental at the coffee shop yesterday.
IRANDA	Excuse me?
CHARLOTTE	You think I'm one of those women.
IRANDA	What? One of what women?
CHARLOTTE	One of those women we hate who just works until she gets married.
IRANDA	"Charlotte, it's 8:15."
CHARLOTTE	That's not a response.
IRANDA	It's an 8:15-in-the-morning response.
CHARLOTTE	The women's movement is supposed to be about choice.
CHARLOTTE	"And if I choose to quit my job, that is my choice."
IRANDA	"""The women's movement""? Jesus Christ, I haven't even had coffee yet."
CHARLOTTE	It's my life and my choice.
IRANDA	"Okay, Charlotte? This isn't about me, this is your stuff."
CHARLOTTE	Admit it! You were being very judgmental.
IRANDA	I'm dripping all over my bathroom and you're calling me judgmental.
IRANDA	If you have a problem with quitting your job maybe you should take it up with your husband.
CHARLOTTE	"See, there it is, ""your husband."
CHARLOTTE	""" There's nothing wrong with having a husband!"
IRANDA	"Charlotte, I'm hanging up."
CHARLOTTE	Don't you dare hang up! And stop saying Charlotte like that.
CHARLOTTE	I am quitting my job to make my life better and do something worthwhile like have a baby and cure AIDS.
IRANDA	Oh! You're gonna cure AIDS? Good for you.
IRANDA	Just don't be too disappointed if all you wind up with is a pretty ceramic mug with Trey's name on it.
CHARLOTTE	Take that back!
IRANDA	I'm hanging up.
CHARLOTTE	Don't hang up! I'm interviewing girls to replace me and I really need you to get behind my choice.
IRANDA	You get behind your choice.
CHARLOTTE	I am behind my choice.
CHARLOTTE	I choose my choice.
IRANDA	I don't have time for this.
IRANDA	I have to go to work.
IRANDA	Some of us still have to go to work.
CHARLOTTE	I choose my choice!
IRANDA	Fuck! Jesus!
CARRIE	"When in a hostile situation some women, like Charlotte, confront it head-on while others"
CARRIE	Fresh juice?
AIDAN	Where'd you get that?
CARRIE	I ran down to the Korean.
AIDAN	Dressed like that?
CARRIE	It caused quite the stir.
CARRIE	"Will you help me patch up, buddy? I got a big tense meeting with my editor in about an hour."
CARRIE	It feels like a two-patch day.
CARRIE	You notice how much better I'm doing this time?
CARRIE	No cheating.
CARRIE	I think I finally kicked that bad habit.
CARRIE	"Now I'm practically perfect, don't you think?"
CARRIE	That kinda hurt.
CARRIE	What was that?
AIDAN	I was just making sure it was on good and tight.
CARRIE	are You mad at me Or something?
AIDAN	Why Would I be mad at you?
AIDAN	Excuse me.
CARRIE	About the other night
AIDAN	What the fuck? This goddamn milk is bad.
AIDAN	You just fucking let it sit in there?
AIDAN	"Look, it's not you."
AIDAN	I'm just a little pissed off because of work.
AIDAN	"I got to strip these pieces, the chemicals are toxic"
AIDAN	I can't get anybody to watch Pete.
CARRIE	I'll watch Pete.
AIDAN	"Come on, dog walking is not your favorite thing to do."
CARRIE	"You love Pete, I love Pete."
CARRIE	That's just the kind of girlfriend I am.
CARRIE	How 'bout I take my tall drink of water out to dinner tonight? Someplace super nice where the milk is fresh.
AIDAN	I was gonna hook up with some of my buddies over at Steve's bar.
CARRIE	"Is it a night with the guys, or can girlfriends crash?"
AIDAN	"You can come, don't come whatever, do what you like."
CARRIE	"No, you go have fun with the guys."
CARRIE	Hello?
IRANDA	my neck is out.
IRANDA	Charlotte called and I was drying my hair my whole body is fucked up because of the marathon.
CARRIE	"I'm sorry, can I do something?"
IRANDA	I don't know.
IRANDA	It hurts to even hold the phone.
IRANDA	Come over.
CARRIE	"Okay, I have a"
IRANDA	Thanks! Fuck! Shit.
CARRIE	Miranda's neck is out.
CARRIE	She can't move and I'm just I'm worried that it's too late for me to cancel my meeting.
AIDAN	I'll go check on Miranda for you.
CARRIE	You would?
AIDAN	Sure.
CARRIE	Thank you.
CARRIE	"You are a great, great boyfriend."
CARRIE	You know that?
CARRIE	"I mean it, you're the best."
AIDAN	Where are the keys?
CARRIE	Twenty minutes later Miranda's neck had gone from bad to worse.
IRANDA	Carrie?
AIDAN	"No, it's Aidan, Carrie sent me."
IRANDA	"No! No, don't come in, I'm naked!"
AIDAN	What? Jesus.
IRANDA	My neck pulled again and this is the only way I felt comfortable.
IRANDA	I'll get up.
AIDAN	"Okay, don't get up, I'm coming in."
IRANDA	"No, don't come in, I'm fine! I can't get up."
AIDAN	"Okay, I'm coming in."
IRANDA	"Oh, God."
IRANDA	I am mortified.
AIDAN	"Just relax, darling, I'm looking the other way."
AIDAN	I'm going to lift you up.
AIDAN	"No, you'll see everything."
AIDAN	"Nothing I haven't seen before, okay."
AIDAN	"Nice smell, that's the April Fresh stuff, right?"
IRANDA	Yeah.
AIDAN	All right.
AIDAN	You ready to be lifted?
IRANDA	Okay.
AIDAN	"Okay, here we go."
AIDAN	"All right, put your There you go."
AIDAN	All right.
AIDAN	"Let's get you up now, on three."
AIDAN	"One, two, three."
AIDAN	"Okay, how You doing?"
IRANDA	I'm fine.
AIDAN	Snug as a bug in a rug.
CARRIE	Samantha was right.
CARRIE	"It seemed every aspiring ""gallerina"" in New York wanted Charlotte's job."
CARRIE	She was determined to find the perfect replacement.
CARRIE	"Someone bright, someone smart someone like Charlotte."
CHARLOTTE	"""B.A."
CHARLOTTE	"In Art History, minor in Finance."
CHARLOTTE	""" Same as me."
CHARLOTTE	"""Career objectives: To own my own gallery."
CHARLOTTE	""" Oh, my God, that is amazing."
CHARLOTTE	I think I had the same objective on my first rÃ©sumÃ©.
PIA	Did you ever own one?
CHARLOTTE	No.
CHARLOTTE	"I found I loved it here so much, that it felt like my gallery."
PIA	You've done an amazing job.
PIA	It's my favorite space.
CHARLOTTE	"I probably shouldn't tell you this with a line of people out there, but you're hired."
PIA	"I am? Thank you, thank you!"
CHARLOTTE	"So, do you have any questions?"
PIA	Just one. Why are you leaving this fantastic job?
CHARLOTTE	"I'm married, and we're planning on a baby. Also I'm on the board of the Lenox Hill Pediatric AIDS Foundation."
CARRIE	Charlotte heard herself lie.
CARRIE	She just couldn't bring herself to tell the girl that her new rÃ©sumÃ© objective would read.
CARRIE	"Wife, mother, and part-time bowl glazer."
CARRIE	"That night, I decided to interrupt Guys' Night to give Aidan a quick thank-you-for-helping-Miranda kiss."
CARRIE	You're my hero.
AIDAN	"What's new, pussycat?"
CARRIE	Not only are you great to me but you're great to my friends as well.
CARRIE	Who's a better boyfriend than you?
SHAYNA	I'm back.
SHAYNA	Where were we?
AIDAN	I was up to Three peanuts.
SHAYNA	You think you're such hot stuff?
AIDAN	Yeah!
CARRIE	Peanuts?
AIDAN	"Yeah, Shayna here is teaching me how to play jacks with the peanuts."
AIDAN	I'm at three-sies.
CARRIE	"Hi, I'm Carrie."
SHAYNA	Carrie.
SHAYNA	Hi.
AIDAN	I'm sorry.
AIDAN	That's Shayna.
SHAYNA	Hi.
SHAYNA	can I get You a drink?
CARRIE	"No thanks, I'm not staying."
CARRIE	I don't want to interrupt the night with the guys.
CARRIE	"So, where are the guys?"
AIDAN	"Man, the guys blew me off at the last minute."
AIDAN	"So, I came down here to hang out with my buddy, Steve."
CARRIE	"And Steve I'm sorry, where's Steve?"
AIDAN	"It's kinda slow, so Steve went to get a burrito."
AIDAN	Shayna and I are looking out for the joint.
SHAYNA	"All right, I'm up."
SHAYNA	two-sies.
AIDAN	Two-sies!
AIDAN	Look out.
CARRIE	That was Good.
AIDAN	That was very Good.
CARRIE	"So, Miranda says that you were amazing."
CARRIE	He helped my girlfriend today.
CARRIE	He took her to the chiropractor.
SHAYNA	"we got us a Nice guy, here."
AIDAN	"Shucks, ma'am."
CARRIE	"So, how was Miranda?"
AIDAN	No work or running for a week.
AIDAN	And she has to wear one of those foam collars.
AIDAN	What do You call four?
SHAYNA	four-sies.
AIDAN	Four-sies!
CARRIE	"Okay, well, I'm gonna go."
AIDAN	"What, Yeah?"
CARRIE	Yeah.
CARRIE	Can you excuse us for a second?
SHAYNA	Sure.
CARRIE	What is going on?
AIDAN	What's up?
CARRIE	You tell me.
CARRIE	Okay you do your thing.
CARRIE	"Listen, I don't have to work tomorrow so, come on over if you want."
AIDAN	I'll come over.
CARRIE	Good luck with four-sies.
CARRIE	"It was nice to meet you, Shayna."
SHAYNA	Yeah.
CARRIE	I'll see you later.
SHAYNA	Let's go.
AIDAN	Okay.
AIDAN	"Watch and learn, young buck."
CARRIE	But Aidan never showed up.
CARRIE	And at about 3:00 am.
CARRIE	", it became very clear that I was being punished for my big mistake."
CARRIE	That cowl neck look is on the way out.
CARRIE	You heard it here first.
CARRIE	"How are you, sweetie?"
IRANDA	I had to sleep sitting up like the Elephant Man.
CARRIE	I brought you bagels to cheer you up.
IRANDA	That's so nice of you.
CARRIE	Aidan never came over last night.
CARRIE	"He said he would, but he didn't."
CARRIE	And I called him this morning.
CARRIE	"He said he thought that ""come over"" meant today not last night."
IRANDA	You know what? This is bullshit.
CARRIE	"Yeah, that's what I think."
IRANDA	
IRANDA	They're just a decoy so you could talk about Aidan.
IRANDA	You didn't even bring cream cheese.
CARRIE	I got the good bagels.
IRANDA	"It's bad enough you send your boyfriend to help me but now, the bullshit bagels!"
CARRIE	Are you saying you don't want one?
IRANDA	"If you fell or something I would never send my boyfriend to help you and yes, I know, I don't have a boyfriend."
CARRIE	What's the problem? Aidan's better in a crisis than I am.
CARRIE	I can't even remember your cream cheese.
IRANDA	He saw me naked.
IRANDA	"Your boyfriend saw me naked on the floor, lying on a bathmat! Did he tell you that?"
CARRIE	"No, he's a gentleman."
IRANDA	He did!
CARRIE	"All right, I get it, I'm sorry."
CARRIE	I will never send a boyfriend to do my job again.
IRANDA	Okay.
CARRIE	Do you want toasted?
IRANDA	Okay.
CARRIE	Lf I still even have a boyfriend.
CARRIE	I think he's having an affair with a waitress at Scout.
IRANDA	Just because you cheated on him does not mean he would cheat on you.
CARRIE	I'm gonna burn your bagel.
IRANDA	Don't.
CARRIE	"If he hasn't, it's just a matter of time."
IRANDA	He's not having an affair.
IRANDA	Aidan isn't like that.
IRANDA	He's a good guy.
CARRIE	"Yeah, he's the good guy and I'm the bad guy."
CARRIE	"And the bad guy just has to take it, right? I mean you should've seen the way he was acting in front of me."
CARRIE	He's torturing me for what I did to him.
CARRIE	And I deserve it.
CARRIE	"I deserve it, right?"
IRANDA	"I'd shrug, but it hurts."
CARRIE	Got any jelly?
BRAD	I wish I knew the name of that cab driver.
BRAD	I'd send him a bottle of wine or something.
BRAD	That was really great.
SAMANTHA	You're a wild man.
BRAD	"Yeah, speaking of wild it's getting a little too wild down there, might be time for a wax."
BRAD	See you soon.
SAMANTHA	It's my week between waxes.
SAMANTHA	I have three errant hairs and the asshole thinks I'm George of the Jungle.
CARRIE	Horrifying.
SAMANTHA	You should see the bush on him.
SAMANTHA	I need a weed whacker just to find his dick.
CARRIE	Could you please keep it down?
CARRIE	We're on the Upper East Side.
SAMANTHA	Men.
SAMANTHA	"We have to run to ""Helga the hot waxer"" every other week, but them? How would they like it if we told them to shape their hedge"
SAMANTHA	trim their trunk?
CARRIE	Plant Their bulbs?
CARRIE	"we are talking about gardening, right?"
SAMANTHA	Don't get me started on his back hair.
CARRIE	"Okay, please, wait a second, Pete has to go."
SAMANTHA	This is lovely.
SAMANTHA	Why are you even walking this mongrel?
CARRIE	Because I'm proving to my boyfriend that I am trustworthy and loving.
CARRIE	"And kindly, do not take your anger out on Pete."
SAMANTHA	"So, watching his dog take a dump is going to make the memory of Big fade away?"
CARRIE	It couldn't hurt.
SAMANTHA	come on.
SAMANTHA	"The dog, the waitress."
CARRIE	I don't know that anything happened with the waitress.
SAMANTHA	How much longer are you gonna punish yourself?
CARRIE	Until I'm back in the nook.
SAMANTHA	You may never get back in the nook.
CARRIE	Don't say that.
CARRIE	"I know it's true, but don't say it."
SAMANTHA	"I'm not a dog expert, but is that normal?"
CARRIE	No! He's got the runs.
CARRIE	poor Pete.
SAMANTHA	poor me.
CARRIE	"Oh, God! He must be sick or something."
SAMANTHA	"Honey, I love you, but this is not my scene."
SAMANTHA	I'll call you.
CARRIE	You're not gonna just leave me here?
SAMANTHA	Bye-Bye.
CARRIE	"Pete, no."
CARRIE	"Don't walk, you're not done, honey."
PEDESTRIAN	Pick up after your dog!
CARRIE	He's not my dog! It was right about then I wondered just how much shit was I willing to put up with for my mistake? Poor Pete's poo-poo platter continued for so many blocks I got worried and decided it was time to take him home.
SHAYNA	"So, I said, ""What?"""
SHAYNA	There's a big giant
CARRIE	"Here, your dog got sick, I'm leaving."
CARRIE	Taxi! Will you hold this?
AIDAN	Stop!
AIDAN	What are You doing?
CARRIE	Toxic chemicals?
AIDAN	I'm taking a break.
CARRIE	And she just happened to be there with coffee?
CARRIE	I diapered your dog!
AIDAN	Keep your voice down.
CARRIE	What are you doing?
AIDAN	Nothing.
AIDAN	It's my friend.
AIDAN	We're friends.
CARRIE	Why don't you just fuck her?
CARRIE	Then we can both be bad.
AIDAN	Nothing happened.
AIDAN	But I thought about it.
CARRIE	Do you want to come in?
AIDAN	I'm too pissed to come in.
AIDAN	I hate that he calls here.
CARRIE	Nothing's happening or will ever happen.
CARRIE	"You have to know that, right?"
CARRIE	I would never do that to you again.
CARRIE	Never.
AIDAN	I don't want you to see him ever again.
CARRIE	I can't do that.
CARRIE	He's in my life.
CARRIE	"Not the same way you are, but he is."
CARRIE	You can't keep punishing me and I can't keep punishing me.
CARRIE	I made a mistake and I am sorry.
CARRIE	And I know that you can't forget what happened but I hope that you can forgive me.
CARRIE	You have to forgive me.
CARRIE	You have to forgive me. You have to forgive me. You have to forgive me. You have to forgive me. You have to forgive me. You have to forgive me.
SAMANTHA	You had a lot of nerve telling me to get a wax.
SAMANTHA	"If you were in Aruba, the natives could bead your back."
SAMANTHA	And it's not just there.
SAMANTHA	"Every time I blow you, I feel like I'm flossing."
BRAD	"I'm sorry, baby."
BRAD	Is there anything I can do to make you forgive me?
CARRIE	Samantha forgave.
CARRIE	And Brad got a lesson he never forgot.
BRAD	Look how much bigger my dick looks!
CARRIE	"And soon, Charlotte's last day came."
CHARLOTTE	Number seven should Go on the north wall.
PIA	I think It Would be better on the South Side.
CHARLOTTE	"You're 22, what do you know about life? I mean, art, I'm sorry."
CHARLOTTE	I'm just I'm freaked out.
CHARLOTTE	I've been working my whole life.
CHARLOTTE	This is a big transition.
PIA	"If it's any consolation, my mother worked all the time."
PIA	It would've been nice to have her home more.
CHARLOTTE	Don't forget to set the alarms.
PIA	You're not going to finish the day?
CHARLOTTE	I think I'm done.
CHARLOTTE	Good luck.
CARRIE	"Charlotte left her past to pursue her new life objectives be a good mother, cure AIDS and prove Miranda wrong."
IRANDA	You better move my meetings till the end of the week.
IRANDA	I'm not quite 100 percent.
IRANDA	Yeah.
IRANDA	Still wearing the brace.
IRANDA	"Okay, bye."
CARRIE	And for the first time in her life Miranda learned the joys of cooking and of not working.
CARRIE	"Of course, she'd have to go back eventually just to prove Charlotte wrong."
CARRIE	And as for Aidan he and I weren't quite back to where we were.
CARRIE	"We might never be there again but we were in a new place, a more honest place."
CARRIE	"And somehow, over time I had made my way back into the nook."

IRANDA	And you?
CARRIE	"Okay, let's see Aidan, Aidan, this pimple, Aidan."
CARRIE	Maybe we don't need an hour.
SAMANTHA	"Charlotte, I can't believe you made this sandwich."
SAMANTHA	"I love you not working, you can be my wife."
CHARLOTTE	"I thought I'd have more free time, but redecorating is very stressful."
CHARLOTTE	Did you know there are over 40 different kinds of dimmers?
IRANDA	Remember back when the economy was good and we had a table?
IRANDA	Carrie?
CARRIE	Yeah?
IRANDA	Are you a janitor now?
CARRIE	"I know, it's ridiculous."
CARRIE	I need these seven just to get in Aidan's building.
CHARLOTTE	He gave you his keys?
CARRIE	"Yeah, but I always make him come to my place."
CARRIE	He buys that two-in-one shampoo.
IRANDA	"Does Aidan have your keys now, too?"
CARRIE	He does.
CARRIE	All two of them.
CHARLOTTE	"You exchanged keys, that's big."
CARRIE	"No, that's the opposite of Big."
IRANDA	Good for you.
IRANDA	It took me six months to give my cleaning lady a key.
SAMANTHA	I happen to have the key to a lasting relationship right here.
SAMANTHA	I got it on the corner from a guy.
SAMANTHA	1
SAMANTHA	50
SAMANTHA	I love this city.
CARRIE	"Whoa, Nellie."
CHARLOTTE	Whose legs bend back That far?
IRANDA	It's like sex for the boneless.
SAMANTHA	"See, that's what I love about this guy Nick I'm seeing."
IRANDA	He's deboned?
SAMANTHA	He's the wrestling coach at NYU and he's like an extra-strength rubber band.
CARRIE	"""My congregants, please refer ""to Position 91 in your prayer books."
IRANDA	"""And let us say, 'Amen."
CARRIE	"""' That night, I came home to find Aidan in the most shocking position of all."
CARRIE	Cooking to the oldies.
CARRIE	You're deflowering my pristine kitchen.
CARRIE	Fajitas!
AIDAN	"Meet my new George Foreman lean, mean, fat-reducing grilling machine. George, Carrie."
CARRIE	"Charmed, I'm sure."
AIDAN	"What are you doing back there, ladybird?"
CARRIE	I'm just looking for something.
AIDAN	Not in front of George.
CARRIE	Leave George out of it.
AIDAN	"Okay, that's it."
AIDAN	You're going down!
CARRIE	What about the fajitas?
AIDAN	Fuck the fajitas.
CARRIE	"If giving a man the keys to your apartment means unlocking the door to home cooking and great sex ""why were so many independent women"""

CARRIE	"Aidan, please."

CARRIE	"Me, I did, it's mine."
CARRIE	But then he did something to it.

AIDAN	I hit the Control-Alt-Delete.
DMITRI	That only works on PCs.
DMITRI	You a PC user?
DMITRI	You're not compatible.
DMITRI	Tell me exactly what happened right before you crashed.
CARRIE	I was typing and then he came over and he kissed me and then I got the bomb.

CARRIE	No.
DMITRI	Anything else before we go in?
CARRIE	"Yes! There was a mean little man who popped up and he had ""X's"" where his eyes should be."
CARRIE	And his tongue was hanging out the side of his mouth.
AIDAN	He didn't have a tongue.
CARRIE	he had a tongue.
DMITRI	That's the Sad Mac.
DMITRI	"You Sad Mac'd, you should've told me that before."
CARRIE	"Oh, my God, why? What does that mean?"
DMITRI	"Could be your motherboard, the guts of your computer."
DMITRI	It could be bad RAM.
DMITRI	"We'll keep it here for a couple of days, run some tests."
DMITRI	I'm Dmitri.
DMITRI	I'll call you if we find anything.
CARRIE	If?
DMITRI	Number 78!
CARRIE	"Oh, God, Miranda, I'm freaking out. What if everything I've ever written is gone?"
IRANDA	When was the last time you backed up?
CARRIE	"You know, no one talks about backing up."
CARRIE	You've never used that expression with me before.
CARRIE	"But apparently, everybody's secretly running home at night and backing up their work."
(P.A. SYSTEM)	Dr.
(P.A. SYSTEM)	"Adleman, please call Extension 213."
CARRIE	Where are you?
IRANDA	I'm at the hospital in Philadelphia. My mom had a heart attack.
CARRIE	"Oh, my God."
CARRIE	And you let me go on about my stupid computer?
IRANDA	"That's very upsetting, I've been through that."
CARRIE	Is she okay? How could you go to Philadelphia without telling me?
IRANDA	I had six minutes to get the train.
IRANDA	I didn't know how bad it was till I got here.
CARRIE	How bad is it?
IRANDA	They keep telling us different things. She's pretty out of it.
IRANDA	"Although, she did open her eyes just long enough to veto my lipstick."
CARRIE	Can I do anything to help? I'll jump on a train.
CARRIE	I'll come there and keep you company.
IRANDA	"No, it's fine, I'm fine."
IRANDA'S SISTER	"Miranda, the doctor is waiting."
IRANDA'S SISTER	You can't use a cell phone in the hospital.
IRANDA	She called me.
IRANDA	Great.
IRANDA	Now my sister's mad at me.
IRANDA	I gotta go.
CARRIE	"Keep me posted, all right?"
IRANDA	"Okay, bye."
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, Charlotte's afternoon was filled with ovulating and decorating."
CARRIE	She was 12 days into her cycle and three rooms into her lighting project.
CARRIE	She had become a bona fide dimmer expert.
CARRIE	Samantha called in a bona fide positions expert who came fully equipped.
CARRIE	Turns out a half nelson was very much like Position 411.
CARRIE	"One half nelson, one full orgasm."
IRANDA	"Hello? It's me, I'm sorry to wake you."
CARRIE	That's okay.
IRANDA	My mom died.
CARRIE	"Oh, my God."
IRANDA	She was stable last night.
IRANDA	And we all went home.
IRANDA	And then they called and said she was crashing.
IRANDA	"And by the time we got back, she had died."
CARRIE	"Miranda, I'm so sorry."
IRANDA	"I just wish we hadn't gone home, you know? Nobody wanted to, but they kept telling us we ought to get some sleep."
CARRIE	"I'm sure that she knew, on some level that you were with her."
IRANDA	But I wasn't with her.
IRANDA	Nobody was! What can I do?
IRANDA	"Nothing, I'm fine."
IRANDA	I'll be fine.
IRANDA	The funeral's on Tuesday and I don't have anything to wear.
IRANDA	I didn't think I would be going to a funeral while I was here.
CARRIE	"I'll be there, so I can I'll bring you something from your apartment."
IRANDA	Don't bother.
IRANDA	I'm just gonna go out and buy a shitty black dress I'll never wear again.
CARRIE	Are you sure?
CARRIE	I'd be happy to do it.
IRANDA	Don't Don't do anything.
IRANDA	I better go.
CARRIE	I'm so sorry.
IRANDA	"Thanks, I gotta go."
CARRIE	Miranda's mother died.
AIDAN	"Come here, you okay?"
CARRIE	"I'm fine, actually."
AIDAN	Do you know when the funeral is? I'd like to go if I can.
CARRIE	I don't know.
AIDAN	You don't have to.
CARRIE	I don't really know.
SAMANTHA	"Where have you been, and where's Miranda?"
SAMANTHA	I'm starving.
SAMANTHA	What's wrong?
CARRIE	Miranda's in Philadelphia.
CARRIE	"Her mother had a heart attack yesterday and she died, early this morning."
CHARLOTTE	She wasn't even sick.
CHARLOTTE	I can't believe it.
CHARLOTTE	"Poor Miranda, how is she?"
CARRIE	I don't know.
CARRIE	She's not good.
CARRIE	I just felt so awful for her and I just I didn't know what to say to her and
CARRIE	"You know Miranda, she was trying to be so strong but she sounded so alone."
CARRIE	"And I just kept saying all the wrong things, I think."
CHARLOTTE	I'm sure you didn't.
CHARLOTTE	here.
CARRIE	"Thanks, I'm sorry."
CHARLOTTE	I guess the first thing we should do is send some flowers.
CARRIE	Right.
CHARLOTTE	Or a fruit basket.
CHARLOTTE	"Or muffins, what do you think? You all right?"
SAMANTHA	What? I'm fine.
SAMANTHA	"Flowers are fine, just tell me who to send the check to."
SAMANTHA	I'm just hungry.
CARRIE	"After breakfast, Charlotte showed her support for Miranda by becoming the Martha Stewart of death."
CHARLOTTE	I want the clear cellophane and the navy ribbon.
CHARLOTTE	"Samantha, have you called Miranda yet?"
CHARLOTTE	She thinks it'd be faster for us to take the train to Philadelphia and I agree.
SAMANTHA	We're going to the funeral? I thought we were just sending flowers.
CHARLOTTE	Of course we're going to the funeral and you should call her.
CHARLOTTE	I think she'd really like to hear from you.
SAMANTHA	What am I gonna say to her?
CHARLOTTE	"You could say, ""I'm so sorry for your loss. ""I love you, I'm here for you."
CHARLOTTE	""" That's enough ribbon."
CHARLOTTE	"""You're in my thoughts."
CHARLOTTE	"""May she rest in peace, I'm so sorry you lost"""
SAMANTHA	"Fine, I'll call her, good-bye."
CARRIE	"In times of sorrow, some people have trouble reaching out."
CARRIE	Samantha wasn't one of those people.
SAMANTHA	Wanna wrestle?
SAMANTHA	Keep doing that!
CARRIE	But today something was just out of reach. So they tried another position.
CARRIE	299
THE WRESTLING COACH	I'm almost there.
SAMANTHA	Just hang on one more second.
SAMANTHA	"Hang on, hang in there."
SAMANTHA	"Keep hanging on, stay with me."
SAMANTHA	Stay just like that.
SAMANTHA	Get 'em off me!
SAMANTHA	You're distracting me.
CARRIE	And when none of those worked they went back to Old Faithful.
CARRIE	Number 17.
SAMANTHA	"Okay, now that's it."
SAMANTHA	Now we got it.
SAMANTHA	Here we go.
SAMANTHA	Home free.
SAMANTHA	Just keep doing exactly what you're doing.
SAMANTHA	Exactly what you're doing.
SAMANTHA	Don't stop.
THE WRESTLING COACH	I gotta pick up my stuff at the cleaners by 5:00.
SAMANTHA	"Okay, stop."
CHARLOTTE	"I want you to make it very clear to the Philadelphia florist Tasteful, all white."
CHARLOTTE	"The Casablanca lilies, the calla lilies and the Phalaenopsis."
CHARLOTTE	I don't want any crap.
CARRIE	You told her.
CHARLOTTE	These flowers will be the centerpiece on the church altar.
CHARLOTTE	"It's important that they represent us, don't you agree?"
SAMANTHA	"I don't know, I'm not even listening."
SAMANTHA	I lost my orgasm.
CARRIE	In the cab?
CARRIE	"What do you mean, ""lost""?"
SAMANTHA	"I mean, I just spent the last two hours fucking with no finale."
CARRIE	It happens.
CARRIE	Sometimes you just can't get there.
SAMANTHA	I can always get there.
CHARLOTTE	Every time you have sex?
CARRIE	She's exaggerating.
CARRIE	Please say you're exaggerating.
SAMANTHA	"I'll admit I have had to polish myself off once or twice, but yes."
SAMANTHA	When I R.S.V.P.
SAMANTHA	"To a party, I make it my business to come."
CARRIE	"See, I've been a no-show on more than one occasion."
CHARLOTTE	Sex can still be great without an orgasm.
SAMANTHA	That is such a crock of shit.
CARRIE	She has a point.
SAMANTHA	What's wrong with me?
CARRIE	Listen!
CARRIE	You've got plenty of orgasms under your belt.
CARRIE	You're gonna be fine.
CARRIE	"Now, let's retrace your steps."
CARRIE	Were you on top?
SAMANTHA	How is that relevant?
CHARLOTTE	You can have them on the bottom?
SAMANTHA	"Top, bottom, upside-down."
CARRIE	"All right, now you're just showing off."
SAMANTHA	I'm asking for help!
CARRIE	Sweetie I'm sure it will pop up when you least expect it.
CARRIE	Like jury duty.
SAMANTHA	Unless
SAMANTHA	what?
CHARLOTTE	I read this article about a woman who's having orgasms around the clock.
CHARLOTTE	"And then, boom! Orgasms stopped for good."
CHARLOTTE	It was like she had used them all up or something.
SAMANTHA	That's the meanest thing you've ever said to me.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile in Philadelphia, Miranda realized she needed a shitty black bra to go with her shitty black dress."
LUCILLE	Can I help you find something?
IRANDA	"No, I'm looking for this in 36A in black."
LUCILLE	You don't look like a 36A to me.
IRANDA	I am.
IRANDA	Excuse me? Lucille? I've been a 36A my whole life.
IRANDA	I think I know what size I am.
LUCILLE	Didn't think so.
LUCILLE	try these.
IRANDA	There is no way that I'm a 34B.
LUCILLE	Just try them.
LUCILLE	How's it going in there?
IRANDA	Everything's fine.
CARRIE	"From the age of 14, Miranda had a strict ""no visitors"" policy in the dressing room."
LUCILLE	Let's see how that's working out.
CARRIE	"Although her mother never observed it, and neither did Lucille."
IRANDA	I just said that I didn't need any help.
LUCILLE	"You say you don't want help, but you were picking out the wrong size."
LUCILLE	"See, this one fits you."
IRANDA	I think that I can adjust my bra straps by myself.
IRANDA	Would you please get your hands off of my breasts?
LUCILLE	I'm not being fresh.
LUCILLE	I think I know what's best.
IRANDA	You don't! I think that I know what's best for me!
CARRIE	Suddenly Miranda realized she would never have a fight with her mother again.
IRANDA	"I'm sorry, it's not you."
IRANDA	"My mother just died, and"
LUCILLE	come here.
IRANDA	"No, I'm fine, I I'm"
CARRIE	"And there, behind the curtain, when no one was looking Miranda found a kind of support that actually fit her."
IRANDA	This is perfect.
IRANDA	You were right.
IRANDA	Thanks.
AIDAN	Wait!
AIDAN	"Damn, you're always sneaking up on me."
AIDAN	Surprise! It's your new computer.
CARRIE	It's blue.
AIDAN	Yeah.
AIDAN	It's a lot more fun than your old one.
AIDAN	"It's got this handle, so it's like a little purse."
CARRIE	That's a very expensive purse.
CARRIE	when did You get that?
AIDAN	Today.
AIDAN	And I got you one of these Zip drives so you can start backing up your work now.
CARRIE	"I don't even know how to use that and I don't need it, I have my own system."
CARRIE	Works Just Fine.
AIDAN	Right.
AIDAN	You sure about that?
CARRIE	I am.
CARRIE	I'm not ready for a new computer.
CARRIE	I'm still waiting to hear back about my old one.
CARRIE	My whole life was on that computer.
AIDAN	I get it.
AIDAN	It's all you.
AIDAN	I'm not a part of any of this.
AIDAN	You don't want the laptop.
AIDAN	You don't want me to go to the funeral.
AIDAN	"I feel like I gave you my keys, what more do you want?"
AIDAN	"Your keys? Great, now I can get into your front door."
AIDAN	How do I get into there?
CARRIE	"I'm sorry, but I've been taking care of myself for a really long time."
AIDAN	"You may not like it, but this is how I deal with things."
AIDAN	This is your receipt.
AIDAN	"So you can do whatever you want with that computer, all right?"
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, Samantha was troubleshooting her own laptop."
CARRIE	She was determined to just relax unwind and let the rest of the world fall away.
SAMANTHA	what?
CHARLOTTE	"Good, you're there."
CHARLOTTE	I'm picking up bagels for the train ride.
CHARLOTTE	"Sesame, right? And have you called Miranda yet? I'm whole wheat and I haven't called her because I don't want to bother her."
SAMANTHA	I'm masturbating.
SAMANTHA	I told you I'd be doing that all day today.
CARRIE	"By nightfall, Samantha called off the search party."
CARRIE	Somewhere in the city of lost dreams and missing persons Samantha's orgasm remained at large.
CARRIE	"The next morning, my own search party called with news of a breakthrough."
DMITRI	Hi.
CARRIE	"You remember me? I'm Number P438W, you have my computer."
DMITRI	Yep.
DMITRI	Okay.
DMITRI	And here's what we could recover from your hard drive.
DMITRI	Any of that look familiar to you?
CARRIE	"There it was, my past. It was a mess."
CARRIE	Can you please tell me why this happened in the first place?
DMITRI	We don't know.
DMITRI	"Sometimes these things, they just crash."
DMITRI	We can replace your motherboard but you have to get yourself a backup system.
DMITRI	"Pick out a Zip drive, start saving."
DMITRI	"Next time, you won't lose everything."
DMITRI	Ouch.
DMITRI	"You saved your warranty, right?"
CARRIE	"Hello, furniture company."
CARRIE	"It's me, the girl who doesn't back up."
CARRIE	This is my attempt to breathe and reboot.
CARRIE	Are you smiling at all over there?
AIDAN	I'm listening.
CARRIE	Okay I'm just on my way to Philly and I just wanted to say that I'm sorry.
CARRIE	This is hard.
AIDAN	We're gonna run into stuff that's hard.
AIDAN	That's why I was trying to help.
CARRIE	I know that but if you start helping me and then I get used to having that help
AIDAN	Yeah?
CARRIE	No good can come of that.
CARRIE	"I mean, then what happens when, you know you're not around one day?"
AIDAN	where am I going?
CARRIE	I don't know.
CARRIE	You could be out of town or be busy or
CARRIE	Things fall apart.
CARRIE	We could fall apart.
AIDAN	I know that.
CARRIE	Then what?
AIDAN	Then I guess we'd be a couple of Sad Macs.
CARRIE	Philadelphia.
CARRIE	"Just a hop, a skip, a cab, a metroliner and another cab away."
SAMANTHA	I'm not gonna find my orgasm in this town.
CHARLOTTE	We are at a funeral.
IRANDA	Be right back.
CARRIE	I'm so sorry.
CHARLOTTE	I'm so sorry.
SAMANTHA	You look great.
SAMANTHA	She does.
CARRIE	how are you?
IRANDA	I'm fine.
IRANDA	But everybody else is very concerned about me because I'm here alone.
IRANDA	I didn't realize I needed a date for my mother's funeral.
IRANDA	"My sister and her husband want me to third-wheel with them down the aisle God forbid that I should walk it alone because that would be the real tragedy, right? Ignore the coffin."
IRANDA	There's a single 35-year-old woman walking behind it.
(FEMALE)	Miranda?
IRANDA	"Coming, Betsy."
CHARLOTTE	This is hard.
CHARLOTTE	"""You look great""?"
CHARLOTTE	That was not one of the things I told you to say.
CHARLOTTE	"Excuse me, Betsy? Hi, I'm Charlotte, we spoke on the phone."
CHARLOTTE	I just wanted to say again how sorry I am.
CHARLOTTE	And to make sure that everything worked out with the flowers.
BETSY	"Yes, thank you."
BETSY	"In fact, there they are now."
CHARLOTTE	I said tasteful!
CARRIE	I think now we know what $500 worth of glitter looks like.
INISTER	Death is the eternal mystery.
INISTER	It defies our comprehension.
INISTER	"There are no explanations, no answers."
INISTER	No magic words to soothe us.
CARRIE	"You're a spiritual leader, can't you make something up?"
CHARLOTTE	"Those flowers were supposed to say: ""We're so sorry, we love you."" Not ""you're dead, let's disco."
INISTER	""" so many wonderful stories about her from her daughter Betsy and her husband, David her son John and his wife, Miranda her daughter Catherine Did he just say No spiritual stuff and he can't keep the family tree straight? This guy's a hack."
INISTER	"Sara, Alexandra, Nathan, and little Emily."
INISTER	"After the burial John and his wife, Miranda, invite you back to their home."
INISTER	Directions can be found as you exit the sanctuary.
SAMANTHA	I'm sorry.
IRANDA	Thank you.
CARRIE	"Finally, Samantha found the release she really needed."
CARRIE	She cried for everything she couldn't say and for things she didn't even know she felt.
CARRIE	It's okay.
CARRIE	There's the kind of support you ask for and a kind of support you don't ask for.
CARRIE	And then there's the kind that just shows up.
CARRIE	Thank you.
CARRIE	"After all, computers crash, people die relationships fall apart."
CARRIE	The best we can do is breathe and reboot.
CARRIE	And when that fails a little gizmo called a Zip drive can provide a surprising amount of comfort.
CARRIE	So can a boyfriend.
CARRIE	If you can learn to let him
CARRIE	"For most New Yorkers, Manhattan is the center of the civilized world. But for a privileged few, Manhattan is merely a place to kill time between weekends at their fashionably rustic New York country homes."
CARRIE	"Wow, yeah, the place looks great."
CARRIE	I was willing to forgo the privilege.
AIDAN	That's the ''before'' picture.
CARRIE	Sorry.
AIDAN	That's the after.
CARRIE	Could I see the before again?
AIDAN	You kinda have to be There to appreciate it.
CARRIE	"No, I can appreciate It from here."
AIDAN	"Luckily you won't have to, since you're coming up there with me next week."
CARRIE	"I am? Man, I wish I could. But I have a meeting with my editor in town next week."
AIDAN	"That's all right, it's only 40 minutes away. You take the train in for your meeting. Then right back out when you're done."
CARRIE	"You've just thought of everything, haven't you?"
AIDAN	"Pack your bags, little lady. You're coming to the country with me."
CARRIE	"That's Miranda, I gotta go. We'll talk about this later."
AIDAN	Nothing left to talk about.
CARRIE	"Yes, there is. I'll be right down."
IRANDA	I'm coming up.
CARRIE	See...I'm what you call a bona fide city girl. I'm a girl about town. I'm the kind of girl that goes to a late movie in the middle of the week. I'm crazy.
AIDAN	I know it.
IRANDA	"Hi, there."
AIDAN	Hello.
IRANDA	"Could you tell your little pal, Steve, to call his insurance company? They can't find him and they think that I'm his in-case-of-emergency person. So, he needs to update that whole file."
AIDAN	"I know he wants to talk to You about some stuff, too."
IRANDA	like what?
AIDAN	some stuff.
IRANDA	"No, what is he gonna tell me? Now that Jessica's gone, he wants to start seeing me again? That he can't stop thinking about me? That he's still in love with me?"
AIDAN	Steve's got testicular cancer.
IRANDA	"That I'm a horrible, selfish bitch?"
CARRIE	"Several blocks south, Charlotte also found herself in a compromising position."
TREY	"Whatever it is you're doing, don't stop."
CHARLOTTE	It's a fertility exercise.
TREY	I know a better one.
CHARLOTTE	"No, not yet. My basal body temperature reading says I won't be ovulating for another five days."
TREY	Perfect. That means we have five days of practice to get it right.
CHARLOTTE	"No, we can't. You need to conserve your juices till then, so they'll be at their most powerful."
TREY	"Darling, I'm juicy now."
CHARLOTTE	"I'm sorry, it's just... we've been trying for three months, and I don't wanna take any chances. Can't it wait until Saturday?"
TREY	We're gonna be in Connecticut on Saturday. We promised mother.
CHARLOTTE	I know. But I was thinking maybe we could stay here and concentrate on this.
TREY	"She's expecting us. We miss the orchid show, she'll be devastated."
CHARLOTTE	Then I guess we'll just have to have sex at your mother's.
TREY	People having sex in Connecticut? There's a first time for everything.
STEVE	"It's no big deal. The doctor said it's very trendy now. Lance Armstrong had it, the Drew Barry-more guy."
IRANDA	Everybody's getting it. It's the TiVo of cancers.
STEVE	"That's right, it's no big deal. He's just gotta get in there and snip one of those guys out of there and I'm done."
IRANDA	"Good, so, then it's stage one, right? I looked it up on the net."
STEVE	"Yeah, I Guess so."
IRANDA	You guess so? You don't know?
STEVE	"What? Sure, stage one, you have the operation."
IRANDA	"No, stage one, the cancer hasn't spread to the lymph nodes. Has it? Your doctor gave you an ultrasound, right? A CAT scan?"
STEVE	"You know, I mean... I turned my head, I coughed. He poked around a little."
IRANDA	Who the hell is this doctor? Has he got a storefront outside Port Authority?
STEVE	"No, he's nice. I got him through my HMO."
IRANDA	"Then he must be good. Steve, look... I talked to some guys in my office who have been through this."
STEVE	Miranda.
IRANDA	"Don't worry, I used a pseudonym. They gave me the name of a specialist at Beth Israel."
STEVE	"You don't have to do that. You don't have to do anything. I have a doctor, it's no big deal."
IRANDA	"Will you stop saying that? It is a big deal! This isn't your crazy yellow toenail. This is cancer. The longer you wait to find out what's going on, the longer we sit here having this conversation, the more likely it is that the cancer will spread and that you will die. It is a big fucking deal!"
STEVE	All right.
IRANDA	"I made him cry. No, first, I yelled at him. I yelled at my friend, the cancer patient. Then I made him cry."
CHARLOTTE	"It's understandable. I mean, you just lost your mom. I'm sure you have a lot of pent up, residual anger."
IRANDA	"Maybe, but mostly he was just pissing me off."
SAMANTHA	"Sounds like he needed the good kick in the ass, which you gave him."
CARRIE	"You know what you need? A nice, relaxing weekend with me at Aidan's country house."
SAMANTHA	"You're not actually going, are you?"
CARRIE	"If by ''going'' you mean being taken against my will and kidnapped, then yes, I'm going. So, enjoy me now, ladies. Because this weekend I'm a hick town hostage."
IRANDA	"I can't go, Steve has cancer. Somebody has to stay in town and make him feel bad about it."
CARRIE	You're at the Connecticut compound? Come on! It's like we're living in Paris and running off to Provence for the weekend.
SAMANTHA	"What is it about the weekends now? I swear to God, every guy I've fucked since Memorial Day wants to know what I'm doing this weekend. They just don't get it. My weekends are for meeting new guys, so I don't have to fuck the old ones."
CARRIE	"That's a no, I guess? I guess I'll have to brave the wilderness on my own."
CHARLOTTE	"No. Not on your own, with Aidan."
CARRIE	And I love Aidan. And Aidan loves the country. Maybe I'll love the country.
IRANDA	"Wait a minute. Just because Aidan loves the country, you have to love it, too?"
CARRIE	Apparently that's how it works.
IRANDA	I see. You need to pretend to be someone else to be in a relationship.
CARRIE	"No, I believe the word you're looking for is ''compromise.''"
CHARLOTTE	"It's true. Trey loves golf, so, I'm taking golf lessons. Trey loves Bunny, so, I'm ovulating at the orchid show."
SAMANTHA	Which hick town is it exactly?
CARRIE	"It's too terrible and too ironic. It's Suffern. Suffern, New York."
IRANDA	Sounds like you better take some Buffern to Suffern.
AIDAN	"Well? There's a lake right over there. One mile. This floor's all original. Dates back to 1874. The plumbing's 1974, so, of course, it needs work. But I put in a hot water heater all by myself. What do you think? Scary as you thought it'd be?"
CARRIE	"No. God, no."
CARRIE	It was scarier.
AIDAN	Good. Let me stick this stuff in the back. And I'll give you the grand tour.
CARRIE	I'll be here.
CARRIE	"So, there I was... trapped in a cabin that was outdated even by CiviI War standards when I could've been out cocktailing and sample saleing."
CARRIE	"Oh, God!"
AIDAN	What is it? What happened? Are you ok?
CARRIE	"No! Oh, my God! There was a huge, giant squirrel in that window, right there."
AIDAN	"That's my squirrel. I've been sneaking little nuts out there. Hoping he'd come make friends, and he did."
CARRIE	You can't be friends with a squirrel. A squirrel is just a rat with a cuter outfit.
AIDAN	Is that right?
CARRIE	'That's my squirrel''? Any more Wild Kingdom surprises I should know about?
AIDAN	"Let's see, just..."
CARRIE	"Hours later, we discovered one satisfying way to pass the time in the country. Just not enough time. There I was, miles from home, hours from sleep with no one to talk to, nowhere to go, and nothing to do except.... Three hours, two mosquitoes, and one too many Vodka KooIAids later. I finally found an outlet for my computer, but not my frustration."
CARRIE	"Relationships, no matter how good, are inevitably a series of compromises. But how much of ourselves should we be willing to sacrifice for the other person before we stop being ourselves?"
CARRIE	"In a relationship, when does the art of compromise become compromising?"
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, back at the center of the civilized world..."
STUD	"So, what are you doing next weekend?"
STUD	What did I say?
CARRIE	"Tired of being the ''wake up and smell the coffee'' girl, Miranda invited Steve over for tea and sympathy. Or in Steve's case, Chinese food and Chop Socky."
STEVE	I thought you hated these movies.
IRANDA	"Yeah, but you don't. And the guy at Video Village said this one rocks, so... You want the last spring roll?"
STEVE	"No, that's yours."
IRANDA	"No, I don't want it. You have it. Shit! They forgot the tea. Did you want tea? I can make some."
STEVE	"That's it, I'm out of here."
IRANDA	"Why, where are You going?"
STEVE	"Home. You think I wanna stay here, and be treated like some fuckin' cancer patient?"
IRANDA	What are you talking about?
STEVE	Since when don't you want the last spring roll? You usually eat all these spring roll. I'm lucky if I see a spring roll.
IRANDA	"I'm sorry, I felt bad. In the park, you needed a shoulder to cry on. And I was a total bitch to you."
STEVE	"Yeah, you were. You know what, thank God, because now I have a doctor who knows what he's doing. I scheduled my operation, and I have insurance that's gonna pay for it. So, thank you for being a huge bitch. Give me that spring roll."
CARRIE	"The next day at the MacDougal's Connecticut compound, Bunny gave Charlotte a tour of her nursery."
BUNNY	"Since my boys have all grown up, my orchids have become my babies. And this year, Waxie Hanahan's Chocolate Oncidium will be no match for my Rising Suns."
CHARLOTTE	They're exquisite.
BUNNY	"I'm pleased you think so, Charlotte. I've repotted this one for you to take home."
CHARLOTTE	"No, I couldn't."
BUNNY	But I insist. A gift in anticipation of the great gift you're giving me.
CHARLOTTE	What gift is that?
BUNNY	"Why, a grandchild, my dear. You mustn't be cross with Trey for telling me. He knows how anxious I am to have a wee MacDougal to carry on the family name."
CARRIE	I couldn't get any sleep at all last night. The silence out here is deafening.
CHARLOTTE	You are in the country.
CARRIE	"Then I go to take a shower and there's no water. So, now, he's working on the pipes all day, so I finally had to leave the house before I dehydrated."
CASHIER	Welcome to Frozen Cup.
CARRIE	"Yes, I'd like a cheeseburger, please, large fries, and a Cosmopolitan?"
CASHIER	what?
CARRIE	"a strawberry shake, please."
CHARLOTTE	Where are you?
CARRIE	"I'm at the Frozen Cup in HoHoKus. I had to freaking drive to New Jersey to get cell service, and apparently, the only way to get anything to eat in the country is to make it yourself. I'm in no mood for Bisquick."
CHARLOTTE	It could be worse. Bunny's already picking out names and schools for her grandchild. I'm not even pregnant yet. She wouldn't even let the cook put shrimp in my omelet this morning.
CARRIE	You have a cook? How far is my country from your country?
CHARLOTTE	How is the house?
CARRIE	"What house? He's got squirrels running in here and there. It's Animal Farm. Four legs good, two legs bad."
CHARLOTTE	"You didn't say that to him, did you?"
CARRIE	No. He thinks I love it. I don't even know what I'm doing out here.
CHARLOTTE	You're keeping him company.
CARRIE	"I'm trying, but he's out there hoeing."
CHARLOTTE	"So, try harder, Go hoe."
CARRIE	All Right.
CARRIE	"So, what are we gonna be doing? Are we gonna be schlepping these railroad ties over to the mudhole?"
AIDAN	Yes. Ma'am.
CARRIE	"All righty, then."
AIDAN	Don't hurt yourself.
CARRIE	I'm not gonna hurt myself.
AIDAN	"All Right, You ready? here You go."
AIDAN	You ok?
CARRIE	"I'm fine, it's just mud."
AIDAN	oK.
CARRIE	"Oh, God. Ok, go! Shit!"
CARRIE	"Ok, I'm not being helpful anymore. I think I should get back to the city. I have that meeting to get ready for. And several showers to take."
CARRIE	"Four hours later, I kissed Aidan goodbye, kicked the mud off my boots, and had a New York steak with my New York ex."
CARRIE	"I tried, I really did, but nature and me... it's unnatural. And I love being with Aidan. I mean, there's no one in the world that I would rather be... I'm sorry. Is it ok to talk to you about this stuff?"
BIG	"Go ahead, I'm ok."
CARRIE	"Good. I'm glad that we can talk about this stuff. And listen, if you ever meet someone, I want you to feel..."
BIG	I met someone.
CARRIE	"So, who is she?"
BIG	"If I tell you, you can't tell anyone."
CARRIE	is she your imaginary girlfriend?
BIG	She's an actress. Willow Summers.
CARRIE	"She's not an actress, she's a movie star."
BIG	Did you see that Spy GirI movie? I thought she was pretty good.
CARRIE	I don't know about that. I do know she wears many wrong things on the red carpet. I cannot believe you are dating... someone named after a tree.
BIG	She's really something.
CARRIE	how did You meet her?
BIG	"She came up to me at her premiere thing and asked for a light and said, ''I have two vices, smoking and green-eyed men.''"
CARRIE	She's a smoothie.
BIG	"We talked, had a few... went up to her hotel... dress comes off... red panties. Kept her high heels on. I lifted her up, I put her on the bed..."
CARRIE	"Ok, that's plenty. Thanks. That was about 30 seconds. I think I did pretty good. How's the stock market treating you these days?"
BIG	"The thing of it is, I can't get her out of my head. She's crazy about me. Willow Summers is crazy about me."
CARRIE	Someone's crazy.
BIG	I'm not kidding. When I walked home from her hotel...
CARRIE	You walked?
BIG	"Yeah. I thought, this is something. There's something here, a connection."
CARRIE	"Yeah, the Red panty, green-eyed connection."
BIG	Fuck. I think I'm in love.
CARRIE	"As I walked off my Big dinner, I realized I'd gone from pretending I didn't hate being in the country to pretending I didn't hate listening to Big's Willow talk. I may have been back in the city, but now I was really suffering. One thing was clear. I had to get back to the country. But this time, I wouldn't rely on the country to provide the entertainment. I would take the entertainment with me. Otherwise known as Samantha."
CARRIE	"What's next, Samantha?"
SAMANTHA	You've got to be kidding me.
CARRIE	Come on. We're baking a pie here.
SAMANTHA	You're baking a pie. I'm just baking. It's hotter here than it is outside. Can't we turn on the air conditioning or something?
CARRIE	"One cup of milk. No, we can't. There is no air conditioner. Or milk for that matter."
SAMANTHA	What time's the next train?
CARRIE	"No, you can't go. You have to entertain me when Aidan goes to bed in an hour."
SAMANTHA	You lured me here under false pretenses.
CARRIE	I told You That It was rustic.
SAMANTHA	"Honey, don't kid yourself. It's a dump."
CARRIE	Aidan worked very hard on this place. Did you know that he put that hot water heater in all by himself? With his own bare hands.
AIDAN	"Actually, I was wearing gloves at the time, but thanks for the shout out. Is it hot in here or is it just me?"
SAMANTHA	It isn't you.
CARRIE	I'm preheating the oven.
SAMANTHA	It couldn't be any hotter in here. Or could it? Who's the farmer with the delts?
CARRIE	young McDonald?
SAMANTHA	E-I-E-I-O!
AIDAN	"That's Luke Gilmore. Came out here from the city after the last big market crash. He doesn't say much, kinda keeps to himself."
CARRIE	"So, What Does he do out here?"
SAMANTHA	"Pushups, by the look Of him."
CARRIE	"Oh, no. What are you up to, SammyJo?"
SAMANTHA	"Honey, if we're gonna bake us a pie, we're gonna need us some milk."
SAMANTHA	Anybody home?
FARMER LUKE	You lost?
SAMANTHA	"No. I'm staying next door, and I'm baking a pie from scratch. And I suddenly realized... fresh out of milk."
FARMER LUKE	help yourself. You from New York City?
SAMANTHA	Yes. But Only until I can afford a little farm All my own.
FARMER LUKE	ever milk a cow before?
SAMANTHA	No. But something tells me I'd be very good at it.
FARMER LUKE	Squeeze off the milk with your thumb and forefinger. Then roll down into a fist. Squeeze and roll.
SAMANTHA	Squeeze and roll. I think I can do that. Squeeze and roll. Squeeze... I usually get a little warning before that happens. I guess it just takes practice. Anything else around here need milking?
CARRIE	While Samantha worked up an appetite...
CHARLOTTE	"Trey, are you up here?"
CARRIE	...Charlotte's eggs were ready.
TREY	In the bath.
CHARLOTTE	"It's time. I'm ovulating. So, get out of the tub, get into this bed, and make love to me right now!"
BUNNY	"Charlotte, I was just telling Trey how much you remind me of myself at your age."
TREY	There You are.
TREY	What are you doing in here?
CHARLOTTE	What were You doing up there?
TREY	up Where? What do You mean?
CHARLOTTE	What do I mean? your Mother was watching You bathe.
TREY	She was not. We were having a conversation while I was in the bath.
CHARLOTTE	"I don't know how you were brought up. But that is not acceptable parent child bath time behavior past the age of 5! Even 4 in some cases. lf you think that I'm bringing a child into that, that I will be that kind of mother, then you better think again. She may have raised you like that, but I am not your mother."
TREY	"I was raised by a woman named Eva Neal. She was my nanny. I don't remember ever seeing my mother ever, except after her tennis lesson and before the cocktail hour when she would draw me a bath and tell me how she'd spent her day. So, I know, I have always known that you could never ever be that kind of mother."
CHARLOTTE	That's my ovaries. I'm ovulating.
TREY	We'd better get to work.
CHARLOTTE	"Ok, but I have to get in the right position. Wait, stop, not like that. I have to get my legs up."
CARRIE	"While trying to make a baby, Charlotte and Trey accidentally destroyed Bunny's, and Waxie Hanahan's Chocolate Oncidium won first prize for the second year in a row."
CARRIE	"Back in New York, the patient Steve was greeted by a patient Miranda."
IRANDA	You're up. How are you?
STEVE	on drugs. how long You been here?
IRANDA	not long. a while. is That OK? I...I talked to the doctor.
STEVE	"Yeah, how's he?"
STEVE	"He said everything looked pretty good down there. I told him, frankly, I'd seen better."
NURSE	Sorry. Visiting hours are over. You're going to have to leave now.
IRANDA	"No, I'm sorry, I don't think so."
NURSE	are You a family member?
IRANDA	I'm his in-case-of-emergency person.
STEVE	"It's oK, Miranda, if You Wanna go."
IRANDA	Shut up or I'll give you a sponge bath.
NURSE	Twenty minutes.
IRANDA	Drink your juice.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, on his farm, Young McDonald had Samantha."
FARMER LUKE	That was Good.
SAMANTHA	"You're a man of few words, but they're all the right ones."
FARMER LUKE	What are you doing next weekend?
CARRIE	Look! I made crust! Now all we have to do is put apples in and it's pie.
AIDAN	Look at that.
CARRIE	"No, you don't understand. The only thing that I have ever successfully made in the kitchen is a mess. And several little fires. Come on, you feel like peeling some apples?"
AIDAN	I feel like taking a shower.
CARRIE	"Now? No! You've been outside all day, and I've been cooped up in here. Look, we'll do it together. lt'll be fun, all right? Oh, god. Damn it."
AIDAN	It's a squirrel! Are you ok?
CARRIE	"No, I am not ok! I burned my legs! And I... God! I hate that squirrel! I hate this oven! I hate this!"
AIDAN	"House, just say it, you hate the house."
CARRIE	I hate the house.
AIDAN	Thank you.
CARRIE	"I'm sorry, I just... I don't belong here. I don't know where anything goes and I burned my legs. It really hurts."
AIDAN	"Come here. Jump up here. Come on. Where is it? Oh, there it is. Is that better?"
CARRIE	I'm sorry. I don't hate the house. I hate the squirrel.
AIDAN	"The squirrel's not so bad. The house, it'll get better. You'll see."
CARRIE	Maybe from now on I should just come on the weekends.
AIDAN	"Yeah, Or every other weekend."
CARRIE	I don't have to come at all.
AIDAN	oK.
CARRIE	Weekends are Good.
CARRIE	One slow train ride and two fast-food apple pies later...
SAMANTHA	These are surprisingly delicious.
CARRIE	"I know. Why would anybody go to the trouble of making one when you can buy one that's so perfect, and individually sized? Wait a minute, hold still, sweetie."
SAMANTHA	what?
CARRIE	Souvenir?
SAMANTHA	"Please, I am never leaving this city again."
CARRIE	"Taxi! Actually, the country's looking pretty good to me right about now."
SAMANTHA	"Really, so you'll be back next weekend?"
CARRIE	"not Next weekend, no."
SAMANTHA	"So, when are You going back?"
CARRIE	You gonna finish That pie?
CARRIE	"In the end, of course, Aidan and I compromised. He spent money on air conditioning. And I spent enough time in Suffern to realize that city girls are just country girls... with cuter outfits."
CARRIE	There are a million reasons to celebrate in New York City: Steve no longer having testicular cancer was just one of them.
SAMANTHA	I Only have one ball left.
AIDAN	I don't care who wins. It's me and you after this.
SAMANTHA	It All comes down to Just one little ball.
STEVE	who wants a beer?
IRANDA	Samantha. one ball? one ball?
SAMANTHA	I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking. Was he upset?
AIDAN	"Embarrassed, I think."
IRANDA	There's nothing to be embarrassed about. He's still got one.
CARRIE	"Miranda, they come in a set like earrings."
AIDAN	"He's doing great. If it were me, I'd be sitting at home depressed."
IRANDA	Explain that to me. Tell me why you'd be depressed if you were perfectly healthy but had to go through life without balls?
SAMANTHA	well.
IRANDA	I was talking to Aidan.
AIDAN	"Maybe it's bullshit, but I might feel less of a man or something."
IRANDA	A couple of hanging glands has nothing to do with making somebody a man.
SAMANTHA	She's right. I once went out with a guy with the biggest balls I've seen. Complete pussy.
AIDAN	how big?
SAMANTHA	Huge. I Could barely fit one in my mouth.
CARRIE	Welcome to my world.
IRANDA	"The irony is I don't think women care that much about balls. I know I don't. Do you, Carrie?"
CARRIE	"Except for yours, darling. I'm very into yours."
SAMANTHA	"I have never met a man who wasn't into his balls. ""Oh yeah, baby, that's it. Grab my big balls. Lick them, pull them."""
IRANDA	You pull the balls?
SAMANTHA	they like it. I went out with this guy...
CARRIE	I'm sure you did.
AIDAN	Wait. Please let her finish.
CARRIE	"She's done. Now, I'm thinking balls are to men what purses are to women. It's just a little bag but we'd feel naked in public without it."
ALLAN JANNIS	Samantha Jones.
SAMANTHA	how are you?
ALLAN JANNIS	Great!
SAMANTHA	"Everyone, this is..."
ALLAN JANNIS	Allan Jannis.
SAMANTHA	"Allan Jannis, right, we..."
ALLAN JANNIS	Fucked!
SAMANTHA	
ALLAN JANNIS	Not bad. Just designed the new Richard hotel.
SAMANTHA	I've been trying to get a meeting with him for months. Who's doing his P.R.?
ALLAN JANNIS	I think he's talking to Brad Rosen.
SAMANTHA	He's a hack. Get me a meeting?
ALLAN JANNIS	I'll do what I can.
SAMANTHA	Good seeing you...
ALLAN JANNIS	Allan.
SAMANTHA	I know!
CARRIE	"And up on Park Avenue, a different reason for celebrating."
TREY	"So, I told him, when I hire a contractor to do a job, I expect him to finish on time."
CHARLOTTE	"Good, honey, good! Sometimes they just need to hear it from a man."
TREY	"A little more Mu Shu, my Mu Shu."
CHARLOTTE	I saw my doctor today and I told her how frustrated we were that we weren't pregnant yet.
CHARLOTTE	Wonton?
CHARLOTTE	She said that the easiest thing to do would be to test your sperm.
TREY	"Charlotte, I'm eating. Is it too much to ask to have my Mu Shu without a side of sperm?"
CHARLOTTE	Why are you getting so mad? We're just talking.
TREY	"Hell's bells, it's only been three months! Why would you just leap to the conclusion that the problem is me?"
CHARLOTTE	"I'm not leaping to anything. It's just easier to test the man first. Less invasive. I'm sure your sperm is fine. No, it's better than fine, it's fantastic."
TREY	This little subject matter has put me right off my dinner. Excuse me.
CHARLOTTE	Trey. Honey?
TREY	Not now!
CARRIE	do men?
CARRIE	like them pulled?
AIDAN	how Would I know?
CARRIE	do you?
AIDAN	do I what?
CARRIE	like them pulled?
AIDAN	how do I know?
CARRIE	Why don't we give a little tug and see?
AIDAN	You wanna give a little tug? You're gonna do it too hard!
CARRIE	No!
CARRIE	All Right.
CARRIE	You were saved by the bell.
AIDAN	"Bradshaw House of Pain, how can we hurt you? Hello?"
BIG	"Man, it's me. I'm sorry to be calling you this late. Is Carrie there?"
AIDAN	"Yeah, Just a sec."
CARRIE	who is it? Hello?
BIG	It's me. I need to talk to you.
CARRIE	"It's really not a good time, we're about to go to bed."
BIG	"It's important. Willow is totally fucking with my head, please."
CARRIE	All right. He's having girlfriend problems. I'm gonna be just a minute.
CARRIE	"Apparently, dating a movie star makes you as crazy as dating anyone else."
CARRIE	What's the problem?
BIG	"She's in town, at the Mercer. We were supposed to meet tonight. She hasn't gotten back to me."
CARRIE	Did you call her?
BIG	"Yes, I called her. I called all five of her numbers. She never answers. Here's the thing, see she can reach me, but I can't ever get her."
CARRIE	Maybe she never got...
BIG	"No, you don't get it. She can reach me but I can't get her, ever. How fucked up is that?"
CARRIE	I don't know. Very? I thought everything was going great.
BIG	"It was, I mean, I flew out to LA to take her to that MTV award thing."
CARRIE	I'd better start feeling sorry for you soon.
BIG	And then she totally dissed me. I was following her around like a goddamn dog.
CARRIE	I'm just gonna be one more minute.
BIG	Listen to this message she left me.
CARRIE	I gotta go to bed!
BIG	"No, wait, listen. Listen to this."
WILLOW'S VOICE	"Gonna miss you. I can't wait until I'm in New York, in your arms. I'm in a New York state of mind."
CARRIE	'A New York state of mind''?
BIG	"It's Billy Joel, we love That song."
CHARLOTTE	Goodnight.
BIG	should I call her again?
CARRIE	"No, Goodnight."
CARRIE	"I'm sorry. So, you still want me to give them a little pull?"
AIDAN	No. Why'd you take the phone in there?
CARRIE	"Because I know you don't like him calling here, that's all."
AIDAN	"You tell me nothing's going on, then nothing's going on. You don't gotta run in a closet."
CARRIE	I didn't run and I went in there because I know how uncomfortable it makes you.
AIDAN	"How uncomfortable it makes me, or you?"
CARRIE	"Me, yes, I'm uncomfortable. I don't want you to feel threatened."
AIDAN	You think I'm threatened by him?
CARRIE	"No, not threatened!"
AIDAN	I Could take him.
CARRIE	who said Anything about taking him?
AIDAN	"I'm just saying. It's like the time Batman and the Green Hornet got in a fight. Everyone expected Batman to win because he's got the gadgets and the cape, the shit, but the Green Hornet had the moves. See, I'm the Green Hornet, I got the moves. Plus, I got Pete and he's like Kato. Aren't you, boy? Petey, come here, boy, come here! Who's your buddy? He's gonna get him. He's got him!"
CHARLOTTE	What do superheroes have to do with it?
CARRIE	"I have no idea. It's a guy thing. All I know is that in order to deal with Big, he had to turn himself into the Green Lantern."
IRANDA	Hornet.
CARRIE	I don't care if he's the Green Bee. I just wish there was a way for Aidan to really understand that he has nothing to worry about. Maybe I should try to get Big and him and me together.
IRANDA	Did you have a big plate of crazy for lunch?
CARRIE	"We could all talk and Aidan could see once and for all that I love him, and Big and I are just friends."
CHARLOTTE	"Carrie, I don't know."
CARRIE	Seriously. Keeping my relationship with Big in the closet only makes things worse.
SAMANTHA	"These are guys. They don't talk, they fight. They can't help it, it's all that crazy testosterone. God bless it."
CHARLOTTE	We're having Trey's sperm tested.
IRANDA	is It not doing Well in school?
CHARLOTTE	"We were discussing it over dinner last night and he just blew up. One minute he was perfectly happy, the next minute, furious."
SAMANTHA	That time of the month?
CHARLOTTE	It's a side of Trey I've never seen. It's about the sperm.
IRANDA	What is it with that area? It's like a minefield.
CARRIE	"I spent the afternoon thinking about my friends. Body image depression, unpredictable mood swings, late night phone calls obsessing about a relationship. Did I mention these are my male friends? So, maybe men and women aren't from different planets as pop culture would have us believe. Maybe we live a lot closer to each other, perhaps, dare I even say it in the same zip code?"
CARRIE	"In view of current circumstances, I couldn't help but wonder, are men just women with Balls?"
STEVE	look at that.
IRANDA	look at what?
STEVE	That dog's sack!
IRANDA	"No, Thank you."
STEVE	Did you know you can't enter a dog in a dog show if he's only got one Ball?
IRANDA	Where'd you hear that?
STEVE	"Around. They even make fake dog Balls. They make them for humans, too. I'm thinking about getting one."
IRANDA	"No, Steve. Why would you do that?"
STEVE	Why not? Women get breast implants all the time.
IRANDA	"Steve, trust me, I've been to the area and I swear to God, I wouldn't know if you had one or four."
STEVE	"But I know. Every time I look down at my nuts, correction, nut, I look all lopsided."
IRANDA	"Women don't care! We care about nice arms, great eyes, big dick. I have never once heard a woman say, ''He had such a big, full scrotum!''"
STEVE	I made an appointment. I'm talking to the doctor. Will you go with me?
IRANDA	"Where, testicle shopping?"
CARRIE	"Samantha finally got her meeting with hotel magnate, Richard. Smart, tough, a real ball buster."
RICHARD	"I've enjoyed meeting you, but truth be told, Ms. Jones, your rÃ©sumÃ©'s all fluff."
SAMANTHA	Fluff?
RICHARD	It's just parties and social events.
SAMANTHA	What is it that you do in your hotels? Nuclear fission?
RICHARD	"I admit I'm intrigued. If I wasn't, you would've been down in the lobby having a cappuccino 10 minutes ago. Here's an idea. I'm talking to Brad Rosen. Maybe you two can get together and share the work. Five hotels, it's a big job."
SAMANTHA	"I know it's a big job. That's why I'm still here and not down in the lobby having a cappuccino. I appreciate your offer, but I don't need a partner."
RICHARD	"Read between the lines, Ms. Jones. I deal with a lot of business... men."
SAMANTHA	What are you saying? That businessmen would be more comfortable dealing with a woman if she were working next to a man?
RICHARD	You have a lot to offer. You might want to consider working with a partner who isn't so emotional.
SAMANTHA	"'Emotional'' is just code for, ''I don't want to hire a woman.''"
RICHARD	"Exactly. They're that way at my firm, too. Think you're gonna cry over a legal brief."
SAMANTHA	have You ever cried over a brief?
RICHARD	"certainly, But Only in the privacy Of my office."
CHARLOTTE	"I cried once at the gallery, once, in 10 years, and from that day on it was, ''Careful, don't make Charlotte cry.''"
SAMANTHA	I have never cried at work.
CARRIE	"I fake cried to my editor when I missed a deadline. I told him I was having a bad time at home, but really I was having a good time in the Hamptons."
IRANDA	That makes the rest of us look bad.
CARRIE	"Boo hoo, it was 80 degrees and sunny."
SAMANTHA	"A guy gets angry in a meeting, he's a pistol, a woman, she's emotional."
CHARLOTTE	"If I say anything, like, ''I don't think that's hung high enough'' they say, ''Careful, don't make Charlotte cry''!"
SAMANTHA	What does he think I'm going to do? Get my period and ruin his empire?
IRANDA	"Yes, men, wait let me rephrase that, some men..."
CARRIE	"Good move, councilor. That will look much better on the court transcripts of this dinner."
IRANDA	"Some men are threatened by strong businesswomen. They have to find a way to make her be just a woman again. Hence, ''You're too emotional.''"
CARRIE	"'Hence,'' yet."
SAMANTHA	"I'm going back in there, guns blazing, cool, calm, collected. I'm going to impress that arrogant motherfucker so much he's gonna beg me to take the job."
CHARLOTTE	"Just don't cry. Once, in 10 years!"
CARRIE	"I've gotta run or I'm gonna miss my ride with Aidan. Then I'll have to take mass transit to the country, then there'll be some tears."
CARRIE	"The next day, while Aidan was tearing down the old shed, I was tearing through the new in Style with Big's big movie star on the cover."
CARRIE	Hello?
BIG	It's me.
CARRIE	What's the matter? You sound terrible.
BIG	Hope you don't mind my calling. I got the number off your machine. Where's area code 845?
CARRIE	"Upstate, we're in the country."
BIG	on a Thursday?
CARRIE	We're taking a long weekend. What's wrong?
BIG	She broke it off. She said she never wants to see me again.
CARRIE	I'm so sorry.
BIG	"I don't even know what I did. She won't return my calls. See, she can reach me, but I can't get her."
CARRIE	"You mentioned that. She's crazy, I'm telling you. She has the eyes of a crazy person."
BIG	"Man, I was such a chump. I really put myself out there and she drop-kicked me right in the fucking heart. When are you coming back to the city?"
CARRIE	Monday.
BIG	not till Monday?
BIG	Fuck.
CARRIE	"I'd invite you out here, but it's just so far away."
BIG	how far?
CARRIE	"It's 40 minutes, you know, if there's no traffic, but with the weekenders and everything, I don't know, an hour, maybe even two."
BIG	It's Thursday afternoon.
CARRIE	"Yeah, don't you have to work?"
BIG	"I have to see you. I'll get my Jag out of the garage. Maybe the drive will do me good. I'll come up for an hour, we'll talk, and then I'll head home. How do I get there? Let me get a pen."
AIDAN	"Hey, darling. We gotta close these windows up. It gonna rain. Did I hear the phone ring? Who was it?"
CARRIE	"It was Batman. I invited him up. I didn't mean to. I just got trapped. That crazy movie star lady broke up with him, he's devastated. He has no one else to talk to. Before I knew it I was telling him to make a right at the sign for Farm Fresh Summer Squash."
AIDAN	I don't want him in my house.
CARRIE	"I totally understand. He's gonna come up here, we're gonna have a quick talk. Then he's gonna go right back to the city where he belongs."
AIDAN	Fuck!
CARRIE	"You're my man. And I love you. He's just a friend in pain. I would never do this, but he's really hurting. Come on, haven't you ever had a girl break your..."
AIDAN	He better be fucking upset when he gets here. There better be tears.
CARRIE	Thank you.
AIDAN	"Let's go, Pete. He's got some balls coming up here."
DR. MANUEL	"The prosthesis approximates the weight, shape, and feel of a normal testicle. Squeeze it."
IRANDA	I'm sorry. I dropped the Ball.
DR. MANUEL	"Now, it comes in four sizes. Extra small, small, medium, and large."
STEVE	"I'd be a... Jeez, Miranda, what would I be?"
IRANDA	Medium?
STEVE	Yeah? I was thinking large.
IRANDA	I'm really not an expert. Large then.
STEVE	Medium. Really?
IRANDA	"a large medium, Steve."
DR. MANUEL	"Now, to get this model you have to enroll in a Clinical trial for market clearance."
IRANDA	Excuse me?
DR. MANUEL	It's not approved yet. It's Still Being tested for safety.
IRANDA	"No, Steve. no."
DR. MANUEL	"I assure you, it's perfectly safe."
STEVE	He says it's perfectly safe.
IRANDA	"That's what they said about the Ford Pinto. Think about it, Steve. You want a Pinto near your penis?"
CARRIE	"And in a different urologist's office, at the exact same time."
CHARLOTTE	Hi! Is everything ok? The nurse said you wanted to see me.
TREY	I'm afraid our old problem has reared its ugly head. I can't seem to rise to the occasion.
CHARLOTTE	"Let's not assume it's the same problem. Here, I bought you this."
TREY	Juggs?
CHARLOTTE	I know how much You like them.
TREY	You knew I'd have a problem.
CHARLOTTE	"No, I just came prepared. Look she's got big boobs. Look, so does she. It's the Big Boob Bonanza issue!"
TREY	"It's not that, it's..."
CHARLOTTE	"What, Honey?"
TREY	I'm afraid to. I don't think I can handle another problem in that area.
CHARLOTTE	"Don't you worry, Trey MacDougal, I'm sure that you have very strong Scottish sperm. And if you don't, we can just spin them and whip them up and do whatever it is you sexy doctor types do."
TREY	That's good.
CHARLOTTE	Yeah?
TREY	Keep doing that. do That thing I like.
CHARLOTTE	Which thing?
TREY	"You know, you give a little tug."
CARRIE	"Turned out, Trey's Scottish sperm was fine. No, better than fine, fantastic."
TREY	Where's the cup?
RICHARD	"I have to admit, you're the best person for the job. But I'm not gonna hire you."
SAMANTHA	Give me one legitimate reason why not.
RICHARD	Do I have to say it?
SAMANTHA	Yes. I'd like to hear the words come out of your mouth.
RICHARD	"Ok, you slept with my architect."
CARRIE	"Turns out, Samantha was wrong, men do talk."
RICHARD	And I don't wanna get into all that.
SAMANTHA	Into all what? It happened 100 years ago! I barely know the guy! And how does my personal life affect your business?
RICHARD	"I think the more accurate question would be how does your personal life affect your business? It's too bad. Other than that, you had the job."
SAMANTHA	"You know what? If I was a guy, you would have shaken my hand, bought me a scotch and given me a key to an office. It's amazing. A man with such innovative vision can be so shortsighted."
RICHARD	"Ms. Jones, wait."
CARRIE	But Samantha couldn't wait. She could feel the tears building up inside her.
RICHARD	Come on!
RICHARD	"Wait, not so fast!"
SAMANTHA	Close!
RICHARD	Ms. Jones!
CARRIE	"The next day, Richard hired Samantha. He told her he admired her balls."
CARRIE	"When Big still hadn't arrived two hours later, I was secretly praying he'd missed the sign for Farm Fresh Summer Squash. Then, there it was, the Bat mobile."
AIDAN	Maybe he doesn't wanna come in and meet your dad.
CARRIE	What're you doing just sitting here?
BIG	Waiting for you.
CARRIE	Why didn't you come in?
BIG	I don't want to go in. Let's go have a drink or something.
CARRIE	"Wanna get a drink, where? At a Ye Old Country lemonade stand? Why are you listening to that? Come on, turn off the car and come inside. We'll talk, all right?"
BIG	is he in there?
CARRIE	Yes.
BIG	I can't talk about this in front of him.
CARRIE	"Yes, you can, and you better. So, come on, let's go. Come on. Shit."
CARRIE	"An hour and two bottles of red wine later, Big started talking. Unfortunately, it was mostly to himself."
BIG	"'Her luminous skin ''a product of vegan diet discipline.'' Vegan diet, bullshit."
CARRIE	"All right, give me the magazine."
BIG	"No, wait, listen to this one. ''I'm looking for that someone special.'' She's not looking for anybody. Bullshit. Any more wine?"
AIDAN	Nope.
BIG	''Let's go have a drink and a smoke sometime.''
CARRIE	You can't smoke in the house.
BIG	That's cool. Guess I better head back. Thanks.
CARRIE	"Jesus. Look at him, he can't drive."
CARRIE	What do you think you're doing? You can't drive.
BIG	call my driver.
CARRIE	We're an hour outside New York.
BIG	"I'm in a New York state of mind, seen all the movie stars."
CARRIE	You're gonna have to sleep on the couch.
BIG	I better not. He doesn't want me here.
AIDAN	You can't drive. Sleep on the couch.
BIG	That's cool.
CARRIE	"After the Ball plan backfired, Miranda took Steve out to dinner to lift his spirits."
IRANDA	"Here's the book I was telling you about. A Positive Outlook to Healing. Steve, I'm starting to hit my limit."
STEVE	"I know. I just... I was just really counting on that fake Ball. It's just, every time I look down there, I feel..."
IRANDA	What?
STEVE	"This may be hard for you to understand, but who's gonna fuck a uniball bartender?"
CARRIE	Miranda realized the one thing she could do to help Steve didn't involve books or Balls.
BIG	What's that pounding?
CARRIE	Aidan's shooting hoops.
BIG	Isn't it a little early?
CARRIE	You have to Go out There and make friends with him.
BIG	"What are you talking about? We're middle-aged men, we don't make friends. We have nothing in common."
CARRIE	"You have me in common. If you and Aidan don't become at least a little friendly, I won't be able to stay in your life."
BIG	how do I do this?
CARRIE	"You're a guy, he's a guy, there's a ball, figure it out."
BIG	"Hey, man. I'm sorry about last night. I guess I got a little drunk. I didn't mean to come up and ruin your weekend or anything. You play hoop? Here, why don't you give me a shot? I play a little."
BIG	"A little muddy, I guess all that rain."
BIG	"Watch It, man. That was a little hard."
AIDAN	That wasn't that hard.
CARRIE	There they were. Batman and the Green Bee.
CARRIE	Stop it! Stop it! You're middle-aged!
BIG	That dog just bit my ass!
AIDAN	Pete!
CARRIE	"And just like that, Kato stopped the fight."
BIG	"And the thing is, see she could reach me but I could never get her. Day or night, whenever she could reach me, I couldn't get her. See?"
AIDAN	That's fucked up.
BIG	Yeah.
CARRIE	"Somehow, the storm had passed and I never fully understood why. Ok, maybe men and women don't live in the same zip code, but we're moving closer."
BIG	Good eggs.
CARRIE	In life sometimes we find ourselves at a crossroads.
CARRIE	In New York that crossroads tends to be busy and very loud.
CARRIE	Sorry! You're waiting. I know I'm 10 minutes late.
IRANDA	I'm three weeks late.
CARRIE	what?
IRANDA	I'm pregnant.
AN	Spare change?
IRANDA	"I'm sorry, I only have a..."
CARRIE	I got it.
AN	You are beautiful ladies. You'll make some man very happy.
CARRIE	"You're pregnant, really?"
IRANDA	"No, I Just thought It might be a fun thing to say. Fuck."
CARRIE	You're sure?
IRANDA	"I took three EPT tests and I'm coming from my doctor, which is why I called you to meet me way down here on the corner of 23rd and ''I'm in Hell.''"
CARRIE	When have you been having sex? I did not mean that the way it sounds.
IRANDA	Steve.
CARRIE	You're sleeping with Steve?
IRANDA	"Slept. Once. Singular. It was a mercy fuck. I felt bad, he only had one Ball."
CARRIE	I guess that's all he needed.
IRANDA	"No kidding. Apparently the other one was purely ornamental. God, I'm such a fucking idiot. Why didn't I use a condom?"
CARRIE	You didn't use a...
IRANDA	He only has one Ball and I have a lazy ovary! In what twisted world does that create a baby?
CARRIE	I see your point.
IRANDA	It's like the Special Olympics of conception!
CARRIE	have You told him?
IRANDA	Why would I tell him? I'm not having it.
CARRIE	Right.
CARRIE	is It oK not to Tell him?
IRANDA	"I don't know, is it?"
CARRIE	"While Miranda took a pregnant pause, Charlotte got an unpleasant surprise of her own, her period."
CARRIE	"look, Charlotte brought party favors."
CHARLOTTE	I'm never getting pregnant!
SAMANTHA	Would you please move the Tampax away from my toast points?
CHARLOTTE	"When I think of all those women, every day getting pregnant, getting pregnant."
CHARLOTTE	"I've been trying for five months, nothing!"
CARRIE	Don't worry. You'll get pregnant.
CHARLOTTE	When? A woman of 35 has only a 30 percent chance of conceiving. The numbers go down from there.
IRANDA	Numbers can be wrong.
SAMANTHA	"If it's so hard, how do you account for the number of crying children on planes?"
CHARLOTTE	This is not a laughing matter.
SAMANTHA	"I'm sorry. I thought this was brunch, not a fertility seminar."
CARRIE	"Ok, let's all just..."
CARRIE	"Charlotte, should we get you a menu?"
CHARLOTTE	It's me. I probably can't have a baby.
CARRIE	Don't say that.
CHARLOTTE	"It's true. Trey checked out fine. It's me, I know it's me."
CARRIE	It's not you.
CHARLOTTE	"Then what is it? I keep hearing all these stories about people getting pregnant just looking at each other. I do it on my head, on my side, on my back, on the top, on the bottom, on the top, then the bottom."
SAMANTHA	Now this is brunch talk.
CHARLOTTE	Do you know how many times Trey and I have done it without a condom? 73. Have you any idea how much perfectly fine semen that is?
CARRIE	"No. Samantha, rough estimate?"
CHARLOTTE	Enough for me to know in my bones that it's me. The big joke is I spent my entire 20s worried that I'd get pregnant. I could've screwed everything in sight!
SAMANTHA	"Coulda, woulda, shoulda."
CHARLOTTE	"I should've been so lucky to get pregnant by mistake. Ok. What's with the eyes, Miranda?"
IRANDA	Nothing.
CHARLOTTE	You're just sitting there. You haven't said a word and you're making ''the eyes.''
IRANDA	It's nothing.
CHARLOTTE	You think I'm pathetic or something?
CARRIE	It's not about you.
CHARLOTTE	What's not about me?
IRANDA	I cannot think Of a worse time to Tell You this.
CARRIE	"Oh, man."
CHARLOTTE	What the ''f'' is going on?
IRANDA	I'm pregnant. Steve.
SAMANTHA	Mercy fuck?
CHARLOTTE	"He only has one ball, it isn't fair!"
CARRIE	"Take a breath. Here, honey, have a sip of water."
CHARLOTTE	How could you do this to me?
IRANDA	to you?
CARRIE	"oK, Stop, please. stop."
SAMANTHA	What are You gonna do?
CHARLOTTE	You're not even going to consider having it?
IRANDA	This is not in my plans right now and I really feel awful talking about this in front of you.
CHARLOTTE	Then I'll leave.
IRANDA	No
CHARLOTTE	You can Just sit here and have your abortion talk.
CARRIE	"come on, Charlotte, Please sit down."
CARRIE	She didn't mean it. All she can think about right now is babies.
IRANDA	She makes me sound so...
SAMANTHA	"Don't do that. Ok, it's less than a desirable situation, but it happens. We've all been there."
IRANDA	I haven't.
SAMANTHA	"I've had two. Carrie, how many have you had?"
CARRIE	one.
SAMANTHA	"Right, that waiter at TGI Friday's."
CARRIE	"TGI Friday's? Please, can we not make this worse than it was?"
CARRIE	"He was a waiter at The Saloon, ok?"
CARRIE	"And let me remind you, in 1988, The Saloon was very happening."
IRANDA	Apparently.
AIDAN	You ready yet? We're approaching the 20 minute mark. Let's go!
AIDAN	what?
CARRIE	Nothing.
AIDAN	What? Are you cuckoo now? Are you going cuckoo on me?
CARRIE	"Ok, I want to tell you something, but if I tell you, you have to swear you're not gonna tell anyone."
AIDAN	I Promise.
CARRIE	here. Swear on Chanel.
AIDAN	I swear.
CARRIE	"Ok, Miranda's pregnant and she's having an abortion."
AIDAN	"Oh, man."
CARRIE	"And Charlotte's devastated, because she's been trying to get pregnant. She's been having a really hard time, and it's just bad all around."
AIDAN	"Come here. If Miranda doesn't want the kid, can't she just give it to Charlotte?"
CARRIE	No. It's not like a sweater.
AIDAN	"Oh, man. Who's the guy?"
CARRIE	"See, this is the reason that you can't tell anyone. It's Steve. And he doesn't know."
AIDAN	Come on!
CARRIE	what?
AIDAN	I feel like you just trapped me.
CARRIE	"I'm sorry, I had to tell you. It's all I could think about. Look, I can't even pick a shoe."
AIDAN	She's gonna do it without telling him.
CARRIE	what?
AIDAN	"what? It's his baby, too."
CARRIE	"Technically, it does not gonna be anybody's baby."
AIDAN	So what? It's all her decision? It seems like the guy gets the shit end of the stick.
CARRIE	You know it's a tough situation. I don't know.
AIDAN	You ever had one?
CARRIE	no. God no. Thank god.
SAMANTHA	"Look at that one, isn't it adorable?"
CARRIE	Which one?
SAMANTHA	The red one in the middle. I love it!
CARRIE	The Birkin bag? Really? That's not even your style.
SAMANTHA	"Honey, it's not so much the style as what carrying it means."
CARRIE	"It means you're out $4,000."
SAMANTHA	"Exactly. When I'm tooling around town with that bag, I'll know I've made it."
CARRIE	"Ok, let's go, the visiting hours are over."
SAMANTHA	"Byebye, Birkin."
CARRIE	I'm going with Miranda when she goes.
SAMANTHA	Good. I was alone and It was awful.
CARRIE	Why didn't you just ask someone to go with you?
SAMANTHA	It's not the kind of thing you list on the dorm activities board.
CARRIE	I lied to Aidan about having one. I don't know. It just came out.
CARRIE	"And the thing is, I think he seemed relieved, relieved that he could still think of me in a certain way. I don't know why I lied to him."
SAMANTHA	Maybe you still want him to think of you in a certain way.
SAMANTHA	It happened.
SAMANTHA	You made the right decision at the time.
CARRIE	"I know, but I never told the guy or anything."
SAMANTHA	"Look, you can't go down that road."
SAMANTHA	Did you really want to have a child with a guy who serves burgers on roller skates?
CARRIE	I could have a 13yearold child.
SAMANTHA	You could.
CARRIE	But then I wouldn't have known you. Can you imagine it?
SAMANTHA	No. I can't.
CARRIE	I should have told Aidan.
SAMANTHA	"Coulda, woulda, shoulda."
CARRIE	"So many roads, so many detours. So many choices, so many mistakes."
CARRIE	"As we drive along this road called life, occasionally a gal will find herself a little lost."
CARRIE	"When that happens, I guess she has to let go of the coulda, shoulda, woulda buckle up, and just keep going. As we speed along this endless road to the destination called ''Who We Hope To Be'', I can't help but whine, are we there yet?"
CARRIE	"For a publicist like Samantha, the road to success was paved with stars."
CARRIE	"Case in point, lunch with Lucy Liu."
SAMANTHA	I had No idea You were from New York.
LUCY LIU	I'm a total New York City girl from Queens.
SAMANTHA	That's amazing. I just don't get ''Queens'' from you.
LUCY LIU	"Look, bitch, don't start with me, 'right?"
SAMANTHA	That's good.
LUCY LIU	"Ok, here's what I need. I'm looking for someone from New York."
LUCY LIU	"My last P.R. guy was really hooked up, but he was a total liar. I'm a big girl, just tell me the truth. I can take it, you know?"
SAMANTHA	You want the truth?
SAMANTHA	Your last Golden Globe dress was a disaster.
LUCY LIU	"Thank you, that's what I thought."
LUCY LIU	But the queens kept telling me it was fierce.
SAMANTHA	A girl from Queens should know better than to listen to queens.
LUCY LIU	right?
SAMANTHA	Right.
LUCY LIU	"Another thing. I was a waitress, and twenty-five percent, very nice."
SAMANTHA	"When I'm representing you, it's class all the way."
HERMES CLERK	"It's $4,000."
SAMANTHA	I know.
HERMES CLERK	And there's a waiting list.
SAMANTHA	I assumed.
HERMES CLERK	five years.
SAMANTHA	for a bag?
HERMES CLERK	It's not a bag. It's a Birkin.
CARRIE	Samantha was never one for waiting in line. So she cut right to the front.
SAMANTHA	"It's not for me, it's for Lucy Liu. I'm her press rep and I would love for her to carry this bag to a premiere next week. It would be photographed to death. Does that make a difference?"
HERMES CLERK	"Let me get Francesca, our press rep, on the phone."
SAMANTHA	Would you? How very helpful.
CARRIE	"And over on Park Avenue Charlotte decided she couldn't wait any longer, either."
CHARLOTTE	I'm calling to make an appointment with Dr. Peck. We're having some... I'm having some difficulty.
CHARLOTTE	I think I need some fertility testing.
IRANDA	"I would like to make an appointment with Dr. Genya. I need to come in for a procedure, I'm pregnant. And l need not to be."
CARRIE	"A couple of days later, Samantha went down a road she shouldn't."
SAMANTHA	"Hello. Francesca? Samantha Jones. Question. How the fuck long does Lucy Liu have to wait for that Birkin? If they're so hard to get, maybe you can explain why I just saw a fucking nobody in a track suit carrying the exact one we want! Lucy Liu is a big big fucking star, and she wants that bag! Is ''HermÃ¨s'' French for ''We take our good old fucking time''? Thank you so much."
CARRIE	"Oh, my God! You scared me."
STEVE	Sorry. It's not a breaking and entering. We were playing basketball and your guy needed to take a leak.
AIDAN	Be right out!
STEVE	"So, what's new?"
CARRIE	Nothing. Absolutely Nothing. how are Things?
STEVE	"The bar's busting my hump, but it's pretty good. So, how's Miranda, is she ok?"
CARRIE	What do You mean?
STEVE	"I've been calling, she don't call me back."
CARRIE	She's great.
STEVE	"Yeah? she must be pretty busy then, I guess."
AIDAN	"Hey, pudding."
CARRIE	did You Tell him?
AIDAN	what?
CARRIE	About Miranda and the...
AIDAN	No!
CARRIE	are You sure?
AIDAN	Yeah.
CARRIE	He's asking about Miranda.
AIDAN	he always asks about Miranda.
CARRIE	"You told him, didn't you?"
AIDAN	no.
CARRIE	"Listen, it's ok, I can't keep secrets either, obviously."
AIDAN	I didn't tell him anything.
CARRIE	He's looking at me funny.
AIDAN	That's the way he looks at everyone.
CARRIE	are You sure?
AIDAN	I didn't tell him. But I think he deserves to know.
CARRIE	What Does That mean?
AIDAN	I don't agree with what she's doing.
CARRIE	It doesn't have anything to do with you.
AIDAN	"Chief, you told me. I'd just as soon not know any of it."
CARRIE	"Listen, sometimes you get in situations that are hard. You wish not be having this conversation with him in the next room. So just go. Go, because he's probably listening."
AIDAN	What's bugging you?
CARRIE	Nothing.
AIDAN	Let's go!
STEVE	Tell Miranda I said Hi.
CARRIE	oK.
IRANDA	I'm on a wait list. My regular doctor doesn't do them. ''No judgment.'' That's the way she said it. Like it was all one word. ''I don't perform them no judgment.''
IRANDA	"So, I'm waiting to see if this other doctor can fit me in. I want to get it over with as soon as possible."
CARRIE	have You thought Any more about telling Steve?
IRANDA	"No, Why Would I Tell Steve?"
CARRIE	"I don't know, maybe he has a right to know. No judgment."
IRANDA	Sounds like judgment.
CARRIE	I told Aidan.
IRANDA	Carrie!
CARRIE	I had to.
IRANDA	He's gonna tell Steve!
CARRIE	"he will not, I made Him Swear on Chanel."
IRANDA	as long as he took the oath Of fabric.
AIDAN	He seemed to have pretty strong opinions about the guy having a right to know.
IRANDA	"You know, I didn't think this could get any worse, but it has. Now I have to think about what I'm doing to Steve?"
CARRIE	Wouldn't you want to know?
IRANDA	"No. I don't even want to know, and it's me. Did you tell the guy from TGI Friday's?"
CARRIE	"Jesus, it was The Saloon. And no, I didn't. It was completely different."
CARRIE	"I was 22, we barely knew each other. We slept together once. After a drunken night at The Tunnel."
IRANDA	the Tunnel? No judgment.
CARRIE	I was thinking Maybe I should have told him.
IRANDA	There's no way I'm telling Steve. He'd want me to have it. You know what?
IRANDA	"You're right. Forget my life, I'm having Steve's baby. Pizza for everybody!"
DR. PECK	"Everything looks Just Fine. looks Good. Nope. Sorry, spoke Too soon."
TREY	What is it?
DR. PECK	your Blood and mucus tests show extremely elevated antisperm antibodies.
CHARLOTTE	is That bad?
DR. PECK	It just means it's gonna be that much more difficult for you to conceive naturally.
CHARLOTTE	How much more difficult?
DR. PECK	I'd give it a 15 percent shot. I would not suggest you wait much longer before you explore in vitro.
CARRIE	"After they learned about their detour on the road to baby, Trey had to go back to the Hospital and Charlotte decided to walk home."
IRANDA	Charlotte!
CHARLOTTE	Hi!
IRANDA	''Hi''? Are you kidding me?
CHARLOTTE	What do You mean?
IRANDA	"You saw me, turned, and walked the other way."
CHARLOTTE	"I didn't see you, I just changed direction. I'm allowed to change direction."
IRANDA	First you don't return my calls. Then you pretend not to see me on the street?
CHARLOTTE	I just... I really can't see you right now.
IRANDA	"You have to see me, because I'm standing right here. I'm sorry about this whole thing, but it's not a personal attack on you. It was a mistake."
CHARLOTTE	I really don't want to talk about this.
IRANDA	"This is hard for me, too, you know? It doesn't make it any easier, worrying that you hate me because you think you can't get pregnant."
CHARLOTTE	I can't get pregnant.
IRANDA	"if I can, You can."
CHARLOTTE	I can't! I just came from the doctor. Here. My body is attacking Trey's sperm! 15% chance. 15% chance of ever having a baby! Is it ok if I go now?
IRANDA	Sure. You want me to walk with you?
CHARLOTTE	"no. I Just want to be alone, OK?"
IRANDA	"Ok. But I'll walk a little way behind you, in case you change your mind and want to talk."
CHARLOTTE	"No, I'm ok."
CARRIE	"Charlotte walked all the way home. And even though she never turned back, she knew Miranda was behind her."
LUCY LIU	Hi! Sorry I'm late.
SAMANTHA	Don't worry about it.
LUCY LIU	"Look what I got! Some nice man dropped it off at my hotel this morning. HermÃ¨s, It's a..."
SAMANTHA	Birkin.
LUCY LIU	"It's not really my style, but it's a free bag!"
SAMANTHA	It's not exactly free. I paid for it. That's my bag.
LUCY LIU	What do You mean?
SAMANTHA	"There was a five year waiting list, blah, blah, blah, I used your name."
LUCY LIU	"Blah, Blah, blah?"
SAMANTHA	"Cutting to the chase, Yes."
LUCY LIU	"As long as we're cutting to the chase, the P.R. rep from HermÃ¨s called and told me my rep yelled ''fuck'' at her at least 12 times. Is that your idea of class?"
SAMANTHA	That is absurd. I have never used the ''f'' word.
LUCY LIU	who the Fuck are You kidding?
SAMANTHA	"Yes, I called to check on the bag. You know what? I was on my cell. Maybe she picked up some crazy person. One time I got this scary woman screaming from somewhere in New Jersey."
LUCY LIU	The only thing worse than a liar is a bad liar. I won't be needing your services anymore.
SAMANTHA	I am telling you the truth.
SAMANTHA	"If I was as bad an actress as you, I'd still be serving onion rings at TGI Friday's."
SAMANTHA	That's my fucking Birkin!
CARRIE	And there went Lucy Liu. ALL 'cause of a lucy lie.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, I found myself back at a familiar crossroads, the corner of Columbus and 1988. It was amazing. It hadn't changed at all. Same table, same menu. Same waiter."
CHAD	"Burger, medium well. Calamari."
CARRIE	"I couldn't believe it. His roller skates were gone and his Tony Danza Taxi hair was thinner, but it was definitely Chad. ''Drunken night at Tunnel'' Chad."
CHAD	You Ready to order?
CARRIE	Hello there.
CHAD	Our soups of the day are lentil and tortilla. Did anyone get your drink order?
CARRIE	Chad?
CHAD	Yeah?
CARRIE	"It's me, Carrie. Bradshaw. We met, like, 13 years ago. I came in a few times, half lemonade, half iced tea? And then there was that night at The Tunnel."
CHAD	Tunnel? I never went to Tunnel.
CARRIE	You went to Tunnel.
CHAD	"Sherry, I'm sorry, I don't remember."
CARRIE	It's Carrie.
CHAD	"Right, Carrie."
CARRIE	"I'll take the lentil soup, I guess, and some crackers."
CHAD	Crackers come with. Was I at least smart enough to try something?
CARRIE	No. You were the perfect gentleman.
CARRIE	"I stayed in 1988 just long enough to realize I had made the right decision. Even though I was sitting in the same seat, I was in a totally different place."
CARRIE	Do you suffer from headaches?
CARRIE	Allergies? Diabetes?
IRANDA	No.
IRANDA	Bad judgment with old boyfriends?
IRANDA	Yes.
CARRIE	I think I can write that in.
IRANDA	Does It hurt?
CARRIE	Not really. Mostly it's just unpleasant.
IRANDA	What about after? how long until I feel back to normal?
CARRIE	You're gonna have to ask them.
IRANDA	how long until You felt back to normal?
CARRIE	Any day now.
IRANDA	I'm doing the right thing. Right?
CARRIE	"Miranda, I cannot answer that."
IRANDA	What do You think?
CARRIE	What do You think?
IRANDA	"I think, What do You think?"
CARRIE	You Wanna Go one more round?
IRANDA	"Charlotte only has a 15 percent chance, and she's really trying. What if I wake up at 43 and find that my one semi decent ovary gave up and I can't have kids."
CARRIE	43?
IRANDA	That's my ''scary age.''
CARRIE	Mine's 45.
IRANDA	"This happened against all the odds. My stupid egg found its way to the three sperm he had left. God, is this my baby? I mean, what am I waiting for?"
CARRIE	"Sweetie, do you want to leave?"
IRANDA	No. I can't have a baby. I could barely find the time to schedule this abortion.
NURSE	Miranda Hobbes?
IRANDA	Motherfucker.
SAMANTHA	take It easy. sip slowly.
IRANDA	I'm ok.
SAMANTHA	a little pillow here.
CARRIE	I got it.
CHARLOTTE	Hi.
IRANDA	Hi.
CHARLOTTE	"Hi. I thought some flowers might do whatever it is, flowers are supposed to do in a situation like this."
CARRIE	I felt the same way about Entenmann's lemon strudel.
CHARLOTTE	how are You feeling?
IRANDA	"Pretty freaked out. Charlotte, I didn't do it. I'm keeping the baby."
CHARLOTTE	"Oh, my God. We're having a baby?"
CARRIE	"And with those four little words, three aunts were born."
CARRIE	"As for me, I shoulda left Miranda's earlier so I woulda been on time."
CARRIE	Ten minutes late. That's the charm of me.
AIDAN	I'm starved. They wouldn't seat me till my party was here.
CARRIE	I'm your party?
AIDAN	Excuse me. here she is.
HOSTESS	We let the table go. It'll be a bit of a wait.
CARRIE	we can Go someplace else.
AIDAN	And wait there? We'll be at the bar.
HOSTESS	"Fine, I'll put your name on the list of the bar."
CARRIE	Wait. There's a wait to wait?
AIDAN	We'll be outside. Don't forget us.
CARRIE	Excuse me. Sorry.
AIDAN	How's that beer?
CARRIE	That's classy. And no waiting.
AIDAN	nice.
CARRIE	I lied to you. I did have an abortion. The condom broke.
CARRIE	"Ok, that's another lie. There was no condom."
AIDAN	What's with all the lying?
CARRIE	I'm afraid you're gonna judge me. For being 18 and sleeping with a guy without a condom and getting pregnant and never telling him.
CARRIE	"There, that's the whole truth. Except that I was 22. I should've known better."
AIDAN	Is your name really Carrie?
CARRIE	Yes. So are You judging me?
AIDAN	I was No angel.
CARRIE	Why? did You ever get a girl pregnant?
AIDAN	no. not That I know of.
CARRIE	"Goddamn, It must be Nice to be a guy sometimes. So, am I Still your girl?"
AIDAN	Yeah.
HOSTESS	your table is ready.
AIDAN	be Right there.
CARRIE	And another thing. Miranda's keeping the baby. Don't tell Steve. It's not our business.
CARRIE	"They say life is what happens when you're busy making other plans. But sometimes in New York, life is what happens when you're waiting for a table."
CARRIE	"New York welcomes and shelters the tired, the poor, the persecuted who have been forced to leave their homes at the whim of a ruling class. Therefore, it's ironic that all Manhattanites face the same horrible uncertainty, knowing that any day they may have to utter the tragic words."
CARRIE	My building's going co-op.
AIDAN	did You get the tomatoes?
CARRIE	"My building's going co-op. I have to move, this is a nightmare."
AIDAN	Why don't you just buy the place?
CARRIE	"Yeah, ok, sure. That's a great idea."
AIDAN	Why not?
CARRIE	"Aidan, I just charged tomatoes. I really don't think I'm in a position to buy an apartment."
AIDAN	I am.
CARRIE	You are?
AIDAN	Yeah.
CARRIE	"I had no idea. You have a girlfriend, moneybags?"
AIDAN	"Afraid so, and she's sexy and I like it."
CARRIE	Figures.
AIDAN	seriously. You Wanna talk about this?
CARRIE	You're not buying my apartment for me.
AIDAN	"Not for you, for us. I could sell my place and buy this place and that place next door."
AIDAN	We could tear down that wall. We could live together.
CARRIE	So then are you .Would that make you my landlord or my roommate?
AIDAN	little Of both.
CARRIE	What Would the rent be like?
AIDAN	like this?
CARRIE	Does That include utilities?
AIDAN	no. think about it.
CARRIE	"I have to admit, I was tempted by his offer. We were spending almost every night together already and we were in love and moving is such a pain in the ass. And so were the hormone injections Charlotte was facing nightly."
TREY	"I don't approve of this, Charlotte."
TREY	You've got more hormones in you than a teenage boy.
CHARLOTTE	this is What we have to do now.
TREY	we ought to try to have a baby the old-fashioned way.
CHARLOTTE	Why don't we sit around and wait for a stork?
TREY	The doctor said there's still a chance.
CHARLOTTE	"a very, very slim chance."
TREY	That's good news.
CHARLOTTE	"If you had a patient who had a very slim chance of living, would that be good news?"
CHARLOTTE	"Would you tell the family, ''Buck up, he's got a shot in hell''?"
TREY	Point taken.
CHARLOTTE	That's why we have to move on to in vitro.
CHARLOTTE	It took Peggy Woodruff seven years to conceive.
TREY	Who's Peggy Woodruff?
CHARLOTTE	"A woman I met in the elevator. A lot of couples have trouble conceiving, and they get through it."
CHARLOTTE	"In our building, there are six couples who have been through in vitro."
TREY	"What did you do? Put up a flyer in the lobby ''We're barren, how about you?''"
CHARLOTTE	We're not barren. We're reproductively challenged.
CHARLOTTE	And Peggy invited us over on Friday night to hear all about their experiences. Isn't that nice?
TREY	As tempting as that sounds we have the Scottish Society Highland Fling Friday night.
CHARLOTTE	Do we have to fling?
TREY	"Yes, it's a family tradition. First comes spring, then comes fling. We go every year."
CHARLOTTE	"Ok, but when are we gonna talk to the Woodruffs?"
TREY	"I don't wanna talk to the Woodruffs. I'm a doctor. I'm familiar with in vitro. It's a very invasive procedure. The success rate is extremely low, and it can take years."
CHARLOTTE	"I know, honey, so, just in case, I put us on the list for a Mandarin baby."
CARRIE	"As Charlotte's plan for parenthood progressed with or without Trey, I began to wonder if Aidan's plan was progressing without me. He never officially moved in, but his stuff was everywhere."
CHARLOTTE	You're getting engaged!
CARRIE	I threw up. I saw the ring and I threw up. That's not normal.
SAMANTHA	That's my reaction to marriage.
SAMANTHA	What do you think you'll do if he asks?
CARRIE	I don't know.
CHARLOTTE	Just say yes!
CARRIE	It hasn't been long enough. Has it?
CHARLOTTE	Trey and I got engaged after Only a month.
SAMANTHA	How long before you separated?
CHARLOTTE	"We're together now, and that's what matters."
CHARLOTTE	"When it's right, you just know."
SAMANTHA	Carrie doesn't know.
IRANDA	Carrie threw up.
CARRIE	"So, it might not be right."
CARRIE	Maybe this is all happening because my building is going co-op.
CARRIE	Is this a real estate merger? Am I a real estate bride?
IRANDA	"If there were unlimited apartments in Manhattan, we'd all be single forever."
CHARLOTTE	What did the ring look like?
CARRIE	That's the other thing. The ring was not good.
IRANDA	What do You mean?
CARRIE	It was a pear shaped diamond with a gold band.
SAMANTHA	No wonder You threw up.
CARRIE	It's Just not me.
IRANDA	You wear gold jewelry.
CARRIE	"Yeah, like ghetto gold, for fun. But this is my engagement ring."
IRANDA	I helped pick the ring.
CARRIE	You knew about this?
IRANDA	Aidan wanted a female perspective.
IRANDA	"P.S., I was a pregnant woman shopping for a ring with a man who's not the baby's father."
IRANDA	It's not exactly my dream scenario.
CHARLOTTE	At least you're pregnant!
IRANDA	Will you yell at me every time I mention it?
IRANDA	Because we've got another seven months to go.
CARRIE	"I'll just say ''I'm not ready to get engaged yet, but I love you and I wanna live with you.''"
CARRIE	How does that sound?
SAMANTHA	Like a ''no.''
CARRIE	"It's a ''yes'' to living together. That's a big deal, a first for me. Don't I get some credit for that?"
CHARLOTTE	Try to be nice because down the road you might wanna marry him.
CARRIE	I'm gonna have to act surprised. I wonder when it's gonna happen. You know when He'll do it?
IRANDA	No. You're on your own. I am no longer involved.
CARRIE	"Now you're not involved. Now that I'm stuck with the bad ring. See, that's a nice ring. He should have known that ring wasn't me. How can I marry a guy who doesn't know which ring is me?"
SAMANTHA	"Exactly, honey. Wrong ring, wrong guy."
CARRIE	Is it true what Charlotte said? Does anybody really know when it's right? And how do you know? Are there signs? Fireworks? Is it right when it feels comfortable or is comfortable a sign that there aren't any fireworks? Is hesitation a sign that it's not right or is it just a sign that you're not ready?
CARRIE	"In matters of love, how do you know when it's right?"
CARRIE	"Downtown, Samantha was meeting with Mr. Wright, Mr. Richard, that is. The hotel magnate slash megaclient who was fast becoming the pain in her ass."
RICHARD	You're 7 minutes late.
SAMANTHA	It took me 15 minutes to get through your labyrinth of a lobby.
RICHARD	Where's my London hotel? Bobby De Niro spends the weekend at Blakes and I get knocked off the page. That little fucker has stayed at my place! We gave him the fucking penthouse suite!
RICHARD	"Now, did you ask somebody what happened or did you just spend the morning accessorizing?"
SAMANTHA	I talked to the travel editor. I pulled two of our ads. It won't happen again. I also got a full-page feature on the Barcelona property out of it.
RICHARD	Not bad.
SAMANTHA	May I sit down now?
RICHARD	"What the hell? What's with you, female trouble?"
SAMANTHA	"Let's just talk business, shall we?"
RICHARD	"Come on, you can tell me, I'm human."
SAMANTHA	All evidence to the contrary.
RICHARD	I love that you're not scared of me.
SAMANTHA	my best friend might be getting engaged.
RICHARD	She didn't ask you to be a bridesmaid?
SAMANTHA	"It's just, why does everyone have to get married and have kids? It's so clichÃ©."
RICHARD	"You're preaching to the converted. I like to sleep around, whisk somebody off to Rio if the mood strikes me. It's the perfect nine hour flight. Dinner on the jet, wake up in Brazil and spend the weekend in my little five star hotel. Who needs a wife when you have a life?"
SAMANTHA	That's all I'm saying.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, Miranda had been waiting for the right place and the right way to tell Steve about the baby."
STEVE	You want sprinkles?
IRANDA	"Steve, I'm pregnant."
CARRIE	Instead she settled for right now.
STEVE	You're what?
IRANDA	I'm pregnant. And it's yours.
VENDOR	That'll be $6.
STEVE	You sure?
IRANDA	I've only had one shot in the last few months and it was you.
STEVE	I'm the only guy you've had sex with?
IRANDA	It's been a slow summer.
IRANDA	"Ok, we're done here."
STEVE	"I guess it's good to know that my one Ball is still working. So, what now?"
IRANDA	I'm gonna have it.
STEVE	"No way! When we were together, I wanted to have a baby, you said you weren't ready."
IRANDA	"I'm still not ready, but when am I ever gonna be ready?"
STEVE	"Man, I just went into so much debt opening my bar. I'm thinking maybe I should sell it."
IRANDA	"No. You don't have to do anything. I'll take care of the baby and support it and you can visit whenever you want, but it's not gonna be your problem. It's my decision, and it's just something I want to do for me."
STEVE	then Why did You Wanna talk to me about it?
IRANDA	I Just thought You should know.
CARRIE	"Later that week, I decided to head Aidan off at the pass by taking him out to dinner and accepting his proposal."
CARRIE	"So, yes. I say yes to living together. I think that we're ready for that step. We still have to work out the money 'cause I don't want a free ride. We're still individuals. But We'll be sharing a life and an apartment. Yes, Aidan I would love to live with you."
AIDAN	That makes me really happy because there's something else I wanna ask you.
CARRIE	Would You Excuse me for a minute?
AIDAN	"sure, are You OK?"
CARRIE	"I'm just gonna go to the bathroom... God, what are you doing?"
FEMALE VOICE	are You talking to me?
CARRIE	"No. No, I wasn't. I'm sorry."
AIDAN	did You want dessert?
CARRIE	no. I Would say No to desserts.
AIDAN	"All right, then. Listen, Carrie. I know that you wanted to pay, but let me get this because your rent's about to skyrocket. Give me a little something. Yeah."
TREY	You're learning Chinese?
CHARLOTTE	Just in case. I wanna be able to speak to the baby.
TREY	Wouldn't we teach the baby to speak?
CHARLOTTE	"Sometimes you get a slightly older child. And anyhow, we ought to really try to understand her heritage."
TREY	"So, it's a Mandarin girl now, is it?"
CHARLOTTE	"It's mostly little unwanted girls. But the good news is, since we're both dark-haired, people won't immediately know that she's not ours. I hope you remembered to pick up your kilt at the drycleaner."
TREY	You know I really don't feel like going to the fling tonight.
CHARLOTTE	"We have to go, it's a family tradition. We are not gonna behave like your typical barren couple!"
CHARLOTTE	"We can't let this get us down! We have to live! Plus, I had a plaid dress made."
TREY	Maybe we should look at cutting back on your fertility drugs. Just a thought.
CARRIE	"Taxi! What, come on, buddy, you've got nobody in there."
BIG	
CARRIE	Is this the city's solution to the cab shortage?
BIG	Just a happy coincidence.
CARRIE	"Admit it, you drive around looking for me, don't you?"
BIG	"Don't flatter yourself, you're on my turf."
CARRIE	You've got the good shops.
BIG	"Get in, we're holding up traffic. Going home?"
CARRIE	Yeah. Are you seriously giving me a ride? Is it on your way?
BIG	"Nope. Raoul, East 73rd Street."
RAOUL	Right away.
CARRIE	Thank you.
BIG	"Raoul and I do this all day. Picking the ladies up, dropping them off. How've you been?"
CARRIE	"good, you?"
BIG	very Good.
CARRIE	"Then I've been very, very good."
BIG	It's not a contest.
CARRIE	"All right, then I take back one ''very.''"
BIG	how are things with country Bob?
CARRIE	You know his name now.
BIG	Aidan.
CARRIE	"things are very good There, too."
BIG	What was that?
CARRIE	what?
BIG	That smile?
CARRIE	I don't think you want to know.
BIG	I bet I can handle it.
CARRIE	are You sure?
BIG	What the hell?
CARRIE	I think he wants to marry me.
BIG	"You think, Or You know?"
CARRIE	"I know, actually."
BIG	And you've discussed it?
CARRIE	"No, l... it's just the kind of thing you know."
BIG	not gonna happen.
CARRIE	Let's not talk about it.
BIG	He's not the guy for you.
CARRIE	He might be the guy for me. I'm just not ready yet.
BIG	"You're never gonna be ready, baby. You're not the marrying kind."
CARRIE	"and You, I Guess, are? So, What Does That Tell Us?"
BIG	Nobody knows shit?
CARRIE	"Yeah. In any case, I'm not taking relationship advice, from you."
BIG	I Just offered You a ride.
IRANDA	Hello?
CARRIE	Spy girl. Did you tell Aidan I didn't like the ring? Did you tell him not to propose?
IRANDA	I'm out of this now.
CARRIE	Did he change his mind? Why hasn't he asked me yet?
IRANDA	You're not saying yes. What's your hurry?
CARRIE	"I just think it's weird, he has the ring. What if he realized I'm not the one?"
IRANDA	You're not sure he's the one.
CARRIE	"But he doesn't know that, unless you told him."
IRANDA	Hang on a second.
CARRIE	"What happened, did someone propose to you?"
IRANDA	I don't know why they call it morning sickness when it's all fucking day long. Unless it's MOURN as in ''mourning'' the loss of your single life.
CARRIE	"Apparently, we've reached the stage where our lives are making us sick. Man."
CHARLOTTE	I'm sore from the shots!
TREY	Sorry.
CARRIE	"The New York Scottish Society's Annual Highland Fling. Any Scot who was anyone was there, including, of course, Bunny MacDougal."
BUNNY	I was wondering when you'd be arriving. You missed dinner and the dancers.
TREY	
CHARLOTTE	"Hello, Bunny."
BUNNY	"Hello, my dear, don't you look festive! Trey, you must join your brothers. They're out there making complete fools of themselves."
CHARLOTTE	do You know That dance?
TREY	"Unfortunately, I do. Excuse me."
BUNNY	"It's the Highland fling, dear. It's what this event was named after."
CHARLOTTE	"For something called a fling, it looks like a lot of work."
BUNNY	That's what I used to tell Trey about you. Come. They say this dance was originally danced on the shield of a clansman. Do you know anything about clans?
CHARLOTTE	I know this is the MacDougal clan's tartan.
BUNNY	"Yes. MacDougal is one of the oldest Highland clans in existence. We have a very proud lineage, one I hope you and Trey will be able to perpetuate. Now, I know some things can't be helped, but I must tell you right now I don't enjoy Mandarin food and I don't enjoy a Mandarin child."
CHARLOTTE	I don't think that's any of your business.
BUNNY	"But it is my business. The MacDougal name will be carried on by sons of your own, not daughters of the South Pacific. Would you care for some shortbread?"
CHARLOTTE	"No. If we want a Mandarin baby, we can have a Mandarin baby. Nobody else needs to be involved!"
BUNNY	"Then let's not involve the entire Scottish population of New York City, shall we?"
CHARLOTTE	"I'm serious. I'm doing all the work! I'm getting the hormone shots, I'm taking the pills, I'm doing the research, I'm in the chat room with the other reproductively challenged women and I'm learning Mandarin. All you have to do is jerk off into a plastic cup!"
TREY	"Charlotte, get a hold of yourself."
CHARLOTTE	You get a hold of yourself! And try to keep your mother out of it!
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, Samantha's professional relationship really started to take off."
SAMANTHA	I Would have taken It off.
RICHARD	I'll buy you a new one.
DWIGHT	"Excuse me. We're about to take off, we need you to buckle your seat belts."
RICHARD	"Thanks, Dwight."
SAMANTHA	"sure, Dwight. is this a good idea? You are my boss."
RICHARD	"Yes, and I Definitely need You to see my property in Brazil."
SAMANTHA	this is on the clock then?
RICHARD	"No, but, out of curiosity, what do you charge for this sort of thing?"
SAMANTHA	Believe me. You couldn't afford it.
RICHARD	I'm a very rich man.
SAMANTHA	I'm a very talented woman.
CHARLOTTE	I need you to give me my shot.
TREY	"For the love of God, do we have to do that tonight?"
CHARLOTTE	We have to do it every night if we want to continue the MacDougal clan.
TREY	I said I was sorry. What else do you expect from me?
CHARLOTTE	I don't understand why you talked to Bunny. Why don't you talk to me?
TREY	Because I don't know how to tell you I'm exhausted. How much work is a marriage supposed to be?
CHARLOTTE	This is just a tough phase. Once we have a baby...
TREY	That could take years. I'm 43. When does it get easy?
CHARLOTTE	this is What a relationship is.
TREY	"No. No, this is what our relationship is. I didn't see anyone else getting screamed at on the dance floor."
CHARLOTTE	"I'm sorry, it's the hormones."
TREY	then Stop taking the hormones.
CHARLOTTE	I can't.
TREY	"I can't keep doing what we're doing. I love you, but I don't know if I'm cut out for this."
CHARLOTTE	What are you saying?
TREY	"I don't think I wanna have a baby anymore. I don't have the energy. I work hard, and I like to play golf. I just want to be for a while."
CHARLOTTE	"So, you don't even want to try?"
TREY	"I don't. I don't wanna try. If it's the right thing, then it'll happen. If it's not, then it won't."
CHARLOTTE	But we've been planning all along to have a family.
TREY	"You and I will have to be enough. I mean, I think I could be happy with just the two of us. I'm not sure you can, though."
CHARLOTTE	I'm gonna get some juice.
TREY	"Charlotte, are You All right?"
CHARLOTTE	I don't know.
CARRIE	"Sometimes, the question is, how do you know when it's not right?"
AIDAN	"See, isn't this nice?"
CARRIE	It was Nice Being in the bed.
AIDAN	"when Pete has to Go, Pete has to go."
CARRIE	"oK, But Why do I have to go?"
AIDAN	Keep your old man company. Make sure some hottie doesn't come along with a little pooch and steal him away.
CARRIE	Pete would never leave me. Pete loves me so.
AIDAN	"He does, don't you, Pete? Come here. Pete loves you. Don't you love her? I love her, too. Do you have a baggie? I didn't bring a baggie."
CARRIE	This just gets better and better.
AIDAN	"Here, hold this, would you? Go ahead, open it."
CARRIE	"My God, it's not... God. That's such a beautiful ring."
AIDAN	Really?
CARRIE	Yeah.
AIDAN	"I had a different one, then I changed my mind. This one seemed more like you. I love you, Carrie. There's no one I could love more. I wanna live my life with you. What do you think?"
CARRIE	"Maybe there are no right moments, right guys, right answers. Maybe you just have to say what's in your heart."
CARRIE	Yes.
AIDAN	Gimme. oK.
CARRIE	That night I surprised myself.
IRANDA	who is it?
STEVE	It's me!
CARRIE	And Miranda was getting a surprise as well.
IRANDA	"What, are You fucking crazy?"
STEVE	That's your answer?
IRANDA	Why are You proposing?
STEVE	I thought that's what you wanted.
IRANDA	"I don't want to marry you, Steve."
STEVE	I don't want to marry you either.
IRANDA	Then what are we doing?
STEVE	There's gonna be a baby. And I just... I don't wanna just be a guy who sees you at the playground. I wanna help.
IRANDA	"That doesn't mean we have to get married. You're not in love with me, right?"
STEVE	"No, especially not right now."
IRANDA	"You need to say that every day, because when you see me with this baby, you're gonna think we belong together, you're gonna think you're in love with me."
STEVE	"I don't know, I've seen you with my dog, and mostly you just seem uncomfortable. How are we gonna do this? Raise a kid together and not be together?"
IRANDA	We'll figure it out.
STEVE	We'll figure it out.
CARRIE	"Miranda knew Steve wasn't right for her, but she wanted to do what was right for her baby."
IRANDA	"By the way, I know that's a hand-me-down ring. I would never say yes to a hand-me-down ring."
STEVE	You picked out this ring!
IRANDA	For Carrie!
STEVE	"Fine, frankly, I can't afford a stupid ring and a baby."
IRANDA	"see, this is working out already."
CARRIE	There was one person I needed to tell that surprisingly I was the marrying kind.
SAMANTHA	Thank God you're here.
CARRIE	I have something to Tell you.
SAMANTHA	Aidan left you?
CARRIE	I'm engaged.
SAMANTHA	"Fuck you. Let's have a drink and celebrate. Two Rubies, please."
CARRIE	he switched the ring on me.
SAMANTHA	the bastard.
CARRIE	"And look, it's a really good ring."
SAMANTHA	I've seen it.
CARRIE	what?
SAMANTHA	Somebody had to help the poor guy.
CARRIE	"So, now you want me to get married?"
SAMANTHA	"No, but if you're gonna ruin our lives, I'd at least like to look at a nice piece of jewelry."
CARRIE	Thank you.
BARTENDER	two Rubies.
CARRIE	"are You tan, lady?"
SAMANTHA	I was in Rio with Richard.
CARRIE	Rio with the CEO? A mistake.
CARRIE	"Someone once said that two halves make a whole. And when two halves move in together, it makes a whole lot of stuff."
CARRIE	"Hey, what's..."
AIDAN	"Pop tart, where You been and What have You been doing?"
CARRIE	"I got coffee and papers, but I think the more pressing question is, what have you been doing?"
AIDAN	made myself an area.
CARRIE	"Yes, I can see that."
AIDAN	"I needed a space for my work papers and stuff, you know, so is that okay?"
CARRIE	"Yeah, sure yes, it's just... you're blocking the bathroom door."
AIDAN	"Yeah, but you got another one. Who needs two bathroom doors?"
CARRIE	"I do, me. Me, the one who loves her two bathroom doors."
AIDAN	Why do you need two doors for?
CARRIE	"Sometimes I'm in a hurry and it's just quicker to go, ping, out that one and it's my escape route in case."
AIDAN	In case what?
CARRIE	"In case rapists come in my bedroom window I see them in the mirror and then, phew, I'm gone."
AIDAN	There's a whole lot of phewing going on in that bathroom. It's just gonna be like this until we're able to take over the apartment next door then we can load the stuff in.
CARRIE	"And would that be happening in the next five minutes please, God?"
AIDAN	Closing at the end of next week.
CARRIE	"Hello, Petey. Really, what's the problem, right? It's just boxes, right?"
CARRIE	A plant! The man brought a living thing into my apartment. I don't do plants. I kill everything I bring in there.
IRANDA	"You said yes to moving in, he moved in."
CARRIE	But he's taking over whole areas.
SAMANTHA	"This is why I've never lived with a man. This, and the fact that I want them out an hour after I climax."
IRANDA	You let them stay a whole hour?
SAMANTHA	You'd be surprised how many are ready to go again after a quick catnap.
CARRIE	"And there's no walls, there's nowhere to hide. As soon as I walk in, he's all up with: ''Who'd you see? Where'd you go? Who'd ya meet? What'd ya know?'' What I know is, I need time to decompress. Just be alone."
CHARLOTTE	But there have to be some adjustments. Relationships are hard.
CARRIE	"You guys, I miss walking into my apartment with no one there and it's all quiet and I can do that stuff you do when you're totally alone, things you would never want your boyfriend to see you do."
SAMANTHA	Like masturbate?
CARRIE	"My S.S.B., my Secret Single Behavior. Like, I like to make a stack of saltines. I put grape jelly on them. I eat them standing up in the kitchen reading fashion magazines."
CHARLOTTE	Why standing up?
CARRIE	"It's weird, But It Just feels great."
IRANDA	I like to put Vaseline on my hands and put them in Borghese conditioning gloves while watching infomercials.
CHARLOTTE	Before I was married I used to study my pores in a magnifying mirror for an hour each night. But I'm afraid Trey will think it's weird.
CARRIE	"He would. You can't do that stuff in front of men. What about you, Lolita? Anything you do you wouldn't want a man to see?"
SAMANTHA	no.
IRANDA	"You know, I believe her."
CARRIE	"Hey, didn't we make a rule about those things at lunch?"
SAMANTHA	"It's my boss, I have to take it."
SAMANTHA	"Samantha Jones. Richard, it's Sunday. Fine. I'll see you in an hour."
SAMANTHA	He wants me to drop something off this afternoon.
CARRIE	"Nice. A little skyrockets in flight, afternoon Delight?"
SAMANTHA	"No, it's just work."
CHARLOTTE	"Hardly, you're sleeping with him."
SAMANTHA	You told them?
CARRIE	I also like to gossip on the phone while secretly pumicing my calluses.
IRANDA	"So, how is he? And spare no detail, I'm a horny pregnant person."
SAMANTHA	I don't want to talk about it.
CARRIE	Samantha likes a guy.
SAMANTHA	I do not.
CHARLOTTE	You do! You do! Or you would tell us all the dirty details.
IRANDA	"My God, we're gonna have to ice skate home. Hell just froze over."
SAMANTHA	"Okay, you want details? He's got the most perfect dick I've ever seen. Long, pink, amazing. it's dickalicious."
CARRIE	"All right, so, what should I do about Aidan's stuff?"
CHARLOTTE	I'm gonna have the girls over for dinner.
TREY	That sounds like fun. What night?
CHARLOTTE	Just the girls. I'm trying to get my day planner back together. I have much more free time since we left the baby track.
CARRIE	"Some apartments are cluttered with physical stuff, others, emotional stuff."
CHARLOTTE	It's a big readjustment. I've wanted a baby ever since I was a little girl. We have a baby room and no baby.
TREY	"I've got some good news. Bram Pomander thinks he's snagged us orchestra seats to The Producers next week. Charlotte, yes, we're disappointed. But life goes on. We still have to find a way to have a giggle. Come on, give me a smile."
RICHARD	"Hold on. Investors in Munich. How do you say ""fuck you"" in German?"
RICHARD	Impressive. Why do you speak German?
SAMANTHA	"A gal has her reasons. That wasn't ""fuck you"", it was ""fuck me""."
RICHARD	That's a negotiation ploy I haven't tried before.
SAMANTHA	Who're You kidding?
RICHARD	Where's the magazine layout?
SAMANTHA	"Signed, sealed, delivered."
RICHARD	One more thing.
CARRIE	"It was perfect: long, pink, amazing."
RICHARD	I thought about you all weekend.
SAMANTHA	Let me see if I can give you something to think about all evening. Bring out that gorgeous dick.
RICHARD	You're gonna get down on your knees right here? What if my assistant sees you?
SAMANTHA	I dropped my portfolio. That may take some time to pick up.
SAMANTHA	Das ist einen sch?nen perfekten Schwanz.
RICHARD	"Whoops. Better get those, while you're down there."
IRANDA	"If I had known you were gonna turn out to be so not a loser, I would have run home after work and changed."
WALKER	Or at least put on some fresh deodorant. Careful. I was a much younger man when we started trying to set up this blind date.
IRANDA	You're the one who kept canceling to go to... Where were you?
WALKER	"First time, Spain and Romethe, second time, Luxembourg and Athens."
CARRIE	"Walker Lewis, fluent in five Languages, traveled the world as a State Department interpreter."
WALKER	"Seriously, Miranda, best blind date I have ever had in the continental U.S.A."
WALKER	"What? Listen, any reason I can't see you again before I go to Brussels?"
IRANDA	He is so cute and funny and sexy. And I really want to have sex with him. But I don't know. Is it okay to fuck one guy when you're pregnant with another guy's baby?
CARRIE	If one more person asks me that today.
IRANDA	"I mean, I'm not in a relationship with the father of the baby or anything."
CARRIE	"I've rarely heard that used as a plus, but go on."
IRANDA	"It's just. Is it tacky? And beyond tacky, is it safe? Let's assume he's a really great fuck."
CARRIE	Because so many men are.
IRANDA	"Could all that poking shake the baby loose or something? No, that's silly. Married couples have sex all the time. But what if he's huge?"
CARRIE	"Again, 'cause so many men are."
IRANDA	Could the dick dent the baby?
CARRIE	where do You think dimples come from?
IRANDA	That is So cute.
CARRIE	I try.
IRANDA	"Okay, I really need to have sex with him now. Next time he comes back in town, I'll be too big and he won't want to. Nothing puts a man off sex like pregnancy. This is my last chance. Last chance for sex."
CARRIE	You're not on death row.
IRANDA	"Yes, I am, dead woman fucking."
CARRIE	"It's your body, your life. You do what's best for you."
IRANDA	Easier said than done. You should've aske Aidan not to talk when you walk in the front door.
CARRIE	"Hi, Mrs. Cohen! Hold on a second. Here, let me help you. Hold on, here we go. Hello. Okay?"
RS. COHEN	That's a crazy outfit.
CARRIE	"Okay, Mrs. Cohen, this is my friend, Miranda."
IRANDA	"Hello, Mrs. Cohen."
RS. COHEN	"Listen, you tell your boy I'm not leaving for 30 days."
CARRIE	What? But we're closing in a week.
RS. COHEN	Read the contract!
CARRIE	"I didn't think Mrs. Cohen could move any slower, but apparently she could."
AIDAN	"Gal, what's up? Where you been? What do you know?"
CARRIE	"Brace yourself, partner. I been outside, and what's up is Old Lightning Rod next door informs me she will not be leaving for 30 days."
AIDAN	I was afraid she was gonna do that. Fuck! Fuck! What the fuck are we gonna fucking do now?
CARRIE	"Thank you. You hate it, too, I'm so relieved! I thought you'd already changed into a pod. Invasion of the Single Snatchers."
AIDAN	"Of course I hate it. We cannot live like this. I mean, I got all my boxes in the hall. You can't get in the fucking door."
CARRIE	"I know, did you see me? Every time! Every single time!"
AIDAN	We gotta get this stuff out of here. We could make some room for it if we cleaned out your closet.
CARRIE	Careful!
AIDAN	"Okay, damn, my ears."
CARRIE	Listen to me. I have laid out clean towels on the floor of the bathroom. Gently place the shoes and boxes on them. I forgot I had these. Things are looking up.
AIDAN	how many pairs Of Shoes Does one person need?
CARRIE	That is not the way to get out Of this alive.
AIDAN	I figure I'm gonna need about half this space.
CARRIE	I figure you've gone mentally ill.
AIDAN	You never wear most Of this stuff.
CARRIE	
AIDAN	Like this? When and where were you planning to wear this?
CARRIE	"Don't do that. Don't mock the clothes. And for the record, have worn it. December, '99, Union Square, book signing."
AIDAN	we gotta start somewhere.
CARRIE	"come on, I love this outfit."
CARRIE	That's when I realized I was holding on to a Roberto Cavalla outfit and throwing away my relationship.
CARRIE	"Okay, it goes!"
AIDAN	Good.
CARRIE	"Bye. Pete! Hey, Pete! Stop it! Pete, stop it! Pete, my God! Pete, hey! Don't show it to me, don't even show it to me! I think I saw turquoise. That better not be the pair I think! Goddamn it! That dog owes me $380."
AIDAN	Fine.
CARRIE	"You can't buy it, it's circa 1996! Goddamn it!"
AIDAN	"He's a dog, what's he supposed to do? All your shit lying around here?"
CARRIE	My shit wouldn't be lying around if we weren't making room because your shit is lying around.
AIDAN	You got more shit lying around than I got lying around.
CARRIE	"What? Look at this place. It's loaded with your shit. Just look at this bathroom! Look at all your shit in my bathroom. Who needs five almost empty Speed stick deodorants? What are you, a crazy bag man?"
AIDAN	They're different smells!
CARRIE	"And when have you ever worn musk? Look at this stuff, you got old razors, Rogaine. Wait a minute. You use Rogaine? I didn't know you needed."
AIDAN	It's preventative!
CARRIE	is your hair falling out?
AIDAN	I don't want to talk about it!
CARRIE	It seems it's not only women who have Secret Single Behavior.
CARRIE	This is my stuff! Don't be going through my stuff.
AIDAN	You were more than happy to go through my stuff.
AIDAN	"Your stuff, your bathroom. You always do that, you never want to let me in."
CARRIE	I don't ''always do'' anything. And I have let you in.
AIDAN	You're fighting with me about a stupid fucking outfit!
CARRIE	Shut up! It's Roberto Cavalli. I threw it away and I love it! What more do you want?
AIDAN	Shut up! Shut up!
CARRIE	"Yes, shut up!"
AIDAN	You're telling me to shut up?
CARRIE	"Please, just shut up! I'm so sick of hearing you talking all the time! Don't you ever just shut up?"
AIDAN	I'm gonna take a walk.
CARRIE	No. I'm taking a walk! You can stay here with your boxes of shit and your shoe eating dog and you can knock yourself out putting on the Rogaine and the Speed stick! This is why I need a second door! I heard that!
CARRIE	"I used to think those people who sat alone at Starbucks writing on their laptops were pretentious poseurs. Now, I know. They're people who have recently moved in with someone. As I Looked around I wondered how many of them were mid-fight like myself. The hard thing about fighting in relationships, as opposed to Madison Square Garden, no referee. There's no one to tell you which comments are below the belt or when to go to your separate corners. As a result, someone usually gets hurt. And it seems, the closer a couple gets and the more ''stuff'' they have between them, the harder it is to figure out exactly why they are yelling. When it comes to relationships I couldn't help but wonder what are we fighting for?"
TREY	"Hello, my darling. I'm home!"
CHARLOTTE	What are you... is That a surprise for me?
TREY	"Yes, it is. Don't get all excited, it's just a little silly something."
CHARLOTTE	What is it?
TREY	"Open it. It's a cardboard baby. I saw it in the window of a novelty store next to the hospital. See, now we can relax because we have one. Oh, dear. It was supposed to be funny. I thought we'd have a chuckle."
CHARLOTTE	Don't talk to me.
TREY	"See, it was a novelty store. And the clerk said that they sell..."
CARRIE	"But to Charlotte, it was definitely hitting below the belt."
(TV CHATTER)	If the meat is about a quarter of an inch thick...
CARRIE	"And across town, Miranda decided it was time to put on the gloves and come out swinging."
WALKER	Leave a message.
IRANDA	"Hi, Walker, Miranda. Before you leave for Brussels on Monday, how about getting together Friday night? My apartment, call me."
CARRIE	"Pregnant or not, Miranda had needs and decided to stop fighting them."
CARRIE	"And surprisingly, Samantha developed some Secret Single Behavior of her own."
CARRIE	"Seven hours and a landside of lattes Later I vibrated home, prepared to admit how silly I'd been."
CARRIE	That was until he wasn't prepared to admit how silly he'd been.
CARRIE	"He yelled, then I yelled. It's been three days, and nothing. Not a word. And I'll be damned if I say I'm sorry first."
CHARLOTTE	"Trey and I hardly ever yell. We're Wasps. Wasps don't yell, it's genetic. Would anyone like more salad?"
IRANDA	"No, we're done, what's the main course?"
CARRIE	Relax. Chew. You'll get laid. You're not meeting until 10:00.
CHARLOTTE	Beef with Thai noodles.
SAMANTHA	Richard is thinking Of opening a hotel in Thailand.
CARRIE	Sweetie? It's perfectly Okay to like a guy.
SAMANTHA	"For the last time, the only thing I like about Richard is his big, throbbing, rock hard, perfect dick."
TREY	Forgot it was ladies' night.
CHARLOTTE	"Trey, you're not supposed to be here."
TREY	"good evening, everyone."
IRANDA	Hello. Hi.
TREY	"Hello, Mrs. Still mad, I see. I suppose she told you about the baby."
CHARLOTTE	"No, I didn't. I never want to think about it again."
TREY	See I was trying to make Charlotte laugh and ...
CHARLOTTE	It's not funny!
TREY	"Wait a minute now, maybe they'll think it's funny. See, we were so tense about not being able to have one that I gave Charlotte a cardboard baby. Isn't that funny? Carrie, you're funny. Cardboard baby, that's funny, right? I mean, it's not funny ''haha,'' but silly. See, they sell them in novelty stores and other people buy them, and the clerk said that it was funny. Maybe you have to see it."
CHARLOTTE	Don't you bring that thing in here!
TREY	It's silly.
CHARLOTTE	"Not to me it isn't! How would you feel if I gave you a cardboard cut out of a big flaccid penis? It's not so funny now, is it? Don't you bring that flat baby in here, I will kill you!"
TREY	How dare you talk to me like that in front of them?
CHARLOTTE	They know about your penis problems! They're sick of hearing it!
CARRIE	"There we were, right in the middle of a Wasp nest."
TREY	This is unforgivable!
CHARLOTTE	"No, what's unforgivable is you denying me my baby because of your own selfish, spoiled needs."
TREY	I'm spoiled?
CHARLOTTE	Yes!
TREY	"You are spoiled! Ever since we moved back in here, it's been nothing but ''baby, baby''! What about me?"
SAMANTHA	"Richard, hello. No, it's not too late to call."
CHARLOTTE	Everything but a baby!
CARRIE	We're gonna go.
TREY	Good!
CHARLOTTE	"Don't you talk to my friends like that! Without a baby, they're all I have!"
TREY	and What am I?
CHARLOTTE	You are the man who gave me a cardboard baby!
TREY	It was funny!
CHARLOTTE	"No, it wasn't!"
CARRIE	Goodnight!
SAMANTHA	"Okay, what's so important that it couldn't wait until..."
RICHARD	this.
SAMANTHA	Let's get something straight. I want no part of that. That turns everything into a big screaming mess. We are work and sex. Nothing more. Now kindly take off those pants and show me your dick.
RICHARD	I'll show you mine if you show me yours.
SAMANTHA	That's what I'm talking about.
CARRIE	Seeing a bantam-weight championship fight like Charlotte and Trey's made me thankful that Aidan and I were still in the banter-weight division.
CARRIE	I' m Sorry.
AIDAN	"I'm sorry, too."
CARRIE	"That night, I slept in my clothes. Trey and his baby slept in the guest room and Charlotte no longer cared what Trey thought."
IRANDA	Fuck me! Fuck me like there's no tomorrow.
CARRIE	"For her last meal, the condemned woman had seconds and thirds."
CARRIE	Samantha met the dawn after a night of S.S.B. Sexy Swimming Behavior.
RICHARD	Dance with me.
RICHARD	What did I say?
RICHARD	I'm your boss. It's an order.
SAMANTHA	Richard.
RICHARD	Dance with me.
CARRIE	"Samantha finally threw in the towel. All this time, she'd been trying to make him just a perfect dick, fighting her feelings that he might be the perfect Richard."
CARRIE	And back at the Bradshaw Shaw residence it was pretty much business as usual.
AIDAN	What's up? Where you been? Who did you see?
CARRIE	"Buddy, I need You to do something."
AIDAN	what?
CARRIE	"I've never lived with anybody before you, so I don't know how to say this correctly but I need you to not talk to me for one whole hour. I know that sounds pretty selfish but it's just what I need. Is that okay? Okay, good. We don't have any other rooms yet, so I'm gonna close these and then it's like I'm not here. For one whole hour, I'm not here. Thanks. I love you."
CARRIE	"So, what are you doing out here?"
CARRIE	"That's the thing about needs, sometimes when you get them met, you don't need them anymore."
CARRIE	"As our 30 days wore on, Aidan and I miraculously managed to not kill each other. But, as I predicted, the plant was not so lucky."
CARRIE	One of the best things about New York is that on any given night there are a million things to do.
CARRIE	One of the worst things about New York is trying to pick one.
AIDAN	"Those floors next door, they were in worse shape than yours."
CARRIE	"You want me to see if I can get us into Town? You know that restaurant in the Chambers hotel, with the period in the name, Town period. It's supposed to be amazing. Exclamation point."
AIDAN	You know What Sounds amazing to me?
CARRIE	what?
AIDAN	"Nice hot shower, watching the game. Bucket of K.F.C. Mashed potaters, biscuits."
CARRIE	But it's Saturday night.
AIDAN	"It's finger licking good. K period, F period, C period."
SAMANTHA	It's about fucking time. Get over here and do me!
CARRIE	Is that your standard greeting now?
SAMANTHA	"Sorry, I thought it was Richard. That asshole said he'd call in five minutes. That was four hours ago. I've been waiting by the phone."
CARRIE	My dinner might be arriving in a bucket. You want to go out?
SAMANTHA	Immediately. I'll conference the other girls.
CARRIE	You know how to do that?
SAMANTHA	how else do You have Three-way phone sex?
CHARLOTTE	Hello?
CARRIE	What are You doing?
TREY	MacDougal residence.
CHARLOTTE	It's for me! I've got it.
TREY	Good for you!
CHARLOTTE	It's the first time we talked today.
IRANDA	Hello?
CARRIE	We're going out.
IRANDA	Who's on the phone?
CHARLOTTE	All Of us. It's the future.
IRANDA	Why are You Guys calling me So late?
CARRIE	"It's 6:29, were You asleep?"
IRANDA	I'm pregnant. I'm always asleep. These are my last months of freedom. I'm spending them in bed.
SAMANTHA	Don't spend them alone in bed.
IRANDA	"I'm a lost cause, go on without me, save yourselves!"
CARRIE	"No, we're all going. We have to shake things up before we officially become boring."
CARRIE	I say we Go dancing.
SAMANTHA	I'm in.
CHARLOTTE	Let's go dancing!
IRANDA	Not where I'd feel worse when no one's interested because I'm fat.
CARRIE	You're not. You're pregnant.
IRANDA	"Yeah, that'll have men lining up at the door."
SAMANTHA	I know exactly where we should go.
CARRIE	"That night we finally answered the age old question: ''Where are all the hot guys?'' Well, the hot gay guys. They were at the hot gay club, Trade."
CHARLOTTE	I feel like we don't belong here.
CARRIE	That's because we're wearing shirts.
IRANDA	"Seriously, why don't straight men have bodies like this?"
CARRIE	"Because gay men have the possibility of sex at the gym. If straight men had that they'd be working out all the time, too."
SAMANTHA	I've had sex at the gym.
CARRIE	Samantha is doing her part to motivate the masses.
IRANDA	I'm going to the ladies' room.
SAMANTHA	"Me, too, I bet there's no line."
CARRIE	Wait. We'll meet you at the bar?
SAMANTHA	at the bar.
ANTHONY	Char!
CHARLOTTE	"My God, it's Anthony! Hi!"
ANTHONY	"Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing here?"
CHARLOTTE	We're shaking things up. You remember Carrie?
CARRIE	Hi!
ANTHONY	Love what you're almost wearing.
CHARLOTTE	"Sister, day-Glo Underwear, look into it."
ANTHONY	Are we gonna dance?
ANTHONY	"This is my friend, Gordon. He's a design editor for House and Garden."
CHARLOTTE	My God! I love that magazine! I used to wear my mother's pearls and flip through it when I was little.
GORDON	"Me, too."
CHARLOTTE	"I've got a great before apartment, if you're looking for an after."
ANTHONY	"You should see Char's apartment. It's Park Avenue, it's so frieaking gorgeous."
GORDON	We're doing an urban issue this spring. Maybe I should check it out.
CHARLOTTE	My God! If my apartment could be in H and G magazine I would be in heaven!
GORDON	You are pretty. You want to dance?
CHARLOTTE	Okay. So how long have You worked there?
ANTHONY	"Swell, I get Him All wound up, she cashes in."
CARRIE	are You two together?
ANTHONY	"No, but I'm hoping we will be around 3:30."
CARRIE	You're dirty.
ANTHONY	dance?
CARRIE	"No, I'm good. You kids go have fun."
ANTHONY	Okay.
CARRIE	Okay.
ANTHONY	Watch out for the fairy.
CARRIE	Which one?
IRANDA	"Attention gentlemen, ladies present!"
IRANDA	"Sorry. There's no ladies' room, because... Yeah, Excuse me. Thanks."
SAMANTHA	"Don't mind me, fellas. Just looking. Kinda like being a diabetic at Baskin Robbins."
CARRIE	"Sir? Hello! Excuse me! Over here. Hello, anybody!"
OLIVER	What do You need?
CARRIE	"A penis, evidently. I'm trying to order a dirty martini."
OLIVER	"Kurt, a dirty martini for the lovely and talented Carrie Bradshaw."
CARRIE	Thank you.
OLIVER	Oliver Spencer.
CARRIE	Hello.
OLIVER	"I've only been in the States six months, and regard your column as my New York survival guide."
CARRIE	"Oliver, you're a dead man. I have no idea what I'm talking about. What do you do?"
OLIVER	I'm a shoe distributor.
CARRIE	It Would be cruel to kid me.
OLIVER	"All the Top lines. Offices here, Sydney, and Milan."
CARRIE	"So, then You get a discount?"
OLIVER	for Special friends and columnists.
CARRIE	Thank you. Cheers!
OLIVER	"Cheers to you! Hello, what's this?"
CARRIE	what?
OLIVER	that.
CARRIE	"Oh, this. I keep forgetting I'm engaged."
OLIVER	"You can't go off the market, you're my dating guru."
CARRIE	I'm still allowed to see other gays.
OLIVER	You must allow me to take you to brunch. I'll give you my card. Can you hold this for a moment?
CARRIE	"Sure. What's this, a goody bag?"
OLIVER	"Of course, I was at a film release party earlier."
CARRIE	Jox and Cocks four.
OLIVER	I was told it's a Merchant Ivory film.
CARRIE	"Would I be able to enjoy this if I missed Jox and Cocks One, Two and Three?"
OLIVER	"Yes, but you'd want to see those eventually. Very important films."
IRANDA	Max! Hi!
CARRIE	"Max was a junior associate at Miranda's law firm and, apparently, gay."
IRANDA	I had No idea.
AX	I had no idea you were a gay man either!
IRANDA	"I'm here with friends. And there's no ladies' room, because... yeah."
AX	"Yeah. Listen, Miranda, I'd kind of prefer if we didn't make an issue out of this at work. I'm not in the closet. I just wouldn't want the older partners to start treating me differently, so..."
IRANDA	"I totally understand. And between you and me, I'm pregnant."
AX	And unwed. Perhaps you should spend less time in gay clubs. Seriously good for you.
IRANDA	"Remains to be seen. Anyhow, I haven't told anybody at work, because goodbye to all the good cases and then it's only a matter of time before the buzzards start vying for my office."
AX	It is a very nice office.
IRANDA	I'm coming here every week!
CHARLOTTE	Excuse me. What did I miss?
IRANDA	I peed in a men's room and outed a coworker.
CARRIE	I got a phone Number and some porn.
SAMANTHA	I saw two dicks and took a hit of ''X.''
IRANDA	to think That I almost slept through this.
CHARLOTTE	I can't believe you took ecstasy from a stranger.
SAMANTHA	He wasn't a stranger! He's a friend of my friend Bobby's friend Bobby.
IRANDA	"Then, you know it's safe. Will we be going to a rave later?"
SAMANTHA	"No, but I might have to drop in on Richard. Sex on ''X'' is supposed to be amazing. It releases all of your inhibitions."
CHARLOTTE	You have inhibitions?
CARRIE	"my God, Look."
SAMANTHA	Three dicks and counting!
CARRIE	They say opposites attract. What they fail to mention is that opposites also tend to have opposite views on what constitutes a rockin' Saturday night.
AIDAN	How was your night?
CARRIE	"I've got a goody bag. Know what's in it? C'mon, I had to fight a foreigner for it."
AIDAN	Come here. Just tuck in here and let's go to sleep.
CARRIE	I'm not tired yet.
AIDAN	You will be.
CARRIE	"Hey you, I had five Cocktails. I danced with a lot of fine half naked men. If you would wake up right now I can almost guarantee you'd be in for some FUN."
AIDAN	"I ate too much chicken, I think. Will you rub my belly, baby?"
CARRIE	"I know it was wrong to compare but I felt like I had spent the evening in a Calvin Klein ad and now I was back to baseball, buckets, and BVDs."
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, Samantha was having excellent sex."
SAMANTHA	"That was amazing. You are amazing. I love you, Richard. I am in love with you."
CARRIE	You told Him You loved him?
SAMANTHA	It was the ''X'' talking! All I wanted to do was to have sex!
CARRIE	"Okay, and then What did he say?"
SAMANTHA	"Nothing, he Just went to sleep."
CARRIE	Is it possible he didn't hear you?
SAMANTHA	"He heard me. Can I get a fucking cab? If he was any kind of gentleman at all, he'd pretend it never happened."
CARRIE	"But You did have sex, right?"
SAMANTHA	Of course we had sex.
CARRIE	Aidan and I didn't. He fell asleep and I watched gay porn.
SAMANTHA	"See, that's what happens when people say, ''I love you!''"
CARRIE	do You love him?
SAMANTHA	who the hell knows?
CARRIE	Maybe the ''X'' knows.
SAMANTHA	"It makes you giddy. I was in love with the Taxi driver, the doorman, his sweater."
CARRIE	But you only said it to Richard.
SAMANTHA	"I am never taking ''X'' again. It is a dangerous, dangerous drug."
CARRIE	That afternoon I was high on another feel good drug: the new gay friend.
OLIVER	Could You be more fantastic?
CARRIE	They say you can't meet men in bars.
OLIVER	That was true for me last night. I went to Trade hoping to meet someone for just a shag because I've a boyfriend in Sydney. And the only person I met was you. Not that I'm disappointed.
CARRIE	And your boyfriend doesn't mind if you date other men?
OLIVER	"not date, have sex with."
CARRIE	"Right, the international gay rules."
OLIVER	"Absolutely. Blow jobs only, no last names. The gym is a free space and never ever show up at the same place wearing the same shirt. I just crossed over into a whole other set of rules."
CARRIE	"You've certainly worked out more options than ''Till death do us part.'' That's all we've come up with, and frankly, I find it a little limiting."
OLIVER	I know gay couples who are monogamous. But I'm a realist. I don't expect to get everything from one man. But I guess I shouldn't be saying this to someone wearing a ring.
CARRIE	What's with you and this ring?
OLIVER	What's with you and the ring? You haven't even mentioned him.
CARRIE	Aidan.
OLIVER	What's Aidan like?
CARRIE	He's very tall and incredibly kind. And handsome.
OLIVER	"So, why would you leave that at home on a Saturday night?"
CARRIE	He wanted to stay in and listen to sports with a bucket of chicken.
OLIVER	He would have made my dad so proud. Have you been to Bungalow Eight yet?
CARRIE	"No. But I hear it's a pretentious, members only, tiny, crowded club that you need a key to get into."
OLIVER	I have a key.
CARRIE	when are we going?
STANFORD	If it isn't little Carrie Bradshaw.
CARRIE	
STANFORD	"At the moment, confused. Who's this?"
CARRIE	"Oliver Spencer, Stanford Blatch."
OLIVER	"Pleasure to meet you. I don't mean to be rude, but I must go to the men's room."
STANFORD	"I've just been, you'll love it."
OLIVER	Really?
CARRIE	I'll be right here.
OLIVER	I'll be right back.
STANFORD	So?
CARRIE	Yes?
OLIVER	I saw the way you were behaving. You're sleeping with the beautiful man.
CARRIE	the Beautiful man is gay.
OLIVER	
CARRIE	He's only been in New York for about six months. I picked him up at Trade.
STANFORD	You went to shirtless heaven without me?
CARRIE	It wasn't the same.
STANFORD	I was prepared to lose you to Aidan. But this...
CARRIE	is Just brunch.
STANFORD	I'm green with envy.
CARRIE	"Yes, You are."
STANFORD	"Fine! Have your beautiful brunch with your beautiful man and then go home to your other beautiful man. Greedy, greedy, greedy."
CARRIE	"Later, I started to think about restlessness and relationships. Once we found what we've been searching for, why are some of us reluctant to let go of our single selves? Is single life in New York such a constant flurry of fun and friends that settling down immediately fills us with the urge to shake things up again? And why does becoming part of a couple imply settling down? Maybe Oliver does have the key. We shouldn't expect to get everything from one man but instead, feel comfortable getting different things from different people. Although, at what point do separate interests become separate bedrooms? I couldn't help but wonder, to be in a couple do you have to put your single self on a shelf?"
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, Miranda's workaholic single self was a thing of the past. Now, she was sleeping for two."
CELESTE	"It's finally happening. Stern, Hawkins, Erickson is moving into the future."
IRANDA	"Excuse me, what? We're moving?"
CELESTE	"Casual Friday. The entire partnership finally okayed it, finally. I've been working on this for what, two years now?"
IRANDA	"Right, great."
CELESTE	"Yeah, Thanks. and Congratulations."
IRANDA	did You Tell Celeste I was pregnant?
AX	"Okay, Yes, But Only in your defense."
IRANDA	what?
AX	"This morning she was telling everyone how she saw you sleeping on your desk a couple of times, that you might be an alcoholic, bipolar, or something."
IRANDA	You told her I was pregnant?
AX	Isn't That better?
IRANDA	"No, not at a law firm, no."
AX	"Sorry, I told her It was a secret."
IRANDA	She can't keep a secret. She's probably told everybody in the office by now. How would you like it if I told everybody in the office that you were gay?
CELESTE	Casual Friday has arrived.
AX	great. Maybe Next You can call my grandparents.
CHARLOTTE	this is gay porn.
IRANDA	What was your first clue?
CHARLOTTE	You said we were watching an independent film. I brought biscotti.
CARRIE	"Relax, I've watched it already, and I'm telling you, this is really funny."
SAMANTHA	"See, that's the way to do it. No ''I love you,'' just good old-fashioned fucking."
CHARLOTTE	I am not in the mood for gay porn.
CARRIE	not in the mood for gay porn?
IRANDA	Don't you want to know how it ends?
CHARLOTTE	House and Garden wants to shoot my apartment. I told Trey and he doesn't care.
IRANDA	We turned off porn to talk about a magazine?
IRANDA	"Biscotti, please."
CHARLOTTE	He never cares about what I want. Anthony is more excited about it than Trey is.
SAMANTHA	"That's because gay men understand what's important. Clothes, compliments, and Cocks. And clubs."
CARRIE	Oliver's taking me to Bungalow Eight tomorrow night.
IRANDA	Sounds like you're cheating on Aidan with a gay man.
CARRIE	"No, that's allowed. Gay boyfriends are the loophole of monogamy."
IRANDA	"My gay boyfriend outed me at work, then I outed him. Even my gay relationships are dysfunctional."
CARRIE	"Okay, here's the problem. Aidan loves to stay in, and I love to go out."
CHARLOTTE	And he's fine with that.
CARRIE	"It's either the greatest relationship ever, or we're headed..."
CHARLOTTE	"For separate bedrooms, like me. We're in completely different places. Trey's content with what we have. Therefore, I am a bad person for needing to have a baby."
CARRIE	You're not a bad person. You're a person with needs.
CHARLOTTE	This is making me depressed. Let's watch that movie.
SAMANTHA	I thought you'd never ask.
CARRIE	"The next morning, Samantha and Richard were taking care of business, but not each other."
RICHARD	I'm not doing any more charity crap if we can't get publicity. Steve Martin was there and he's the toast of New York.
SAMANTHA	He's the toast of The New Yorker. There's a difference. Are we gonna talk about this?
RICHARD	about what?
SAMANTHA	That thing I said the other night.
RICHARD	"Samantha, you were high on ''X.'' Believe me, I've been there."
SAMANTHA	
CARRIE	"Once Richard made it clear that her ''I love you'' didn't matter, Samantha realized she was secretly wishing it did."
RICHARD	"So, you'll yell at The Times?"
SAMANTHA	I already did.
RICHARD	did You need something else?
SAMANTHA	no.
CARRIE	She wanted to tell him it wasn't just the drug talking that night. But she put her real feelings on the shelf.
SAMANTHA	Fuck you at my place around 8:00?
RICHARD	Sounds Good.
CARRIE	Charlotte and Trey's separate interests had become more than separate bedrooms. They'd become a real separation.
TREY	Pretty.
CHARLOTTE	They're for the photo shoot tomorrow. They're coming at 10:00. Would you please move your stuff out of the guest room?
TREY	Are they photographing the guest room?
CHARLOTTE	I don't know. But it doesn't look very good with us sleeping in separate bedrooms.
TREY	"No, it doesn't, does it?"
CHARLOTTE	"they want us to dress nicely, But not Too formal."
TREY	I'm in the picture?
CHARLOTTE	they want to photograph both Of us.
TREY	Why?
CHARLOTTE	"Because they think we're the perfect couple. I know. But I promised, and they're coming."
TREY	I don't want to do this.
CHARLOTTE	"It's just one picture, and it's important to me."
TREY	"No, this. I don't want to do this anymore. You are so angry at me."
CHARLOTTE	"I'm sorry. I want a baby. I thought that's what you wanted, too."
TREY	So did l.
CHARLOTTE	I don't think I should have to give that up.
TREY	You shouldn't. You can have the apartment. I'll move back in with mother.
CHARLOTTE	Okay.
CARRIE	"Charlotte and Trey's separate interests had become more than separate bedrooms. They'd become a real separation. Meanwhile, I tried to find a way for my single self and my couple self to co-exist."
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, I tried to find a way for my single self and my couple self to co-exist."
AIDEN	There you go. Yowza! Where are you going all dressed up like that?
CARRIE	I told You yesterday I was going out.
AIDEN	You didn't say you were going all out.
CARRIE	I have to see Bungalow eight.
AIDEN	"Yeah, what's that, a play?"
CARRIE	"No, it's a very hot club. It's important that I know about these things. Some people consider my column the New York survival guide."
AIDEN	What's going on here?
CARRIE	It's just something I'm trying. It's closer to my heart this way.
AIDEN	"who are You going out with, the girls?"
CARRIE	"this guy, Oliver Spencer."
AIDEN	a Guy?
CARRIE	He's gay.
AIDEN	"Cool. Listen, I am done for the night. So, you want me to jump in the shower, come with?"
CARRIE	I don't know. I don't know if he can get us both in.
AIDEN	What do You mean? we can get in anywhere.
CARRIE	You need a key Or something.
AIDEN	A key? Give me a fuckin' break.
CARRIE	"see, That kind Of attitude is not appreciated at Bungalow eight."
AIDEN	"Come on, a key? Why do you even buy into that shit? Let's just go out to dinner, I haven't seen you all week."
CARRIE	I can't. I told Oliver...
AIDEN	"All right. Don't forget your key, because we're very exclusive here, and we might not let you back in."
CARRIE	"See, now I feel bad. I basically discouraged him from coming."
OLIVER	call and have Him join us.
CARRIE	this is So not his scene.
OLIVER	"Then you have to break it off. This is Bungalow Eight, darling!"
CARRIE	"Right, what's a relationship compared to a night with trendy strangers?"
OLIVER	Oliver Spencer and date.
CARRIE	I'm your date?
CARRIE	Turns out there's one problem with having a handsome gay man as your date. Other handsome gay men.
AN	I Just love those New Prada open toed sandals.
OLIVER	I think I can get You a pair Of those.
AN	Really?
OLIVER	What size?
AN	Eleven.
CARRIE	"So, Ollie? Is there anything to eat at Bungalow Eight? Or is food so very last year? Okay, it seems you're in the middle of a spa session, so..."
OLIVER	"Wait, you're going?"
CARRIE	"You know, I left a gorgeous man at home to come here and be your date. And I'm guessing size 11 did as well. So, I'm just not really sure why I'm here."
OLIVER	"Because you're fantastic, and I'm sorry I was neglecting you. I'm very bad. Kiss and make up?"
STANFORD 	If it isn't Mr. and Mrs. Down Under.
CARRIE	I was so preoccupied with my gay boyfriend I kept forgetting about my gay husband.
CARRIE	"You remember Stanford, from brunch?"
STANFORD	"Apparently, It was more than Just brunch."
STANFORD 	"Don't fall for him, he's just another pretty face. He doesn't love you like I do. I knew this woman when she took the subway and wore candies."
OLIVER	Candies?
CARRIE	"I assure You, I never wore candies."
STANFORD 	"You wore pink suede candies, and I adored you anyway. And how dare you try to steal her away with your dreamy eyes and your probably fake accent?"
OLIVER	I'm sorry; I didn't realize the lady was spoken for.
STANFORD 	she is.
OLIVER	"All Right, then."
OLIVER	kiss and make up?
CARRIE	"And then I realized, my single self life had a shelf life, and it had just expired."
CARRIE	"Okay, I'm going."
OLIVER	"No, Carrie, stay. we Only Just got here. let me buy You another drink."
CARRIE	"No, it's fine, I just want to go home."
CARRIE	"And the surprising thing was, I did."
CARRIE	"Honey, I'm home."
AIDEN	how was the Bungalow?
CARRIE	I've seen better.
AIDEN	Why do You own Jox and Cocks four?
CARRIE	more research for the survival guide?
AIDEN	Really? What did You learn?
CARRIE	"Oh, Yeah. Give me some Of that."
AIDEN	a big Thank You to our gay friends.
CARRIE	"That's the thing about Manhattan. The most exclusive clubs only have a couple members and they're very hard to find. The next morning, House and Garden came to Charlotte's house."
ANTHONY	"It's fork, fork, knife, spoon. What are these people, crazy?"
GORDON	This is perfect. It's very Upper East Side breakfast for two. I love this china.
ANTHONY 	"me, too."
CHARLOTTE	"Thanks, it's our wedding china. Anthony, can I talk to you a minute?"
ANTHONY	We'll be right back. Is he cute or what?
CHARLOTTE	Trey and I...
ANTHONY	"Splitting up, I knew it."
CHARLOTTE	"Anyway I don't think he's gonna be in the picture. So, should we just cancel?"
ANTHONY	"Cancel? H and G, House and Garden? Do it without him."
CHARLOTTE	"Won't that look bad, just me?"
ANTHONY	"It'll look beautiful. He may be the heart surgeon. But you're the heart of this whole operation. Honestly, you're the best catch ever. Look what you did to this place. You could take any guy off the street, fix him up and make him into something wonderful. Not for nothing. But you deserve more than that stick-up-his-ass preppy. That's all I'm saying. Now get in here and have breakfast. Gordon, it's just gonna be..."
TREY	"All Right, we Ready for the picture?"
ANTHONY	one minute.
CHARLOTTE	"Trey, you don't have to..."
TREY	no. this is important to you. I at least want to do this.
GORDON	"Handsome husband, beautiful wife. Having breakfast! Smile."
CARRIE	"Trey had moved out by the time the magazine was on the stands. But all over America, little girls in their mothers' pearls saw the picture and thought, ""That's what I want."" That's the thing about relationships. Sometimes they look prettier from the outside. And what's inside can be different than it seems."
CARRIE	"When a marriage breaks up, there are numerous ways to cope. You can cry. You can move."
CHARLOTTE	"It's left right, not right left."
CARRIE	"Or, as Charlotte did, dive into a new routine. A tap routine."
CHARLOTTE	I feel good. I even signed up for sculpture and tap dancing class.
CARRIE	Because you can't do one without the other.
CHARLOTTE	"And everyone keeps telling me to take time to grieve. I don't need time. This divorce is going to be clean and swift, like pulling off a Band-Aid."
SUSAN SHARON	"Carrie! My God, I thought that was you."
CARRIE	"There it was, the unmistakable voice of Susan Sharon."
SUSAN SHARON	What's new? What's going on with you?
CARRIE	"Same old, same old. Just writing, gallivanting, eating. You know, the usual."
CHARLOTTE	Carrie!
CARRIE	what?
CHARLOTTE	You're forgetting the most important thing. They're engaged!
CARRIE	I'm engaged!
SUSAN SHARON	"You're getting married! My God! Aidan! Okay. Let me see, where's the..."
CARRIE	"It's here, it's right here."
SUSAN SHARON	Why is it around your neck? Is that what the people are doing these days? I'm so out of it.
CARRIE	"No, it's just me. It's closer to my heart this way."
SUSAN SHARON	"So, spring wedding? Fall wedding? Where are you doing it?"
CARRIE	"God, we haven't even begun to think about that stuff."
SUSAN SHARON	"You'd better chop chop, missy. Because these places book up, I'm telling you, years and years. Okay, anyway, the wedding."
CARRIE	"The next morning, a hotel mogul and his publicist began another grueling day at work."
SAMANTHA	can I help you?
RICHARD	You're gorgeous.
SAMANTHA	Tell me something I don't know.
CARRIE	"As intimate as their personal affair had become, when it came to their business affairs, Samantha remained cool and professional, in theory."
J.J. MITCHELL	J.J. Mitchell.
SAMANTHA	"J.J., Samantha Jones. I have your column in my hand and I'm very disappointed."
J.J. MITCHELL	"Jonesy, I thought you'd be sucking my dick for getting Richard's name in the paper."
SAMANTHA	We'll talk about your dick in a second. Richard canoodling with Bebe London? That's bullshit. I know he's canoodling with one woman and it's not Bebe London.
J.J. MITCHELL	"Okay, guess which hotheaded publicist can't seem to keep track of her own client?"
SAMANTHA	Guess which two-bit gossip columnist is talking out of his ass?
J.J. MITCHELL	"Believe me, I'd rather be talking out of your ass. So, just say the word... Jonesy?"
SAMANTHA	"J.J. Mitchell's column said you were canoodling with Bebe London. He's an idiot, just giving you a heads-up."
RICHARD	"All Press is good Press, right?"
SAMANTHA	"So, You were canoodling with Bebe London?"
RICHARD	is That a problem?
SAMANTHA	no. I Just need to get All the facts So I can do my job.
RICHARD	Why don't you take a break from your job and get that sexy ass in here?
CARRIE	"In an effort to drown out thoughts of Richard canoodling with Bebe London, Samantha focused on her own caboodle."
CARRIE	And in a more modest shower uptown...
CARRIE	"Excuse me, have we met?"
AIDAN	"Can I get in there? The Sheetrock guy is coming in 10 minutes. It's really coming along over there. Walls are coming down, washer dryer's on the way."
CARRIE	I forgot about the washer and dryer. I've been dreaming of that my whole New York life.
AIDAN	Here's something else for you to chew on.
CARRIE	What's that?
AIDAN	how about Hawaii?
CARRIE	"As what, the 50th state?"
AIDAN	"As in, we get hitched. We grab a couple friends, down some mai tais, tie the knot. You know, we can get ''Maui'd.''"
CARRIE	"Buddy, did You Just pun in the nude?"
AIDAN	Yeah.
CARRIE	What did I Tell You about that? Give me the soap.
AIDAN	What do You think?
CARRIE	"What, about Hawaii?"
AIDAN	Yeah.
CARRIE	"Come on, do I look like the ''Hang10,'' ''Surf' sup'' kind of bride to you? 'Cause I really think my grass skirt days are over."
AIDAN	"Okay, how about Aspen? Christmas time in Aspen. You, me, a polar bear, a judge. How's that sound?"
CARRIE	"For a shower with so little water pressure, I suddenly felt a ton of it beating down on my shoulders."
TAMMY	"And here's the spine, right here. Isn't that incredible? Here's the heart beating. See?"
IRANDA	Kind of. I think so.
TAMMY	"Okay. do You want to know the sex? I can Tell You Right now, if You do."
IRANDA	Okay.
TAMMY	sure? It's a boy. It's a boy. how do You feel?
IRANDA	
IRANDA	I Just faked a sonogram.
CARRIE	I'm sorry?
IRANDA	"I was lying there, the technician's giving me a guided tour of my uterus, then she tells me I'm having a boy."
CARRIE	My God! You're having a boy?
IRANDA	"You see? That. That's what this woman wanted out of me, but I couldn't get it up for her. So, I faked it."
CARRIE	What exactly does a fake sonogram look like in case I ever need to do it?
IRANDA	Everyone else is glowing about my pregnancy. When will I?
CARRIE	"I get the same thing every time someone hears I'm engaged. I'm supposed to be all excited about picking a date, and a place, and a theme. And I just want to lie down and take a big nap. I feel like a deadbeat bride."
IRANDA	"So, don't do all that stupid stuff. Fuck them."
CARRIE	"I better do something soon because I'm getting the distinct feeling my Grace period is OVER. I don't even want to look for a dress. Me, no dress! What's wrong here?"
IRANDA	"Maybe it's like the dentist. You put it off and put it off, and then you finally go and afterwards you feel great."
CARRIE	"God, I have to go to the dentist."
IRANDA	"Okay, wait. I'm having a radical idea here. There's a horrible bridal shop a couple of blocks away."
IRANDA	We could go.
CARRIE	How do you even know this?
IRANDA	"Because every time I pass by it, I go ''blech.'' We could run in, you could try on the worst dress they have, just face the dragon, get it over with. And then I'll treat you to a Tasti Delite. It's like aversion shock therapy."
CARRIE	You want me to try on a bad wedding dress? You're gonna have to do a lot better than Tasti Delite.
IRANDA	I'll try one on too?
CARRIE	Woo!
IRANDA	Hi!
CARRIE	Hello.
RITA	ladies.
CARRIE	My friend Miranda here is getting married. So we're looking for something special and we're in kind of a hurry.
IRANDA	And for Carrie here we're thinking of something with a lot of bows very frilly and poofy. We want her to look like a giant cupcake.
RITA	"I'm sorry, which one of you is getting married?"
CARRIE	"We both are. We do everything together. And right now, Miranda has everything but the gown. And the groom."
IRANDA	Whoops!
RITA	Okay. is this a lesbian wedding?
CARRIE	"No, it's a very straight-laced, conservative crowd. Lots of Wall Street types."
RITA	I'll see what I can find. Come with me.
CARRIE	your rehearsal dinner is gonna rock.
CARRIE	"Okay, on the count of three. One, two..."
CARRIE	look at you.
IRANDA	"Stop, I'm going to pee in this thing. Look at you!"
CARRIE	Look at yourself!
IRANDA	"Hold Still, You need a veil. You need a veil."
IRANDA	"Look, look. I look beautiful. You can't even tell I'm pregnant in this. The sleeves balance out the tummy. Don't you think it's kind of fetching?"
CARRIE	"My God. This is too tight, I can't breathe. Can you get it off me?"
IRANDA	are You kidding?
CARRIE	"No, I'm not kidding!"
IRANDA	You don't want the woman to come back in here.
CARRIE	I'm not kidding. Get it off! I'm burning up. I can't breathe!
IRANDA	"I'm sorry! There are a million buttons back here! My God, your back is all red."
CARRIE	"Just get it off, just rip it off!"
IRANDA	my god. What Just happened?
CARRIE	"I can't do it, I can't get married."
CHARLOTTE	this is All your fault.
SAMANTHA	how Could You take her to That dump?
IRANDA	It was an experiment. It went awry.
CHARLOTTE	"Okay, let's just slow down. This is classic cold feet. Let's not do anything rash."
CARRIE	"Rash, yes exactly, rash. Look at this. My body is literally rejecting the idea of marriage. Look!"
SAMANTHA	"Once you get a rash from a guy, It's time to heave ho."
CARRIE	"No, it's not him, it's me. I'm missing the bride gene. I should be put in a test tube and studied."
SAMANTHA	"It's not just you, I don't want to get married."
CHARLOTTE	Ever?
CARRIE	"Why do we even have to get married? Why? Give me one good reason. Aside from the not wanting to diea lone thing. Which is something to think about, I admit."
CHARLOTTE	"For me, when it was good, it gave me a sense of security."
CARRIE	"But I feel secure now. Things are great with us. You know what they say, â€˜â€˜If it ain't broke, ''"
SAMANTHA	Don't marry it.
IRANDA	What are You afraid Would change?
CARRIE	I don't know. Nothing. Everything.
CHARLOTTE	every bride feels That way at one point.
CARRIE	Why aren't they speaking up?
IRANDA	"Carrie, I'm going to ask you an unpleasant question now. Why did you ever say yes?"
CARRIE	"Because I love him. A man you love, kneels in the street and offers you a ring, you say yes."
CARRIE	That's what you do.
SAMANTHA	"You get married, you hope for the best. It doesn't work out, you get divorced. You can take tap with Bo Jangles here."
CARRIE	"No, I can't take a vow of forever and ever, if what I mean is for the foreseeable future. I can't do that to Aidan."
IRANDA	Talk to him about it.
CARRIE	"How do you talk about this? ''Aidan, what's up? ''I've just been thinking, having some doubts about the whole 'I do' thing.'' It'll break his heart. I should never have said yes. I'm a bad person."
IRANDA	"It's amazing. in a courtroom, reasonable doubt can get you off for murder. In an engagement, it makes you feel like a bad person."
CHARLOTTE	"Look, everyone has anxiety around weddings. Maybe your anxiety threshold is just lower than other people's."
CARRIE	Interesting theory. You think that dress is still outside the dumpster at Tasti Delite?
CARRIE	After being hit by a bridal wave I tried to get my mind around the concept of happily ever after.
CARRIE	"As progressive as our society claims to be, there are still certain life targets we're all supposed to hit. Marriage, babies, and a home to call your own. But what if, instead of breaking out in a smile, you break out in a rash? Is something wrong with the system? Or is it you? And do we really want these things? Or are we just programmed? In a crisis, people always tell you to listen to your gut. Mine was telling me to start smoking again."
CARRIE	"Hi. Marlboro Lights, please."
CARRIE	But I decided not to throw it all away.
CARRIE	You know what? Actually. Just these.
CARRIE	"Later, while Aidan worked on the apartment next door, I worked on reprogramming my attitude. Could I be a spring bride? Happy bride? Peek-a-boo bride?"
CARRIE	"Stop! Stop, Aidan, stop it! Aidan! I'm freaking out. I can't, l. I cannot. I am having a very strong reaction to all this change."
AIDAN	"Okay, just don't freak out."
CARRIE	
AIDAN	The hole? I told you I was gonna come through there...
CARRIE	It's not just the hole!
AIDAN	what?
CARRIE	It's the marriage stuff. I love you and I'm sorry if I'm not supposed to talk to you about this. But I have to.
AIDAN	Come here. Just sit down on the floor. What's happening?
CARRIE	I didn't want to say anything but then that thing came through my wall. I don't think that I'm ready to get married yet. Do you hate me?
AIDAN	"No, come on. You're catching me a little off guard here."
CARRIE	"I know, I just..."
AIDAN	I hear you. I need a minute here. Is it because I said we could get ''Maui'd''?
CARRIE	Thank you for making a joke.
AIDAN	"Let's slow it down. Okay, how much time do you need? Six months? Nine months? The end of the year?"
CARRIE	Which year?
AIDAN	"So, You Just need some time?"
CARRIE	Yeah. I think so.
AIDAN	Okay. We'll get there.
CARRIE	"Thank You, Aidan. Thank You for listening."
AIDAN	did You see the washer and dryer?
CARRIE	I love you.
CARRIE	"The next day, Miranda enjoyed a few moments of solitude with her bills and her cleaning lady."
IRANDA	"Magda? I'm going to pay you for a whole month, okay?"
AGDA	Look what I found on the kitchen counter. It's beautiful! Did they tell you boy or girl?
IRANDA	"Yes, it's a boy."
AGDA	"A boy! A boy! A boy is coming into the house. A boy is highest blessing, It's good luck. Smile. Smile for a boy."
IRANDA	A boy!
AGDA	A boy!
CARRIE	"And while Miranda had tea for one, Charlotte was mastering Tea for Two."
PAT	"We're coming across the floor with me. Step shuffle step for you, step shuffle step for me. And now, two by two. Go! Next pair. Nice! Very nice."
PAT	"You, in the flowers go!"
CHARLOTTE	I don't have a partner.
PAT	Just go it alone. And go!
CHARLOTTE	I don't want to go it alone.
PAT	"You'll be fine. Come on, flowers. Picture me upon your knee."
CHARLOTTE	"I can't do this, I'm sorry, I can't. And I shouldn't have to. I deserve a real partner. And this song is abusive and hurtful."
VIOLA	Should I stop?
CHARLOTTE	You should think about how a person would feel who's going through a very difficult divorce and who just comes here to have fun and feel good about themselves!
CARRIE	"In her attempt to skip over her grief, Charlotte tapped into her pain."
CARRIE	"The next week, we all put on our finest and gathered at the Black and White Ball, Richard's charity fundraiser."
CHARLOTTE	Aidan looks So handsome in a tux.
CARRIE	Yeah.
IRANDA	How's he doing?
CARRIE	"Good, good. Still a little thrown about the change in plans, but good. I just hope I did the right thing."
IRANDA	You followed your feelings. That's always the right thing to do. I'm drinking seltzer and I'm in a formal gown with an elastowaist. I really fit in here.
CARRIE	Do you realize you're growing a teeny tiny penis inside you? That's so sci-fi.
CHARLOTTE	My God! You're having a boy? Aren't you so excited?
AIDAN	Two glasses of French fizz here and a sody for you.
CHARLOTTE	Did you know that Miranda's having a boy?
IRANDA	I think I'm going to hurt myself.
SAMANTHA	"I trust you're finding something noteworthy to put in your column, J.J.?"
J.J. MITCHELL	Look at you. I can think of other places I'd like to put my column tonight.
SAMANTHA	"Dream on, J.J."
J.J. MITCHELL	"Never hurts to ask, right? I'm sure you know this one, but guess which hotel king is having very private relations with a very public New York woman?"
SAMANTHA	I guess the cat's out of the bag.
J.J. MITCHELL	"It's out of the bag. Look at them together. That Judith McBain, she's insatiable. Word is they've done it in every one of his hotels."
SAMANTHA	Excuse me.
J.J. MITCHELL	"good chatting with You, Jonesy."
CARRIE	"Samantha could handle the press, but she couldn't the truth."
CARRIE	"The fucking Richard is fucking the entire styles section and for the first time in my life, I actually give a shit. I think I have monogamy. I must've caught it from you people."
CARRIE	It's airborne.
SAMANTHA	There are a lot of hot guys but I don't want to fuck a single one of them. Not him or him.
AIDAN	What about this guy over here? He asked me if I knew you.
SAMANTHA	"Who? No, I'm not interested. Damn it, I'm not well."
CHARLOTTE	At least you're not getting divorced.
CARRIE	Just Tell Richard how You feel.
SAMANTHA	"I can't do that. He likes me because I'm supposed to be immune to this bullshit. There goes that Judith Bitchy-Mc-Bitch heading for Richard. Okay, I'm going to go over there and I'm going to be completely calm, and completely professional."
CARRIE	"Every day, millions of people suffer from monogamy. There is no known cure."
SAMANTHA	I'm so sorry.
RICHARD	"Hey, gorgeous. Great turnout."
SAMANTHA	This is purely professional. Exactly how many women are you fucking?
RICHARD	"It's the ''Black and White'' Ball, not the ''black and blue'' Ball."
SAMANTHA	"As your publicist, I must tell you all this canoodling and bed hopping is tacky and immature. It makes investors nervous, and frankly..."
RICHARD	"It makes you nervous, too."
SAMANTHA	"As your publicist, yes, it does. So, grow up. Stop fucking other women. Just fuck me."
RICHARD	"Come on, we're not the monotonous, I mean, monogamous type."
SAMANTHA	Maybe I am.
RICHARD	"Gorgeous, I'm not."
SAMANTHA	Fine.
J.J. MITCHELL	"Jonesy, you get any good dish for me?"
CARRIE	"In fact, she did. Samantha gave J.J. an exclusive just to prove to herself that she was not."
SAMANTHA	What the...
J.J. MITCHELL	
CARRIE	"It wasn't the first time a guy went soft on Samantha, but it was the first time she didn't care."
J.J. MITCHELL	"Jonesy, I can't believe this is happening. This never happens to me. I can give a list of women who this has never happened with."
SAMANTHA	That wouldn't be necessary.
J.J. MITCHELL	"No, I want to, I want you to call Anna Bonnie at 9577297 or Lisa Yelling at 459..."
RICHARD	"There you are. Listen, maybe I was too quick back there. If there's anyone who could keep monotony interesting..."
J.J. MITCHELL	Man of the hour.
RICHARD	You'll never change. And I wouldn't want you to. Let's just keep things as they were.
SAMANTHA	This doesn't count. He couldn't even stay hard.
RICHARD	"good seeing You, J.J."
SAMANTHA	"Don't say it, limp dick."
J.J. MITCHELL	Okay.
CARRIE	That's a very good look for you.
AIDAN	"I think we both look kinda sharp tonight. You've never looked prettier, my friend."
CARRIE	Thank you.
AIDAN	"Let's get married tonight. Come on, you've got this beautiful white dress on, I've got this tux for another 13 hours. Let's just do it. Let's get in a cab, airport, Vegas. No muss, no fuss."
CARRIE	"Aidan, this isn't funny."
AIDAN	"Come on! Look, if we get married tonight, we wake up tomorrow, it's done. All right? We're still us."
AIDAN	We don't even have to tell anybody.
CARRIE	What about What we discussed?
AIDAN	Come on. You're just scared.
CARRIE	"Yes, I'm scared. Come on, Aidan, we talked about this."
AIDAN	"No, you talked and I listened. Carrie, I looked at you tonight from across the room and I thought, I love her. And she loves me. And what are we waiting for?"
CARRIE	Because I need more time.
AIDAN	What's going to change? This is me. I don't have any tricks up my sleeve. This is who I am.
CARRIE	This isn't about you. I'm not ready for marriage.
AIDAN	"I am. I'm sorry if that scares you, but I am. People fall in love, they get married. That's what they do."
CARRIE	"Not necessarily. Why can't we just keep things the way they are, just live together?"
AIDAN	I don't want to live together. I've had girlfriends for 20 years. I want you to be my wife.
CARRIE	"Aidan, you're pushing me."
AIDAN	Maybe you need to be pushed. What's the big deal? It's just a stupid piece of paper.
CARRIE	"If it's just a stupid piece of paper, then why do we need it?"
AIDAN	Because I need it! I want to make this official and lock this thing down. I want the whole wide world to know that you're mine.
CARRIE	Who else's would I be? Oh My God. You still don't trust me.
AIDAN	You don't even wear that ring on your finger.
CARRIE	I am yours. There is nobody else. I love you. But I can't marry you to make you trust me. Look at me. Look at me before we make a huge mistake.
AIDAN	"If you don't want to marry me right now, you'll never want to marry me."
CARRIE	That's not true.
AIDAN	I think it is. I'm gonna sleep in the other apartment tonight.
CARRIE	Really?
AIDAN	"Yeah, Really."
CARRIE	Just for tonight?
AIDAN	I can't believe I'm back here again.
CARRIE	shit.
CARRIE	"We had left the land of black and white, and now, everything was gray."
CARRIE	"To the outside world, Miranda's maternal gene might never kick in. But that night she felt a real kick from deep inside."
CARRIE	"There are some walls you can push through and some you can't. That was the only night we would ever spend on the other side of the wall. The next day, Aidan moved out."
CARRIE	"A girl in pigtails once said, ''There's no place like home. '' But then her home didn't have a toilet that flushed for no reason...and a boyfriend who was moving out for one big reason."
AIDAN	That's the last of it.
CARRIE	Okay.
AIDAN	You want me to fix that?
CARRIE	"No, it's okay. I can get someone to come and fix it."
AIDAN	Just let me get in there for a second. Hold the Ball Cock. This thing right here. Right there. That should do it. I should go.
CARRIE	You can't leave. Our last words to each other can't be ''Ball Cock.'' You should definitely stay...at least for another day. Or forever.
AIDAN	We've been through this. I can't.
CARRIE	are You sure?
AIDAN	I am.
CARRIE	Aidan... this is difficult to say. I left the ring on the clown table.
AIDAN	That's yours.
CARRIE	"No, I should never have accepted it in the first place. I'm sorry. Please take the ring."
AIDAN	I want you to have it.
CARRIE	Please take it. if You do Or say... one more Nice thing...
AIDAN	I got to go.
CARRIE	"I can't watch you leave, so I think I am gonna... I'm better... I'm gonna stand here. Could you just... could you just shut the door?"
AIDAN	Carrie.
CARRIE	"I know. Go. Three hours later, I peeled myself off the bathroom floor. Apparently, there were things that were difficult for Aidan to say, as well. I curled up to read Aidan's last words to me, also known as the goodbye letter."
SAMANTHA	Aidan's evicting her?
IRANDA	He's not evicting her. He's giving her 30 days to decide what she wants to do.
SAMANTHA	That's just tacky.
IRANDA	"Look, life gets complicated. Steve and I are drawing up papers to time-share our kid."
CARRIE	"Great love stories are supposed to end with tragedy and tears, not papers from the law firm of Gold and Vogel."
IRANDA	"This is more than fair. He's asking you to buy your apartment for the exact price he paid, or you can vacate and he'll sell it."
CARRIE	"Vacate? I'm homeless. I'll be a bag lady, a Fendi bag lady, but a bag lady."
CHARLOTTE	You should think of buying your place.
CARRIE	I am not a buyer. New York is a town Of renters. Everybody rents.
SAMANTHA	I don't.
IRANDA	I don't.
CHARLOTTE	I don't.
CARRIE	You got yours in the settlement. You did not have to pay for it.
CHARLOTTE	I paid for That apartment.
IRANDA	I'm pregnant. I can't control it.
SAMANTHA	"Honey, you better learn, because that is unappetizing."
IRANDA	I know. I am so swollen and gassy. I am like a flotation device.
SAMANTHA	"I'll get this one, and I don't want a fight out of you. Save it for your down payment."
CARRIE	
SAMANTHA	"No, Richard gave it to me as a gift."
IRANDA	nice. What was the occasion?
SAMANTHA	No occasion.
CHARLOTTE	he is in love with you.
SAMANTHA	he is not in love with me.
CARRIE	You don't know that.
SAMANTHA	I do. take a look at the card.
IRANDA	"''Style for style. Best, Richard.''"
CARRIE	''Best.'' Yikes.
IRANDA	''Best'' is the worst.
CARRIE	Even Gold and Vogel give you ''sincerely.''
SAMANTHA	'Best'' is like signing ''Not love.''
CHARLOTTE	It's the thought that counts. He bought you something he knew you'd love.
SAMANTHA	He's a pretty generous guy with money.
CARRIE	Aidan wanted me to Keep the ring.
CHARLOTTE	"You did, didn't you?"
SAMANTHA	"Honey, you're a fool."
CARRIE	No. It was the right thing to do. Do you ever think about giving yours back?
CHARLOTTE	"No, I love That ring."
CARRIE	"I couldn't keep it. Every time I looked at it, it would break my heart."
RUBY ROSEN	this ring is worth a lot.
CHARLOTTE	"Tiffany. 2.17 carats, platinum setting."
RUBY ROSEN	"Beautiful cut, very few inclusions. So, what do you want to do with it?"
CHARLOTTE	I was thinking maybe I'd turn it into a necklace.
RUBY ROSEN	a floating diamond necklace Would be to die. very now.
CHARLOTTE	"So, a lot Of people do this."
RUBY ROSEN	"These were my baguettes. Because it turned out by husband was a faggot, now they're earrings. But he had good taste. So, a necklace?"
CHARLOTTE	I'm not sure.
RUBY ROSEN	Maybe a pendant. We can melt down the platinum setting and turn it into spectacular earrings.
CHARLOTTE	Melt it down?
CARRIE	"There, in the wedding band boneyard, Charlotte started to melt down."
CHARLOTTE	I don't think I'm ready for this.
RUBY ROSEN	Just don't take it to the gypsies next door.
LINDA	Okay. Let's look at your assets here at the bank. You may be able to use them as collateral for the loan.
INTERCOM	"Linda, Line 1."
LINDA	It says here that you have $700 in your checking account.
CARRIE	I Just paid my credit card bill.
LINDA	And $957 in savings.
CARRIE	"Look, Linda. You're single, right? I'm sure you can appreciate my problem. I just broke up with my fiancÃ© which, trust me, is traumatic enough."
INTERCOM	"Linda, Line 2."
CARRIE	And now I have 25 days to either find the money to buy my place or I am out on the street.
LINDA	"Do you have any other income, besides the column?"
CARRIE	No. But I was chosen as New York magazine's best pick for city columnist. I was the pick over Pete Hamill.
LINDA	"What about your assets outside the bank? property, stocks, bonds?"
CARRIE	no. no. no.
LINDA	"I'm sorry, Ms. Bradshaw, but you are not a desirable candidate for a loan."
CARRIE	"After assessing what little assets I had, I realized I would have to change my lifestyle."
CARRIE	"Excuse me, Could You Tell me how much the bus is?"
BUS WAITER	$1.50.
CARRIE	"Really? Wow. Last time I took the bus, it was like 75 cents. You know, for $3 more, you could take a cab. For crying out loud."
BUS WAITER	Why do you have to take the bus if you're on the bus?
CARRIE	"My thoughts exactly. So here I was, a 35 year old single woman with no financial security but many life experiences behind me. Did that mean nothing? After All, heartbreak and breakups are the hardest kind of work. So shouldn't there be some sort of credit for enduring them? And if not, how do you retain a sense of value when you have nothing concrete to show for it? Because at the end of yet another failed relationship, when all you have are war wounds and self doubt, you have to wonder, what's it all worth?"
CHARLOTTE	"Let me just say again, I love your gallery, so if there are ever any openings, you have my resume."
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, a woman with far fewer financial worries was also contemplating her worth. Charlotte knew the ring didn't mean as much, now that she wasn't with Trey. But on that particularity low Thursday, she put on her 2.17carat diamond and wandered around her 2.17carat Park Avenue apartment."
CARRIE	"That night, at Richard's..."
SAMANTHA	another gift. are You trying to spoil me?
RICHARD	That's the plan.
SAMANTHA	"La Petite Coquette, my favorite."
RICHARD	I know. I pay attention. Wait a minute. There's a card.
SAMANTHA	"Oh, the card. ''Sexy for sexy. Best, Richard.''"
RICHARD	"Why don't you slip into that, while I pour us some Crystal?"
SAMANTHA	I'll do my very best.
CARRIE	"Water, water everywhere, and not a drop to drink. This is torture. Why are you doing this to me? I can't buy shoes."
IRANDA	I have to buy shoes. None of my old ones fit. Even my feet are fat.
CARRIE	these are pretty.
IRANDA	I'm looking for comfortable.
CARRIE	"Then I'll try these for you. Excuse me, sir, could I try these please, in a 7.5? And these. I guess, just all of these. But, sir, no matter what happens in the next 20 minutes, under no circumstances am I to buy these. I'm just trying them on for fun."
SALESMAN	How fun for me.
IRANDA	Could I try these in a nine?
SALESMAN	Sure.
IRANDA	Thanks.
CARRIE	What is that smell? -
IRANDA	"Sorry. I've learned to control the sound now, but not the activity."
CARRIE	That's just mean. Damn! How'll people know to scatter without a warning?
IRANDA	"Although, maybe it's not that I control the noise as much as my ass is so big the sound is now muffled. Look at my fingers. They're like sausages. I can't even get my ring off. I'm telling you, the fat ass, the farting, it's ridiculous. I am unfuckable and I have never been so horny in my entire life."
CARRIE	Really?
IRANDA	"Yeah. That's why you should be married while pregnant, so somebody is obligated to have sex with you. I'm an undesirable."
CARRIE	No. I am. The lady at the bank said I was an unattractive candidate for a loan. Where did all my money go? I know I've made some.
IRANDA	"At $400 a pop, how many of these do you have? Fifty?"
CARRIE	come on.
IRANDA	a hundred?
CARRIE	Would That be wrong?
IRANDA	"100 times 400, there's your down payment."
CARRIE	"That's only $4,000. -"
IRANDA	"No, it's $40,000."
CARRIE	"I spent $40,000 on shoes and I have no place to live? I will literally be the old woman who lived in her shoes."
IRANDA	I pulled my own finger. I'm a walking whoopie cushion.
CARRIE	"When a girl gets backed up against a wall she can't afford, she has to consider renting others."
CARRIE	That's the closet? Where do the shoes go?
DELIA THE BROKER	You get one of those racks that hang on the door.
CARRIE	I'll hang myself on a door if I have to live here. Do I smell curry?
DELIA THE BROKER	There's an Indian restaurant downstairs.
CARRIE	"Delia, I ask you, how can this apartment be $2,800 a month? I pay $750 for something that's twice the size. It don't smell like takeout."
DELIA THE BROKER	You have a rent-controlled apartment. I suggest you stay there.
CARRIE	"Unfortunately, that's really not an option. What other shit holes are you showing me today?"
DELIA THE BROKER	"I have to be honest. With your attitude and price limitations, I think you should consider Weehawken."
BIG	"Get back to me when the numbers are in. Look at you, all dressed up. Applying for a job here?"
CARRIE	"So this is where you work. It's cute. It's smaller than I expected. I always imagined rows and rows of blondes in tight sweaters, typing."
BIG	They're at lunch.
CARRIE	I am here in an official capacity. Aren't you going to ask me to sit down?
BIG	By all means. Pick a chair.
CARRIE	"Faced with the prospect of Weehawken, I decided it was time to call in the big guns."
BIG	"Now, what can I do for you?"
CARRIE	I once read that you took something like $3 million and leveraged it to build a $100 million building. How did you do that?
BIG	What's going on?
CARRIE	I want to buy my apartment but I have no money. I'm worth nothing.
BIG	"You're worth a million bucks, Bradshaw."
CARRIE	Maybe you should go work at a bank. Aidan and I broke up.
BIG	So it's not just money troubles. Why didn't you call me?
CARRIE	I got enough troubles.
BIG	What happened?
CARRIE	"Apparently, you were right, I am not the marrying kind."
BIG	"Or the timing wasn't right. You're going to be ok, kid."
CARRIE	So I need money. You know money. I need to know what you know about money.
BIG	Simple. I'll tell you how to get the money.
CARRIE	Big offered me the money for my down payment. But I could never take it. Could I?
IRANDA	"No, you couldn't."
CHARLOTTE	"He just gave you $30,000?"
CARRIE	as a loan. I Would pay Him back.
SAMANTHA	take the money.
IRANDA	"When a man gives you money, you give him control."
SAMANTHA	"It's just money. Man, woman, who cares? It's fluid. Someone needs it, you give it. You need it, you take it."
CHARLOTTE	I'm uncomfortable with this conversation. We shouldn't be talking about money.
IRANDA	Why not? We talk about everything else.
SAMANTHA	"People are funny about money. Like Richard, he's happy to buy me gifts, but..."
CARRIE	Still no ''love''?
SAMANTHA	"No, But he continues to send his best."
IRANDA	Don't cash Big's check. I'll loan you the money.
CARRIE	"You're about to have a baby. I can't take your money. And furthermore, do you have that much?"
IRANDA	I have about half that.
CARRIE	what? Does No one else shoe shop?
SAMANTHA	I Could loan You the rest.
CARRIE	Look...that is really...sweet of you two to offer. It's really sweet. But I'm gonna do this on my own.
CARRIE	So I can't tape it back.
CHARLOTTE	I have news. Looks like I have gotten a job as a docent at the Museum of Modern Art.
CARRIE	What Does That pay? I can docent.
CHARLOTTE	"It's a volunteer job, but they're very coveted positions."
CARRIE	I have no fortune. I didn't need a cookie to tell me that.
CARRIE	These fans only cost $1. I'm going to save a lot of money on air conditioning.
IRANDA	You okay?
CARRIE	No apartment and no Aidan. It's been a rough two weeks. Just give me a block. I'm going to be fine.
CARRIE	"As I thought about leaving the apartment that I had lived in for the past decade, I realized how much I would miss it. Through everything, it had always been there for me. And suddenly, I was irrationality angry, and I knew just where and who to take it irrationality out on."
CHARLOTTE	Hi. What are You doing here?
CARRIE	I was Just in the neighborhood.
CHARLOTTE	come on in. You want some iced tea Or something?
CARRIE	Why didn't you offer me the money?
CHARLOTTE	I knew You were going to say that.
CARRIE	I wouldn't take it.
CHARLOTTE	Then what does it matter if I offer it or not?
CARRIE	Because I would have offered it to you. You're my friend.
CHARLOTTE	Money and friendship don't mix. My father and his friend Paul were never the same...
CARRIE	"We're not talking about your father and his friend Paul. We're talking about you and your friend, me. And for the record, I am aware that I have some financial messiness hat I have to clean up, and to that end, I am looking into some freelance magazine work. I have been offered $4 a word at Vogue. That is a lot. Most people get $2. So, yes, I have made some mistakes, and, Charlotte, you have made some mistakes. When you were making those mistakes, I was sitting across from you at the coffee shop, nodding and listening and supporting you. I was not sitting at a Chinese restaurant, turning away when you should have been looking at me. And what kills me is, you don't even have to work. You're volunteering."
CHARLOTTE	I love you. But it's not my job to fix your finances. You're a 35 year old woman. You need to learn to stand on your own.
CARRIE	What is That on your finger?
CHARLOTTE	I just wear it when I'm alone in my house.
CARRIE	And you're telling me to be more independent?
CHARLOTTE	"It's my ring. I can wear it if I want to. And so what if it makes me feel better? And for the record, the only reason I'm volunteering is, no one will hire me. I've called seven galleries. Apparently, I have too much experience."
CARRIE	"You're right. It's your ring, it's your business. I got all worked up on the walk over here."
CHARLOTTE	You walked?
CARRIE	"No, I took a $5 cab ride, seven blocks. These shoes pinch my feet, but I love them. I am in a financial cul-de-sac. But I'm going to take the bus. I just hope I'm not on it."
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, in the lap of luxury..."
ROGER	"It's okay. I'm Richard's assistant, and I'm gay."
SAMANTHA	Okay. turn around and Give a girl a moment.
ROGER	"I'm Roger, and you weren't supposed to be here."
SAMANTHA	"Richard left, and I decided to take a nice relaxing bath, but now that's shot to shit. Okay. Decent."
ROGER	"I am so sorry, but if it's any consolation, wow!"
SAMANTHA	"Pilates. So, why haven't I seen you around the office?"
ROGER	He has three assistants. I run his errands.
SAMANTHA	His errands! Is that an errand gift wrapped on the bed?
ROGER	All right. I'm his personal shopper. He's a very busy man.
SAMANTHA	I'll bet. Exactly how many women are you buying gifts for?
ROGER	What do You mean?
SAMANTHA	You've seen my bush. We're a little past acting coy.
ROGER	"Since you came into the picture, a lot less. And he's never sent me to Chanel before. That was fun. Great wallet. It also came in red, but I couldn't decide..."
SAMANTHA	"So, Richard didn't pick out any of these gifts?"
ROGER	"Technically, no. But he really likes you. I can tell."
SAMANTHA	"Yeah, he thinks I'm the best. Wait, the cards. ''Style for style''? ''Sexy for sexy''?"
ROGER	"''Me for you.'' Please, don't have me fired."
SAMANTHA	I'll tell you what. I'll pretend you don't exist.
ROGER	Thank you. -
SAMANTHA	"If you do one thing for me. Oh, Richard."
RICHARD	I thought you'd like it.
SAMANTHA	"You did? I forgot the card. ''Gorgeous for gorgeous. Love, Richard.''"
RICHARD	"I love You, Samantha. I do."
SAMANTHA	You do? and I love... this.
CARRIE	"Samantha could have said, ''I love you. '' But she was afraid it would cost her too much. So she did what she did best."
IRANDA	"So every other Saturday and Wednesday at 5:00 p.m, you take him."
STEVE	I was thinking 3:56 p.m. Would be better.
IRANDA	You think this is stupid.
STEVE	"No, I just was thinking that things are gonna to get off schedule. I mean, we're talking about a kid, not a train. I'd offer to do that for you, but I don't think it's in the contract."
IRANDA	"Don't give me a hard time. I could fart you into oblivion right now. That feels so great. Thanks. Steve, am I ugly?"
STEVE	what? no. You got That glow.
IRANDA	But Would You want to have sex with me?
STEVE	What are you talking about? You're pregnant.
IRANDA	"Yeah, and another charming side effect, aside from flatulence and bloating, is all I can think about is sex. And who would want to have sex with me?"
STEVE	"I'd like to have sex with you, but I'm pretty sure it's not allowed. I've read section B14 in the contract and it said nothing about sex."
IRANDA	Fuck the contract and Please Fuck me.
STEVE	Ouch.
IRANDA	What?
STEVE	You're squishing me.
IRANDA	I'm sorry.
STEVE	no.
CARRIE	"That night, Steve gave Miranda multiple orgasms for what it's worth."
IRANDA	"Just to be clear, this doesn't mean we're a couple. This is a mercy fuck."
CARRIE	I'm sorry about the other day. I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.
CHARLOTTE	You were right. I didn't want to let go of being Mrs. Trey MacDougal.
CARRIE	I think you are coping amazingly well. I'm just scared.
CHARLOTTE	"I know. me, too."
CARRIE	Wow! We're alone again.
CHARLOTTE	Yeah. I want You to take the ring for your down payment.
CARRIE	"No, I can't. You love this ring."
CHARLOTTE	"No, I love What the ring represented."
CARRIE	"No, you're right. It would make things too complicated."
CHARLOTTE	This is a straightforward business proposal. Clean and simple. Why do I have all this money if I can't help out a friend?
CARRIE	But it would be a loan. I'll pay you back.
CHARLOTTE	I know.
CARRIE	I want You to think really carefully about this.
CHARLOTTE	I have.
CARRIE	will You be comfortable knowing That It will take me time to pay You back?
CHARLOTTE	I will.
CARRIE	"I really appreciate this. I'll pay you back. You know that, right?"
CHARLOTTE	I do. It's oK. I trust you. will You take the ring?
CARRIE	I will. Thank you.
CARRIE	"Charlotte had taken her painful past and turned it into my hopeful future, and that made the ring priceless."
CHARLOTTE	I start work at the museum next week.
CARRIE	That's great. Guess what. I got Vogue up to $4.50 a word.
REPAIRMAN	"I fixed the toilet, and should be done with this by the end of the afternoon."
CARRIE	"Okay, great. Thank you."
CARRIE	"It wasn't quite as easy as clicking my Manolo Blahniks three times, but it was worth it. I was home."
CARRIE	"Every morning, millions of New Yorkers leave their crowded apartments and head out to the even more crowded streets, on their way to work. Today, I was one of them. Sometimes, a girl just needs a new start. I had a new do, a new mortgage, and, therefore, a new job. I had just submitted my first freelance article for one of the most relevant and provocative magazines on the newsstands today, at least to me. Vogue. Also known as Mecca, where I belonged."
ENID	This isn't Vogue.
CARRIE	You didn't like it?
JULIAN FISHER	No one is saying that.
ENID	"I am. I didn't like it. There, I said it."
JULIAN FISHER	"What Enid is trying to say, Carrie, is That You wrote a wonderful first draft."
ENID	That isn't Vogue.
CARRIE	"There it was, the article I'd put my heart and soul into and it was bleeding."
JULIAN FISHER	Your spin on the idea is very clever. Different types of men as the new accessories for fall. A Prada... ''A Prada dress should always be worn with an investment banker.'' That's wonderful.
ENID	"Julian, the assignment was 500 words on accessories, not men. And I'm not convinced she knows anything about purses. Or, for that matter, men."
JULIAN FISHER	"Enid, for the love of God..."
ENID	"Ms. Bradshaw, what you've handed us here is essentially your newspaper column with the word ''style'' jammed in where the word ''sex'' used to be. We're not looking for Vogue according to your agenda. No one cares about your agenda."
JULIAN FISHER	That's not true.
ENID	"Forgive me. I don't care about your agenda. I care about designers. Oscar de la Renta, Chanel, Dior. I want less Carrie Bradshaw and more... ''Carry this bag with these shoes.'' Do you see what I mean? You're a writer. You should be writing this down."
CARRIE	"I was trying to find a way to introduce the bags and the bracelets with a little humor. Kind of, ''Men are the new black.'' It was supposed to be funny."
ENID	It was supposed to be bags.
CARRIE	I didn't really bring a writing implement. Okay. Bags.
CARRIE	"An hour later, Enid had to leave for a lunch date, presumably to devour another writer."
JULIAN FISHER	"Don't let Enid get to you. She just came back from Paris and apparently humor and irony are out this season. Billie Holiday, the only woman I can think of in more pain than you right now. Come on, cookie, chin up, in publishing you need two things, a tough hide and a dry martini."
CARRIE	"Martinis in the morning, is this allowed? Is it Vogue?"
JULIAN FISHER	Only in absolute emergencies. Last time I broke this out was when I heard that fun fur was making a comeback.
CARRIE	Look at this mess. Why was I even hired?
JULIAN FISHER	I'm afraid you've got me to blame for that. My daughter introduced me to your column about a year ago. I thought you'd be a natural at Vogue.
CARRIE	I guess you thought wrong.
JULIAN FISHER	"Haven't been wrong yet. Vogue is all about vision. And you cookie have got vision. We just have to find a way to hide your vision from Enid's vision. A little less you, a little more purse. Come on. Drink."
CARRIE	
CARRIE	"and the sad thing is, this is What I do best. I mean, look at it."
JULIAN FISHER	"Cookie, you're drunk."
CARRIE	Yeah. Cookie's drunk. I'm drunk at Vogue.
JULIAN FISHER	How can anyone get so drunk on one and a half martinis?
CARRIE	"I didn't eat breakfast and I'm a size two, which should make me perfect for Vogue, but nope, I'm drunk and a failure at Vogue."
JULIAN FISHER	I feel awful. This is my fault.
CARRIE	"Julian, I came in here today so cocky. I thought I knew it All. I had my men jokes and my purse puns. You heard her. What do I know about purses? Nothing. What do I know about men? Oops! I spilled. I spilled at Vogue."
JULIAN FISHER	Okay. Maybe we better Just take You home.
CARRIE	I can't go out there. I'm drunk. I'm drunk at Vogue.
JULIAN FISHER	"Left, right. Now look at me. Pretend I'm saying something fantastic about corsets."
WOMAN	Excuse me.
CARRIE	Please tell me that wasn't Anna Win tour.
JULIAN FISHER	"It wasn't. Now just... Left, right."
CARRIE	"Right. So sorry. That night, at a more appropriate Cocktail hour,.."
SAMANTHA	"Come on, there must be something you want for your birthday."
RICHARD	What I want for my birthday is not to celebrate it this year.
SAMANTHA	What if I want to celebrate it?
RICHARD	That would be celebration enough. Besides I have everything I need.
SAMANTHA	"It's not about needing something. It's about wanting something just for fun. Something decadent, something naughty."
ALEXA	"May I tempt you with dessert? How was everything this evening, Mr. Wright.?"
RICHARD	"Delicious, Thank you."
ALEXA	"Alexa. I took the liberty of preordering our Chocolate soufflÃ© for you and Ms. Jones, if you want something sweet."
RICHARD	Always. Thank you for keeping an eye on us.
ALEXA	I couldn't help it. You're the most attractive couple in the restaurant.
RICHARD	I know what I'd like for my birthday. An all-night nonstop championship fuck fest with you...
SAMANTHA	Then consider your candles blown.
RICHARD	...and Alexa. You asked.
SAMANTHA	Is a three-way with a 21 year old a bad idea for Richard's birthday?
CARRIE	What are you gonna get him next year? A four way?
SAMANTHA	He doesn't wanna be monogamous. He'll cheat with or without me.
CARRIE	Happy birthday to you.
SAMANTHA	He didn't ask me to get him a hooker.
CHARLOTTE	these are the options?
SAMANTHA	"It's someone we know and at least this way, I'm part of the fantasy."
CHARLOTTE	The fantasy being that he's attracted to someone young enough to be his daughter.
SAMANTHA	"He is, Charlotte, that's the problem! Richard's in his fucking prime. Men look better as they get older and women get..."
CARRIE	"Three ways, apparently, or a Marc Jacobs ultramod little notebook. Evidently, I'm recommending it to Vogue shoppers."
CHARLOTTE	"Just be careful. Samantha. When a man has a fantasy and you fulfill it, there always is the chance that the relationship could blow up. Then you're the idiot who did it with him on the golf course, or something."
CARRIE	was It You and Trey?
CHARLOTTE	"No, it's a ''for instance.''"
IRANDA	"Sorry I'm late. I was shopping for a stroller. I shouldn't even be here. I should be out doing all the things I'm supposed to before the baby comes, and I'm unable to leave my apartment ever again."
CARRIE	Like what? Jujitsu and off-track betting?
IRANDA	"Like buying a crib. Evidently, I'm to go to Crib World, because it's a whole world of cribs. I guess Crib City wasn't big enough. Why isn't there a store called ''This is The Crib For You''? And they just have one great crib. They deliver it and assemble it, and help raise the child."
CHARLOTTE	You don't have a crib yet?
IRANDA	"No, I have a job instead. I'm sorry, but when am I supposed to find time to prepare for this baby?"
IRANDA	I don't have a vague idea how I'm going to do any of it.
CARRIE	"I don't have a Vogue idea, so hello."
SAMANTHA	Why don't you let One Ball help you?
IRANDA	"Yeah. I tried that. He starts acting all father figure, and I get territorial, and the salespeople get confused. Trust me, it's too complicated for Crib World."
CHARLOTTE	"Let me help you. You said you didn't want a baby shower, but you can change your mind."
IRANDA	I hate baby showers.
SAMANTHA	Who doesn't?
IRANDA	"The games, the finger sandwiches, all that enforced oohing and ahing."
CARRIE	"I don't ooh and aah, and I don't care who's having a baby."
CHARLOTTE	Think of the gifts. It'd be a great way to get all the stuff you need.
CARRIE	Without going to Crib World.
IRANDA	who Would I invite besides You guys?
SAMANTHA	All the bitches That made You Go to theirs.
CHARLOTTE	It's your shower. You can invite or not invite whoever you choose.
IRANDA	Would you really want to throw me a baby shower after all you've been through this year?
CHARLOTTE	"Yeah, I think it would be good for me."
IRANDA	"Okay, but no cutesy, storky shit. Just an adult, dignified lunch with presents which I will open after everyone leaves."
CHARLOTTE	You have to open the presents.
IRANDA	"No opening of presents, no games, no crust less bread. And I want fried chicken."
CHARLOTTE	Fried chicken! But it's not Super Bowl Sunday.
IRANDA	"It's my shower, and I'll fry if I want to."
SAMANTHA	What should we do for our gift?
CARRIE	Let's just stick to the registry three-way.
CARRIE	"The next day, Charlotte decided if she was going to host a baby shower, she should hide the evidence that she had wanted one of her own."
CARRIE	"Later that week, I had a meal with the perfect dinner accessory, Julian."
JULIAN FISHER	"My wife is a former dancer. She was with the Martha Graham Company. And the first time I saw her on stage, I fell in love with her. She plied and I plotzed. It'll be 24 years next September."
CARRIE	So you got married right out of grade school.
JULIAN FISHER	I knew there was something about you that I liked. What about your life? Is there a man in your life? Is it a great love?
CARRIE	"I just broke up with somebody. And yes, it was a great love. But he went there. I went there."
JULIAN FISHER	And there you have it.
CARRIE	"So, Julian the reason that I asked you to dinner tonight..."
JULIAN FISHER	was because You knew I Would pay?
CARRIE	"Besides that. I wanted to tell you that I really appreciate your interest in my article, but I've decided not to finish it."
JULIAN FISHER	"So what are you gonna do, you're just going to quit? No, I don't let my kids quit."
CARRIE	"Technically, I'm not one of your kids. I'm just a girl you get drunk sometimes."
JULIAN FISHER	"All right, forget about me. What would your father say about you quitting?"
CARRIE	My father wouldn't have a whole lot to say about quitting. He quit my mother and me when I was little.
JULIAN FISHER	Sorry.
CARRIE	Thanks. I mean a long time ago. I was 5.
JULIAN FISHER	Why did he leave?
CARRIE	"No idea, never said. And that's the name of that tune. What?"
JULIAN FISHER	"No, it's interesting. Your father leaves without any answers and you spend your life asking questions about men. It's 20 years of analysis. Forgive me?"
CARRIE	Yes.
JULIAN FISHER	"Okay, Vogue. What if I could fix it so that you only deal with me, and Enid spends less time hating your writing and more time hating Tom Ford's line?"
CARRIE	Julian.
JULIAN FISHER	"Come on, cookie, you're no quitter. And we get to work on this together. What do you say?"
CARRIE	Why are You Being So sweet?
JULIAN FISHER	martini guilt.
CARRIE	"Later that night, I got to thinking about fathers, or the lack of them. Some say a daughter's relationship with her father is the model for all her subsequent relationships with men. Is that just pop psychology, or is there some truth to it? And if you were given a less-than-perfect model, does it mean a life of less-than-perfect relationships? I couldn't help but wonder, how much does a father figure figure?"
IRANDA	"Gentlemen, I understand your concern, but I'm looking at the contract right now. I'm sorry, could you hold for a moment? I'm on a conference call here."
WOMAN ON PHONE	Charlotte York says it's an emergency.
IRANDA	"Charlotte. What's wrong, you okay?"
CHARLOTTE	I'm fine. I'm just looking at your registry. There are some things you forgot to include. Like a Manhattan Whoozit.
IRANDA	A what?
CHARLOTTE	It's a learning toy. Active toys make for passive children. There's a philosophy on it.
IRANDA	I don't have the time for philosophy. I'm on a conference call with our London office.
CHARLOTTE	What about a Peek ball?
IRANDA	"Jesus, I have to get back."
CHARLOTTE	"One more quick thing. I know you said no storks, but I saw the most gorgeous centerpiece in the shape of a stork"
IRANDA	I'm at work.
CHARLOTTE	we have to order It by noon. Its feathers are white Fiji mum.
IRANDA	What did I say?
CHARLOTTE	"No storks. But these people are giving expensive gifts, and they'll want to see a little baby."
IRANDA	"No storks, no present opening, no cutesy baby stuff. We agreed."
CHARLOTTE	What about a marzipan baby carriage?
IRANDA	Charlotte!
CHARLOTTE	"It has a white chocolate peanut butter baby inside, and you can eat the baby. Miranda? Miranda?"
CARRIE	"The next day, Samantha made a conference call of her own."
ALEXA	"Ms. Jones, welcome. Will Mr. Wright be joining you for lunch?"
SAMANTHA	"No, Actually, it's Richard's birthday this weekend and I'm trying to put together a little celebration for him."
ALEXA	Certainly. Would you like to reserve one of our banquet rooms or...
SAMANTHA	"That won't be necessary. It's a very small party. A very small private party of three. Just Richard, myself, and a third, if you have any openings."
ALEXA	I'm wide open.
SAMANTHA	lucky me.
CARRIE	"And now that Charlotte's house was ready for the baby shower, she wanted to make sure Miranda's house was ready for the baby."
CHARLOTTE	"The bassinet can go over here by the bed. So that when you get up for feedings, he's right there. See? Unless you're planning to have him sleep in bed with you."
IRANDA	Can't I go to jail for that?
CHARLOTTE	"No. In fact many cultures believe it's safer for the baby's breathing. Although you do run the risk of rolling over and smashing him while asleep. But that almost never happens. But almost it never, so if you want to err on the side of safety..."
IRANDA	I'll just put him in the thing.
CHARLOTTE	"The bassinet? Great. And then when he's big enough, you can put the crib here. Is that what you were thinking?"
IRANDA	I hadn't thought about that yet.
CHARLOTTE	"You need to start thinking about these things, â€˜cause there are a million questions to answer before the baby ever gets here. Do you have a birthing plan? Do you know what kind of mother you want to be?"
IRANDA	Yes. I plan to be a good mother.
CHARLOTTE	"But a marsupial mom or a stroller mom? Will you be breastfeeding or bottle-feeding? And what about baby proofing? 'Cause with all the sharp edges around here, I mean, this place is a deathtrap!"
IRANDA	"Okay, You need to back off."
CHARLOTTE	I'm just trying to help.
IRANDA	This is your idea of helping? Pointing out all the things I do badly?
CHARLOTTE	I'm not pointing out...
IRANDA	"Yes, You are."
CHARLOTTE	"You need to try to let other people in a little, because once you have that baby, it's not just you anymore. You're not gonna be able to control everything."
IRANDA	"Look, I just want to enjoy the fried chicken and be done with it."
CHARLOTTE	I had to rethink the fried chicken because you're the only one who wanted all that breading. So instead we're having mesclun greens and a lovely puttanesca with a Fiji mum center-piece.
IRANDA	A Fiji mum stork centerpiece?
CHARLOTTE	One stork. I think you can deal with one.
IRANDA	Two storks. I saw the invitation! There's a stork on the invitation.
CHARLOTTE	That's not a stork! That is a duck. That duck is smoking an ''it's a boy'' cigar. That's not enough for children.
IRANDA	That duck is fucked! This whole shower is fucked!
CHARLOTTE	You can't have a shower without baby stuff!
IRANDA	"You keep this stuff, and you'll have a shower without a mommy!"
CHARLOTTE	Fine!
IRANDA	Fine!
CHARLOTTE	"Miranda, you better show up. I am not getting stuck with a bunch of lawyers, who, if they're anything like you, won't even appreciate a beautiful puttanesca!"
IRANDA	Watch out for the sharp edges!
IRANDA	Thanks for coming down and talking.
CARRIE	"I really didn't have a choice. You couldn't make it up the stairs. There, you feel better?"
IRANDA	"The back, yes. The other stuff, no. I'm gonna be a terrible mother."
CARRIE	Miranda.
IRANDA	"I am! I have no maternal instincts, no patience. The way I yelled at Charlotte. She was just trying to point out what needed to be child-proofed. Oh, my God."
CARRIE	what?
IRANDA	I'm what needs to be child-proofed.
CARRIE	"You wanna quit? Come on, I'll quit the magazine. You quit the baby. We'll be two quitters. We'll live happily ever after."
IRANDA	can I Tell You a secret?
CARRIE	You're not really pregnant? It's water weight?
IRANDA	"I dropped my niece on her head. I was babysitting when I was 13, and I got bored. I got bored Carrie. I was doing my homework, she slid down the couch. Two stitches."
CARRIE	Get off my stoop!
IRANDA	"How is this kid ever gonna make it? A type A mother, who works 50 hours a week, and no father figure."
CARRIE	he has a father figure.
IRANDA	Steve.
CARRIE	I meant you.
IRANDA	Really?
CARRIE	Yeah.
IRANDA	I do like those Yankees!
CARRIE	"second date, dinner and a movie."
IRANDA	"Yeah, I hate them."
CARRIE	"Hey Do you think it really can be as simple as, ''My father walked out, therefore I'll always be messed up about men?''"
IRANDA	"My father came home every night at 7:00 on the dot, and I have no clue about men either."
CARRIE	So it's a crapshoot.
IRANDA	Do I have to go to my own baby shower? -
CARRIE	I R.S.V.P.'d to a duck with a cigar.
IRANDA	All Right.
CARRIE	You're going.
IRANDA	It's late. I've got to catch a cab.
CARRIE	"Wait, let me get you a forklift. When you're ready."
IRANDA	Okay.
CARRIE	go.
IRANDA	Thank you.
CARRIE	You did Good.
IRANDA	"You, too."
CARRIE	"The next day, Miranda decided not to duck her own shower."
CHARLOTTE	Hey You showed up.
IRANDA	"Bring on the ladies in hats, and let's get this over with. Where'd you put all the storks?"
CHARLOTTE	You said you didn't want any storks.
IRANDA	"I know, but... What did You do?"
CHARLOTTE	"It's your shower. Can you get that? â€˜Cause I have to get the sandwiches, which have all of their crusts. Nothing cute. No ridiculous, over-the-top baby stuff allowed."
SAMANTHA	"Hey, Momma!"
CARRIE	Why are you opening the door? Shouldn't you to be sitting on a lily pad being worshipped?
IRANDA	What is that?
CARRIE	It's a four tiered baby cake made entirely Of diapers.
SAMANTHA	I baked It myself.
CARRIE	we ordered It online
IRANDA	. What am I supposed to do with it?
SAMANTHA	How the hell should we know? Didn't you want one?
IRANDA	no.
CARRIE	We're not taking it back. We've already been seen carrying it down Park Avenue. Definitely not Vogue.
IRANDA	Charlotte said it was the shower gift.
CARRIE	I told you we should've gotten the massage certificate.
CARRIE	"One hour, two platters of chicken, and 13 lawyers later, all talk had turned to babies. Almost all."
SAMANTHA	"She may be 21, but I have 21 years of experience. I could fuck her under the table."
CARRIE	"That's good to know. Because in a three-way situation, it could come to that."
SAMANTHA	I have tricks she hasn't even seen.
CARRIE	Those Trix aren't for kids.
SAMANTHA	"And no matter whatever happens, she's just renting him. I own."
CARRIE	Exactly.
SAMANTHA	"Although, I don't really own."
CARRIE	So it's more of an illegal sublet type thing?
SAMANTHA	Yeah.
CARRIE	Wow!
GRETCHEN	"It's a breast pump. I didn't want you coming to my office to borrow mine. You know what? I have to pee. Wait. Here. You take Charles. Have fun, Mom."
IRANDA	"All right. Keep it coming, ladies. Let's keep the presents."
CARRIE	Miranda!
IRANDA	Yeah?
CARRIE	Nothing.
CHARLOTTE	Something tells me this one's Tiffany.
WENDY	That's from me.
IRANDA	That is elegant.
CHARLOTTE	"Oh, my God. That's exactly like the rattle Trey gave me when we first..."
IRANDA	You okay?
CHARLOTTE	"I'm fine. Sorry, everybody. Excuse me."
WENDY	What did I do?
IRANDA	Charlotte?
CHARLOTTE	I Just need to be alone Right now.
IRANDA	"Okay. Except, you know, you've got 20 people in the other room."
CHARLOTTE	I'm sorry I ruined your shower.
IRANDA	"You didn't. And there wouldn't even be a shower to ruin if it weren't for you. Look, I know this is hard. And I really appreciate you trying to be okay with me having this baby, because I need you. I mean, let's face it. You're the only person in my life who knows how important it is to have a cake made entirely out of diapers."
CHARLOTTE	"There's lotion in there, too."
IRANDA	"Oh, Yeah?"
CHARLOTTE	and baby bottles and a receiving blanket.
IRANDA	See? I Would never have known that.
CHARLOTTE	You will figure It out.
CARRIE	"And just like that, Miranda realized she might be a good mother figure, as well."
CARRIE	"Hello. Somebody better go check on Mommy in the guest bath, 'cause little bits here has wet himself, and myself, I might add."
IRANDA	I happen to have four tiers Of diapers.
CARRIE	Good.
SAMANTHA	"Ladies, can we cut the cake and get out of here? I have a three-way to go to."
IRANDA	this?
IRANDA	That's my earring.
CARRIE	"That night, at the birthday three-way, Samantha made sure it happened her way."
SAMANTHA	"Just so we're clear, tonight is just about sex, not love. So there will be no kissing on the mouth. Richard's lips are off-limits to anyone but me."
ALEXA	What if he kisses me?
RICHARD	Who's up for champagne?
ALEXA	I'm up for anything. Hey!
RICHARD	"Easy, Sam. There's more than enough of me to go around."
ALEXA	"You Tell her, Daddy."
CARRIE	The one thing Richard didn't want for his birthday was to feel older.
RICHARD	get rid Of her.
SAMANTHA	I'm on it.
CARRIE	It was time for the fledging to leave the love nest.
SAMANTHA	Anything else You want for your birthday?
RICHARD	"No, this is great. Just You and me."
SAMANTHA	What about my three-way? I have a busboy arriving at midnight.
RICHARD	"Seriously, let's try this. Just you and me, nobody else."
SAMANTHA	Oh. Okay.
CARRIE	"By giving Richard what he thought he wanted, Samantha finally got what she needed, monogamy."
CARRIE	"The Following night, with a little after-hours help from my favorite editor, I finished the impossible, my first Vogue piece."
CARRIE	"And now, my favorite part of the writing process...print."
JULIAN FISHER	"Congratulations, cookie. Five hundred beautifully written words, and some of them even include the Carrie Bradshaw agenda. Cleverly hidden, of course."
CARRIE	It's a literary Where's Waldo?
JULIAN FISHER	"When I finish a piece, I usually celebrate by opening a bottle of Chateau La Tour. How do you celebrate?"
CARRIE	By buying shoes and purses.
JULIAN FISHER	"In that case, have you ever heard of the Vogue accessories closet?"
CARRIE	"Oh, my God! It's too good! I'm sorry, but it's... it's too good!"
JULIAN FISHER	You're just like a kid in a couture candy store.
CARRIE	
JULIAN FISHER	"designers send these things, and we photograph them."
CARRIE	"Oh, my God!"
JULIAN FISHER	Shh Carrie.
CARRIE	Do you know what these are?
JULIAN FISHER	We're not even supposed to be in here.
CARRIE	Manolo Blahnik Mary Janes. I thought these were an urban shoe myth.
JULIAN FISHER	"Now if you'll excuse me, I'll be pillaging the men's side."
CARRIE	"Okay. Oh, my God! These are authentic patent leather. And if they don't fit, so help me, I'm gonna wear them anyway. Crap. They almost fit."
JULIAN FISHER	Tell me what you think of these Versaces.
CARRIE	Okay. all right!
JULIAN FISHER	What do You think?
CARRIE	"Oh, my... What are You doing?"
JULIAN FISHER	I'm just showing you these briefs.
CARRIE	"Well, don't. Julian, pull your pants up."
JULIAN FISHER	Look at you in those Mary Janes!
CARRIE	"Stop. What happened to your wife, the dancer?"
JULIAN FISHER	"She's having an affair with her friend, the chiropractor. Carrie."
CARRIE	what?
JULIAN FISHER	I find you adorable.
CARRIE	You're old enough to be my father.
JULIAN FISHER	Hardly. Would your father wear Versaces?
CARRIE	"Pull your pants up, now."
JULIAN FISHER	"All right. But, cookie, as someone who really cares about you, let me say, I think you have some serious issues with men."
CARRIE	I do right now.
JULIAN FISHER	"An older man can help you work through some of those father issues, cookie."
CARRIE	"Okay, don't ''cookie'' me, Freud. Pants up! Show some respect. This is Vogue!"
CARRIE	"It turns out Julian had an agenda, as well. But it was cleverly hidden, of course."
CARRIE	"From then on, once a month, when I went to Vogue, I thought it best to work exclusively with Enid."
ENID	"This new piece shows improvement, but still positively reeks of you. This magazine doesn't care what Carrie Bradshaw says about shoes. What does Carrie Bradshaw know about shoes?"
CARRIE	"Enid, With all due respect, men, I may not know, but shoes... shoes, I know."
ENID	I'm walking.
CARRIE	"I'm walking, too. I admit it's tempting to wish for the perfect boss or the perfect parent, or the perfect outfit. But maybe the best any of us can do is not quit. Play the hand we've been given, and accessorize the outfit we've got."
CARRIE	"There is a time of year in New York when, even before the first leaf falls you can feel the seasons click."
CARRIE	"The air is crisp, the summer is gone."
CARRIE	And for the first night in a long time you need a blanket on your bed.
CARRIE	It brings up other needs as well.
BIG	Hello?
CARRIE	What are You doing?
BIG	Is this who I think it is?
CARRIE	who do You think It is?
BIG	Princess Grace Of Monaco.
CARRIE	She's dead.
BIG	So you can understand my surprise.
BIG	"What's shaking, kid?"
CARRIE	It's fall.
BIG	I thought it was still Indian summer.
CARRIE	Uh-uh.
BIG	Then I guess I should take off my moccasins.
CARRIE	Are you still smoking?
BIG	Yes and no.
BIG	I'm bad.
CARRIE	Are you alone?
BIG	"Yes, ma'am."
CARRIE	I can't sleep.
CARRIE	I'm feeling a little lonely. Do you ever feel lonely?
BIG	No.
CARRIE	can I come over?
BIG	Sure.
CARRIE	To be clear it's just to keep each other company.
BIG	I always enjoy company.
CARRIE	Get it while it's hot!
BIG	"I thought it was just a ""company"" visit."
CARRIE	All your furniture's gone.
BIG	See? This is why I'm leaving New York.
BIG	The crime.
CARRIE	Leaving New York?
BIG	I'm moving.
CARRIE	You are not moving.
BIG	Tell that to my realtor in Napa.
CARRIE	Napa as in California?
BIG	I bought a vineyard. Half a vineyard.
BIG	"Technically, it's three-quarters of it but there's a dispute over a hillside."
CARRIE	"Take this pizza, and put it someplace."
CARRIE	Wait. You're moving? Moving when?
BIG	Monday at 5:00.
CARRIE	And if I hadn't happened to call tonight you were just going to quietly go away without telling me?
BIG	I'm not big on good-byes. I would have called you.
CARRIE	From where? A wine vat somewhere? You can't leave New York.
CARRIE	You're the Chrysler Building.
CARRIE	The Chrysler Building would be all wrong in a vineyard.
BIG	"Arrivederci, baby."
CARRIE	But why?
BIG	I'm tired of old New York.
CARRIE	"If you're tired, you take a nap-a."
CARRIE	You don't move to Napa.
CARRIE	I need a cocktail.
CARRIE	"And downtown, another woman was feeling deserted."
RICHARD	"Hey, gorgeous."
SAMANTHA	"Don't ""gorgeous"" me! You're three hours late."
SAMANTHA	I've eaten half a box of chocolates.
SAMANTHA	"When I get cellulite, you'll have no one to blame but yourself."
RICHARD	I got held up at the hotel.
SAMANTHA	"Richard, the telephone."
SAMANTHA	Have you two met?
RICHARD	"I was busy. What's up? I mean, besides me."
SAMANTHA	I don't appreciate being kept waiting.
SAMANTHA	Especially when I have a gift for you.
RICHARD	"Is this an actual gift, or are we talking sex?"
RICHARD	What's the occasion?
SAMANTHA	"It's national ""Richard's A Prick"" day."
SAMANTHA	"I saw it, and I thought of you. Do you like it?"
RICHARD	Very much.
CARRIE	It was the closest Samantha had come to giving her heart to a man in a long time.
SAMANTHA	I think it would be perfect right there.
CARRIE	"You kept nothing to sit on, but you have your records and a turntable?"
BIG	I know what's important.
CARRIE	"Blood, Sweat and Tears? Wow! Shouldn't this be in a museum?"
BIG	Be nice.
CARRIE	Henry Mancini.
CARRIE	Exactly how old are you?
BIG	"It was my parents', and don't knock it till you've heard it. Here."
CARRIE	Thank you.
CARRIE	"Easy, pops! Just give me the record."
CARRIE	I've been thinking.
CARRIE	You can't slink out of town this way.
CARRIE	We have to do it up right.
CARRIE	A proper good-bye.
CARRIE	"You, me, New York."
CARRIE	You owe it to us.
CARRIE	"And by ""us,"" I mean New York and myself."
BIG	How's that wine? It's from my vineyard.
CARRIE	"in That case, I hate it."
CARRIE	You can't be serious.
BIG	Wait.
CARRIE	So corny!
BIG	No. It's classic.
BIG	Listen.
BIG	This was my parents' favorite song.
BIG	They used to put it on before they went out on the town.
BIG	Listen.
BIG	"Did you hear that? ""Two drifters."
BIG	""" When I was little, I thought it was ""two twisters."
BIG	""" You know, the twist."
BIG	It was the '60s and my parents had the moves.
BIG	See? It got you.
CARRIE	Thank you for the company.
BIG	That's it? You can stay.
CARRIE	No.
CARRIE	I'll see you Sunday night.
CARRIE	Don't disappoint us.
BIG	"And by ""us,"" I mean you and me."
CARRIE	That pizza will be fantastic for breakfast.
CARRIE	"The next morning, I broke the Big news."
CARRIE	"Going, going, gone."
CARRIE	It's the end of an era.
SAMANTHA	I'm always surprised when anyone leaves New York.
SAMANTHA	Where do they go?
IRANDA	The real world?
SAMANTHA	A homeless man showed me his dick on the way here.
SAMANTHA	It doesn't get any realer.
CHARLOTTE	Big wasn't even going to tell you?
CARRIE	"No. He said he'd call, but what if he didn't?"
IRANDA	It's like the guys you have the great second date with and then never hear from again.
IRANDA	I pretend they died.
CARRIE	"Okay, now the tough question."
SAMANTHA	should You sleep with Him one last time?
CARRIE	Exactly.
CARRIE	Going-out-of-business sex.
CARRIE	What do we think?
IRANDA	no.
CARRIE	"Okay, Quick Draw."
CARRIE	Give it a second here.
IRANDA	no.
CARRIE	we like each other.
CARRIE	We respect each other.
CARRIE	It could be nice romantic.
IRANDA	no.
CHARLOTTE	You had sex with Steve.
SAMANTHA	Sex with an ex can be depressing.
SAMANTHA	"If it's good, you don't have it anymore."
SAMANTHA	"If it's bad, you just had sex with an ex."
CARRIE	It wouldn't be bad.
CARRIE	I'm just saying.
CARRIE	Aren't you afraid that the sheer force of it all will just pull you back into all that Big stuff again?
CARRIE	No. He's not Niagara Falls.
IRANDA	Isn't he?
CARRIE	"I love you, sweetie, but you're not giving me credit. This is not two years ago."
CARRIE	Things have changed.
CARRIE	I'm different now.
CARRIE	Big and I are different.
CARRIE	I feel safe around him.
CARRIE	"He's like this great man in my life, and he's leaving."
IRANDA	Use a condom.
IRANDA	That's all I'm saying.
SAMANTHA	"I don't know how you survived any of it, Big or Aidan."
SAMANTHA	This love stuff is a motherfucker.
CHARLOTTE	"Did you just say ""love""?"
SAMANTHA	"Oh, what the hell! My name is Samantha, and I'm a love-a-holic."
GROUP	"Hi, Samantha."
SAMANTHA	It's so infuriating.
SAMANTHA	"I mean, where can this possibly go? No one actually makes these relationship things work, do they?"
CARRIE	I think they're the same people who leave New York.
CHARLOTTE	I'm just really surprised Big is moving.
CHARLOTTE	I always thought Never mind.
CARRIE	"You always thought what, never mind?"
CHARLOTTE	I just always thought that you two would end up together.
IRANDA	How?
CARRIE	"I don't know. They made mistakes, but"
IRANDA	"They were never supposed to be together. If she was going to wind up with anybody, it was Aidan."
CARRIE	This is all very informative.
IRANDA	You don't have enough distance to have sex with your ex.
CARRIE	"Thanks for the sound advice, Mommy Biggest."
CHARLOTTE	I haven't had sex since my ex.
SAMANTHA	"Honey, you should get on that."
SAMANTHA	It's the only way to move on.
IRANDA	Use a condom.
CARRIE	"Later that night, I got to thinking about fate that crazy concept that we're not really responsible for the course our lives take."
CARRIE	"That it's all pre-destined, written in the stars."
CARRIE	"Maybe that explains why, if you live in a city where you can't even see the stars your love life tends to feel a little more random."
CARRIE	"And even if our every man, every kiss, every heartache is pre-ordered from some cosmic catalog can we still take a wrong step and wander off our own personal Milky Way? I couldn't help but wonder can you make a mistake and miss your fate?"
CHARLOTTE	"If you look at how brilliantly Monet suggested glimpses of sky and the luscious, tactile quality of the canvas you can see how he established his fate as one of the true poets of nature and my personal favorite."
CARRIE	Charlotte's fate led her to the Museum of Modern Art.
CHARLOTTE	"Follow me, and we'll move on to the Pollock."
CHARLOTTE	Weren't you here last Sunday?
ERIC	Yes. I was I love the lmpressionists.
ERIC	And I'm trying to get up the courage to invite you to dinner.
CHARLOTTE	"That's very sweet, but"
ERIC	"You have a boyfriend, right? How could you not?"
CHARLOTTE	"Actually, no boyfriend. But I was just separated, and I'm not really ready to date yet."
ERIC	I totally understand.
ERIC	I went through a divorce last year.
ERIC	"I'm Eric, by the way."
CHARLOTTE	Viewing Jackson Pollock's One is an almost overwhelming
BUNNY MACDOUGAL	Really?
CARRIE	"And speaking of overwhelming exes there was Charlotte's, with his mother, Bunny."
BUNNY MACDOUGAL	I detest Monet! He's such a sap.
TREY MACDOUGAL	"Mother, you have simply got to learn how to form an opinion."
CHARLOTTE	"Okay, enough Pollock."
CHARLOTTE	"Follow me, as we move on to Paul Gauguin."
CHARLOTTE	Now! Come on.
CHARLOTTE	I changed my mind.
CHARLOTTE	I'll have dinner with you.
CHARLOTTE	"Hurry, everyone."
CARRIE	"In order to avoid her ex, Charlotte ran all the way into the Expressionist era."
CARRIE	"And up on the Upper West Side, two other exes were dealing with A, B and Cs."
STEVE	"""Connect part C with bracket B and bolt 3."
IRANDA	""" Okay, now you're not even making sense."
IRANDA	That can't be right.
IRANDA	"""Connect part C to bracket B using bolt 3."
IRANDA	""" Hand me bolt 3."
IRANDA	Aren't you gonna point out you were right?
STEVE	"No, you've got 40 pounds on me."
IRANDA	I was thinking of Danny.
STEVE	Danny Who?
IRANDA	for the baby. Danny Hobbes.
STEVE	Danny.
STEVE	I like that.
IRANDA	Did you have any other ideas?
STEVE	Paul.
IRANDA	Paul!
STEVE	"Paul is a big name in the Brady family. You know, my dad and my granddad."
IRANDA	"Well, Paul."
STEVE	"But even then, Dad, you didn't even know him. Danny is better."
STEVE	"""Hey, Danny, you want to go shoot some hoops?"" It sounds right."
IRANDA	Good.
STEVE	Wow! We're making something for little Danny.
IRANDA	"Don't cry, Steve."
STEVE	Sorry.
RICHARD	"Gorgeous, I've got work to do here."
SAMANTHA	"You want out of this, just say it."
RICHARD	"I don't want to have sex once, and I want out?"
SAMANTHA	Not just once. What about yesterday?
RICHARD	we were at the opera.
SAMANTHA	I was bored.
RICHARD	I fucked you for three hours when we came home.
SAMANTHA	Big whoop! Why haven't you hung the hearts?
RICHARD	I will.
SAMANTHA	It's been laying against that wall for days.
RICHARD	I'm not sure it belongs here.
SAMANTHA	"You mean, I don't belong here."
CARRIE	"Samantha, a stranger to love, didn't do it very well."
RICHARD	"I heard the weather this morning, but they didn't say anything about a shit storm."
SAMANTHA	"Where were you on your lunch hour? I stopped by, and you weren't there."
RICHARD	I was eating.
SAMANTHA	"Eating who? I saw you get into a cab with a woman wearing come-fuck-me heels! Listen, Richard just tell me you're sleeping with someone else and we'll call it a day."
RICHARD	The hearts would be better in the den.
RICHARD	I had a salad and salmon.
RICHARD	The woman is a business associate.
RICHARD	I do not want out of this.
RICHARD	"But if you do, this is a good way to go."
SAMANTHA	I'm sorry.
RICHARD	She was an interior designer.
RICHARD	"You believe me, right?"
SAMANTHA	Yes. I do.
SAMANTHA	He's plowing someone else.
SAMANTHA	I know it.
SAMANTHA	How could he not be? The man was a tramp.
CARRIE	You're not cheating on him.
CARRIE	Miracles happen.
SAMANTHA	I think he's doing it on his lunch hour.
SAMANTHA	I'll follow him.
CARRIE	"Oh, Jesus!"
SAMANTHA	He won't know it's me. I've got a wig from the Raquel Welch wig line.
CARRIE	The Raquel Welch wig line?
SAMANTHA	"Sassy shag, chestnut brown, cute. Very realistic for synthetic hair."
CARRIE	And why would you be doing this?
SAMANTHA	"I can't go any farther down this love road and have my heart broken. If he's cheating on me, I have to know now."
CARRIE	"Samantha, if you love him don't you think there's even the slightest chance that he might really love you, too?"
SAMANTHA	I stole a key from his cleaning lady. I'm gonna sneak in and check his answering machine
CARRIE	"I do not have bail money, just so you know."
CARRIE	"Hello, lover! I am needing those for my last Big night on the town."
SAMANTHA	What are you two going to do?
CARRIE	"Drinks, dinner, dancing. Very old New York."
SAMANTHA	"I meant, sex or no sex?"
CARRIE	Please. I'm just getting around to picking the shoes.
CHARLOTTE	Our mistake was we never really agreed on what each other wanted out of the marriage.
ERIC	"My wife and I, totally different backgrounds."
ERIC	And you would think we'd be able to see that was gonna be the problem.
ERIC	"But, nope."
ERIC	We were in love.
CHARLOTTE	"Love, right?"
ERIC	"Love is tricky. I mean, it's just so hard to see clearly through it."
CHARLOTTE	Exactly.
CHARLOTTE	It's like a fog or something.
CHARLOTTE	"You're very sweet, Eric."
CARRIE	"And after dinner, Charlotte invited Eric home for coffee and The ""and"" being, I'm-determined-to-move-on-from-my-ex sex."
ERIC	Wow! This place is huge. You live here alone?
CHARLOTTE	It's not that big.
ERIC	Not that big? Wow! Look in there.
ERIC	"Was your ex, like, a king or something?"
CHARLOTTE	He was a doctor.
ERIC	Look at the size of this place.
ERIC	I live in a studio.
ERIC	You're rich.
ERIC	"My ex-wife was an orthodox Jew, and now you're a rich girl."
ERIC	Why can't I ever find a woman who's compatible with me?
CHARLOTTE	You know what? I'm not really feeling that well. Maybe you should go.
ERIC	"Jesus Christ, it's huge! It goes all the way back there. Wow."
CHARLOTTE	Follow me.
ERIC	good idea.
CHARLOTTE	Charlotte realized she may be ready to deal with her marriage past but not her dating future.
CHARLOTTE	I had a lovely dinner.
CHARLOTTE	Bye.
CARRIE	Contrary to popular opinion I have decided to give myself permission to sleep with Big if it feels right.
CARRIE	So put that in your pipe and smoke it.
IRANDA	You're a big girl.
CARRIE	Can I get that in writing? It had better stop raining before tonight.
CARRIE	"I have the most amazing shoes, and water will just not do."
CARRIE	What? Are you having a baby or something?
IRANDA	Damn! And that was just a kick. Wait till the labor starts.
CARRIE	You okay?
IRANDA	"I'm getting a little freaked. Will you be in the room with me? Steve's a good coach, but he's too emotional."
IRANDA	I'm going to need something normal to look at.
IRANDA	It'll make me calmer.
CARRIE	"Okay, but I'm there purely for decoration."
CARRIE	I'm not cutting any umbilical anything.
CARRIE	"That night, after the rain, after the dinner, after the dancing I took Big for a ride."
BIG	I can't believe you actually talked me into this.
BIG	Buggy ride in Central Park.
BIG	very corny.
CARRIE	Nope.
CARRIE	Classic.
CARRIE	"What are you going to do out there in Napa, besides watch grapes shrivel?"
BIG	"Work, smoke cigars Iook at the stars."
CARRIE	I give it a week.
CARRIE	New York. New York.
CARRIE	Aren't you going to miss it?
BIG	"Nah. But I will miss you, kid."
BIG	Very much.
BIG	Your cell phone's ringing.
CARRIE	I don't own a cell phone.
CARRIE	"Oh, Jesus, that is me! Miranda gave me one, because, you know How the hell does this thing Thank you."
CARRIE	Miranda?
IRANDA	"Hi, I'm in labor. Meet me at Mount Sinai, at 99th and Fifth."
CARRIE	"Okay, is Steve with you?"
IRANDA	"No, he's on his way from the bar. I didn't think I should wait."
CARRIE	are You okay?
IRANDA	
IRANDA	I gotta go.
CARRIE	Miranda's in labor.
CARRIE	"I have to get out of here, to Mount Sinai."
BIG	"Excuse me, sir."
BIG	We have an emergency.
BIG	We need to get to 99th Street and Fifth Avenue in a hurry.
BOBBO	I can't leave the park.
BOBBO	I'll get a fine.
BIG	What's your name?
BOBBO	Bobbo.
BIG	"Okay, Bobbo."
BIG	Here is $400.
BIG	See what you can do.
CARRIE	"One short carriage ride later So, you leave tomorrow at 5:00?"
CARRIE	How about lunch? I'll come over around 2:00?
BIG	I can't believe you're leaving me alone with a horse and buggy.
CARRIE	"Thanks for the ride, Prince Charming."
BIG	"Anytime. Carrie. 81st and Park, Bobbo."
HOSPITAL INTERCOM	"Dr. Thomas, call postpartum emergency."
CARRIE	"Boy, you will do anything to stop me from having sex with Big."
IRANDA	You look pretty.
CARRIE	So do you.
CARRIE	"Shouldn't you be lying down, or biting on a leather strap or something?"
IRANDA	"I'm moving around, trying to get my water to break. The doctor says it's better than having them break it for you."
CARRIE	"So, what can I do?"
IRANDA	"When this gets going, don't let anyone get all cheerleadery on me. I don't want any of that ""You can do it, push!"" shit."
CARRIE	"And thus, with a destroyed pair of Christian Louboutins began Miranda's delivery."
CARRIE	And it would continue well into lunch hour the next day.
CARRIE	"There she was, Miss Sassy-in-her-shag trying to catch Richard with his lunchtime shag."
SAMANTHA	Follow that car!
NYC CAB DRIVER	Are you fucking kidding me?
SAMANTHA	Just go.
CARRIE	"One cab ride, and a breaking-and-entering later Samantha found herself at Richard's bedroom door."
SAMANTHA	You bastard!
RICHARD	Who the hell are you? It's just sex. I love you.
CARRIE	Turns out she was right about Wright.
CARRIE	But now she wished she was wrong.
SAMANTHA	"There! Now your heart's broken, too!"
WOMAN	Who the fuck was that?
CARRIE	Turns out the baby was almost as stubborn as Miranda.
STEVE	You're doing good there.
DELIVERY NURSE	"That's right, you're almost there. Now push!"
CARRIE	"Nurse, don't say that."
DOCTOR	"Okay, Miranda, one more deep breath. And go."
IRANDA	Carrie.
STEVE	"Oh, my God! There he is!"
DOCTOR	And he's perfect.
DELIVERY NURSE	Yes he is! He's perfect! He's perfect! He's perfect!
CARRIE	Nurse.
STEVE	"Ten toes ten fingers, two balls."
CARRIE	That feels Good.
CARRIE	You did it.
STEVE	Carrie.
CARRIE	"And just like that, life comes in and things begin to change."
IRANDA	It's weird.
IRANDA	It's like suddenly there's a giraffe in the room.
IRANDA	Hello.
STEVE	"Hey, Danny."
IRANDA	I was thinking Brady.
IRANDA	Brady Hobbes.
CARRIE	Steve.
CARRIE	That's a fabulous hat.
CARRIE	Hi!
CHARLOTTE	Well?
CARRIE	"He's really teeny, and he has red hair."
CHARLOTTE	"Really? Oh, my God, that is so cute!"
CARRIE	"Listen, I have to go. I still have a chance to catch Big."
CARRIE	"Oh, Jesus! Here comes Raquel Welch."
CARRIE	I'm late.
CARRIE	She'll tell you.
CHARLOTTE	Why are you wearing that wig?
SAMANTHA	Because my hair under it looks like shit!
CHARLOTTE	Miranda has a son.
SAMANTHA	"Just what the world needs, another man."
CHARLOTTE	"Come on, let's go see the baby!"
SAMANTHA	Wait. Okay.
CHARLOTTE	All Right.
CARRIE	No.
CARRIE	It's not even 5:00.
CARRIE	"What is this? ""If I ever feel lonely"" It was official."
CARRIE	A new season had begun.
CARRIE	Maybe our mistakes are what make our fate.
CARRIE	"Without them, what would shape our lives? Perhaps, if we never veered off-course we wouldn't fall in love, or have babies, or be who we are."
CARRIE	"After all, seasons change."
CARRIE	So do cities.
CARRIE	People come into your life and people go.
CARRIE	"But it's comforting to know the ones you love are always in your heart and, if you're very lucky a plane ride away."
CARRIE	"When you are single in New York, there is no end to ways to fill your days."
CARRIE	"Museums, parks, theatres, concert halls, nightclubs and countless restaurants."
CARRIE	"But one of the most amazing things about living in New York is that any night, you can go to Paris."
CARRIE	"""Joy For Two"" for one."
OVIE ATTENDANT	Enjoy the show.
CARRIE	Thank you.
CARRIE	It was one of those perfect New York nights.
SAMANTHA	That fucking Richard.
CARRIE	Followed by a less than perfect New York day.
SAMANTHA	"He left anothern ""I'm sorry"" message on my machine"
SAMANTHA	Like all the im sorrys in the world are going to make up for the fact that i caught him eating another woman's pussy
CHARLOTTE	Samantha! It's OK.
IRANDA	Nothing has to change.
IRANDA	think Of this as a big purse.
CARRIE	your purse Just spit up.
SAMANTHA	You'd think after three weeks he'd get the message.
SAMANTHA	Not OK to eat another woman's pussy.
CHARLOTTE	"Samantha, Brady!"
SAMANTHA	"Well i'm pissed off, What am I supposed to say?"
CARRIE	Call it another woman's sushi.
SAMANTHA	Fine.
SAMANTHA	Richard ate her sushi.
IRANDA	Fish and chips would have been an unfortunate order.
CHARLOTTE	What did You do last night?
CARRIE	went a movie
CHARLOTTE	with Who?
CARRIE	myself
CHARLOTTE	on date night?
CARRIE	"are we stil gonna have to call it ""date night in our fifties?"
CHARLOTTE	"I would just be thinking people would be looking at me thinking ""That poor, pathetic girl."""
IRANDA	""" Like how I'm looking at you now?"
CHARLOTTE	What?
IRANDA	You don't go out alone?
CHARLOTTE	On Date night?
CARRIE	You're never alone in new york it's the perfect place to be single
CARRIE	The city is your date.
IRANDA	You're dating the city?
CARRIE	about 18 years
CARRIE	It's getting serious.
CARRIE	I think I'm in love.
CHARLOTTE	do not Check your messages.
SAMANTHA	I'm not.
SAMANTHA	I wanted you to hear his tone on my machine.
CHARLOTTE	"If you keep participating, you might as well call him."
SAMANTHA	I'm not participating.
CHARLOTTE	this has to stop.
CHARLOTTE	It's tragic you were in love and it didn't work.
CHARLOTTE	"You have to emotionally cut him out and the sooner, the better."
CHARLOTTE	Everyone knows you only get two great loves.
CARRIE	Everyone who? Where did you get that?
CHARLOTTE	I read it in a magazine
IRANDA	"""Convenient Theories For You Monthly""?"
CHARLOTTE	What Does That mean?
IRANDA	"It means last year When you were married,"
IRANDA	You believed in one Great love.
CARRIE	"Yeah and that phrase ""great love"" what does that even mean?"
CHARLOTTE	"it means a love that changes you, that shakes you to your core, after which you're never the same."
CHARLOTTE	Seriously.
CHARLOTTE	There is not unlimited love in the world.
CHARLOTTE	It's rare.
CARRIE	Way to take the edge off a club sandwich.
CHARLOTTE	So far I've had one Trey.
CARRIE	How many have you had?
IRANDA	Zero
CARRIE	Really? What about Steve?
IRANDA	Steve's a friend. not a core shaker
SAMANTHA	I'm done with great love.

CHARLOTTE	"come on, Carrie."
CHARLOTTE	Aidan and Big.
CARRIE	"One, two."
CARRIE	"According to you, I'm done."
CHARLOTTE	"No, it was a stupid article."
CHARLOTTE	It was at the dentist.
CARRIE	"No, it's too late for that."
CARRIE	You said it.
CARRIE	It's over for me.
CARRIE	Here lies Carrie.
CARRIE	She had two loves and lots of shoes.
SAMANTHA	Fuck love.

SAMANTHA	"Ladies, seamen, 12 o'clock."
IRANDA	I pray when I turn around there are sailors.
IRANDA	"With her, you never know."
CARRIE	"Oh, wow! We have just spotted our first sailors."
CARRIE	Fleet Week has begun.
CARRIE	"Fleet Week is that one week a year when the US Naval ships dock, and our fair city is made even fairer with cute, sweet, American sailors looking for fun."
SAMANTHA	I've been so distracted by Richard.
SAMANTHA	I almost forgot my favourite holiday.
CHARLOTTE	It isn't a holiday.
SAMANTHA	It should be.
CARRIE	The antidote to Valentine's Day.
SAMANTHA	Just what I need.
SAMANTHA	I'm gonna find out about the big party.
CARRIE	"Hold on, Pearl Harbor."

IRANDA	okay!
ELEVATOR DOORMAN	"Have a good evening, Mrs MacDougal."
 CARRIE	"Charlotte realised she may have put great love number one behind her, but his name was still in front of her."
CARRIE	Break-ups.
CARRIE	"Bad for the heart, good for the economy."
RICHARD	It's the bad guy again.
RICHARD	I'll keep calling till you agree to talk.
RICHARD	"Unless you want 20 messages every day, meet me tonight."
RICHARD	I miss you.
RICHARD	"I'll be waiting, gorgeous."
CARRIE	Right sentiment.
RICHARD	Sushi Samba.
CARRIE	Wrong restaurant.
RESTAURANT HOSTESS	Richard? Right this way.
RICHARD	"Hello, gorgeous."
RICHARD	"In a wildly optimistic gesture, I ordered you a dirty martini."
SAMANTHA	Dirty martini? Dirty bastard.
CARRIE	"I have always wanted to do that, but I don't think I could."
CARRIE	How did it feel? -
SAMANTHA	Fabulous.
SAMANTHA	But I woke up this morning even angrier.
SAMANTHA	I need to hurt him more.
SAMANTHA	I can't be around that man.
SAMANTHA	He's dangerous and toxic.
CARRIE	"So, he's ""manthrax""?"
SAMANTHA	Arrogant prick!
CARRIE	I wonder what he was gonna say.
SAMANTHA	"That he loves me, we belong together, he didn't mean to hurt me."
CARRIE	People make mistakes.
CARRIE	I cheated on Aidan.
CARRIE	He gave me a second chance.
CARRIE	Look how that turned out.
SAMANTHA	That was different.
CARRIE	true.
CARRIE	It wasn't a sushi situation.
SAMANTHA	That's another thing.
SAMANTHA	I'm not doing the baby talk at breakfast.
SAMANTHA	"I signed up for friendship, not bullshit baby brunches."
CARRIE	You're overreacting.
CARRIE	Brady won't happen every day.
SAMANTHA	He'd better not.
CARRIE	Miranda's still Miranda.
CARRIE	"She had a baby, not a loboTomy."
CARRIE	She knows you're not child-friendly.
SAMANTHA	Don't kid yourself.
SAMANTHA	"Days of ""pussy"" and ""fuck"" are gone."
CARRIE	"Later that night, I got to thinking about days gone by."
CARRIE	That carefree time when our schedules were as open as our hearts.
CARRIE	The time before the baggage and babies began to weigh us down.
CARRIE	"I couldn't help wonder, does that sense of adventure still flicker inside us? Or when it comes to being carefree single girls, have we missed the boat?"
CARRIE	Surprise! Pain au chocolat.
CARRIE	"Oh, I'm sorry."
CARRIE	I don't know you.
CARRIE	I'm Carrie.
IRANDA	"I'm a friend of Hi, this is Lina."
IRANDA	Come in.
CARRIE	Does she speak?
IRANDA	"No, I love her."
IRANDA	Were we supposed to do something and I forgot it?
CARRIE	"No, I had the day free and thought I'd stop by for a chatty."
IRANDA	"Fatty, come on."
IRANDA	I've gotta sit.
CARRIE	are You hungry? I brought some pain au chocolat.
IRANDA	"Thanks, but the only eating I'm concerned with now is Brady."
IRANDA	He doesn't want to eat.
CARRIE	Perhaps he's anorexic.
IRANDA	"Sorry, what?"
CARRIE	It's a dumb joke.
IRANDA	What was it?
CARRIE	Anorexic.
IRANDA	"Oh, yeah no."
IRANDA	I've been trying to feed him for an hour and he won't latch on Stop.
IRANDA	Boring.
IRANDA	What's up with you?
CARRIE	"Well, I've been thinking about that thing that Charlotte said in the coffee shop."
IRANDA	About the great loves? Here we go.
CARRIE	"So maybe Aidan and Big are my two great loves, now."
CARRIE	But that doesn't mean that that I'm always gonna feel that way about them.
IRANDA	"come on, Brady."
IRANDA	It's right here.
IRANDA	"OK, you don't want it? Fine."
IRANDA	Here we go.
CARRIE	"There, in the middle of my two great loves, were Miranda's two great breasts."
IRANDA	I'm sorry. What?
CARRIE	Your breasts are huge!
IRANDA	"No, what were you saying? I can't even remember. This is so frustrating."
CARRIE	He'll eat eventually.
IRANDA	"No, not that."
IRANDA	This is frustrating.
IRANDA	I can't follow your thoughts.
IRANDA	It's all nursing and nipples.
CARRIE	"Sweetie, they're looking right at me."
IRANDA	I am not gonna become one of those mothers who cannot carry on an adult conversation.
IRANDA	I am not.
IRANDA	"Three weeks ago, I would've been listening and saying funny things."
IRANDA	"Now I'm going, ""What?"" I didn't get the anorexic joke."
IRANDA	how easy was that?
CARRIE	I'm just talking.
CARRIE	It's just words.
IRANDA	They're your words.
IRANDA	It's not just now.
IRANDA	"Could Samantha have gotten me into that cab faster? Carrie, my friendships are important to me."
CARRIE	We're not going anywhere.
CARRIE	Things will have to change a little.
IRANDA	Fuck.
CARRIE	I know.
CARRIE	But you're still one of us.
CARRIE	"Only now, you're the one with the biggest boobs."
IRANDA	Can you believe the size of my nipples?
CARRIE	"Please, I was not at all prepared. I'm gonna have to find some trauma counselling."
IRANDA	There.
IRANDA	We have contact.
CARRIE	OK.
CARRIE	I'm gonna go.
CARRIE	Let you concentrate on Mr Hobbes.
IRANDA	You don't have to go.
IRANDA	I can listen now.
IRANDA	I can do it.
CARRIE	"Miranda, you're a mother."
CARRIE	But it's OK.
CARRIE	I won't tell anyone.

CARRIE	Bye.
CARRIE	"That same afternoon, Charlotte felt like going to a movie."
CARRIE	"She called her afternoon movie friend, Anthony."
CHARLOTTE	Carrie says the French film at The Paris is amazing.
ANTHONY	Fuck the French.
ANTHONY	Like I need to spend an afternoon looking at that shit.
ANTHONY	good hat.
CHARLOTTE	Thanks.
CHARLOTTE	What do you want to see?
ANTHONY	Anything with Josh Hartnett.
CHARLOTTE	I don't know him.
ANTHONY	"He's cute, with a capital 'U' He totally checked you out."
ANTHONY	Get his number.
CHARLOTTE	He's a sailor.
ANTHONY	I know! Hurry! He's getting away.
CHARLOTTE	I can't do that.
ANTHONY	You are So not gay.
CHARLOTTE	What am I going to do with him?
ANTHONY	
ANTHONY	you've been dragging around.
CHARLOTTE	I'm not dragging anything around.
CHARLOTTE	I changed my name back to York on my mailbox.
ANTHONY	Good for you.
ANTHONY	Maybe you should be thinking about a different box.
ANTHONY	"When did you last have sex? If you have to think, it's been too long."
CHARLOTTE	when was the last time?
ANTHONY	9:29 today at the gym.
CHARLOTTE	I'm not looking for just sex.
CHARLOTTE	I can have just sex.
CHARLOTTE	I'm looking for my next great love.
ANTHONY	yeah well Don't let it hit that six month mark.
ANTHONY	"After that, it's a sleigh ride into menopause."
ANTHONY	"If you don't put something in there soon, it will grow over."
CHARLOTTE	What is it with this friggin' wind?
CARRIE	"As Charlotte and Anthony made a left, Samantha found herself in the right neighbourhood, Richard's."

POLICE	"Carry on, ma'am."
CARRIE	"New York weather, like a man, can be unpredictable."
CARRIE	But that's part of the fun.
CARRIE	"And a New York museum, like a man, can sometimes be closed when you wish they were open."
CARRIE	That's another reason I love New York.
CARRIE	"Just like that, it can go from bad to cute."
CARRIE	"Well, I guess we're not going anywhere for a while."
CARRIE	I love the way the rain smells.
CARRIE	"If this were a French movie, we'd fall in love and get married."
CARRIE	"No, I was just pointing out how romantic this would be in a movie."
CARRIE	I don't want to marry you.
CARRIE	"OK, I do! Come on."
CARRIE	I'm kidding.
CARRIE	We just met.
CARRIE	Let's wait five minutes.

RESTAURANT MANAGER	Two! Who's next?
CARRIE	"Several blocks later, I decided to warm up with a bowl of matzo ball soup."
RESTAURANT MANAGER	"Come on, come on! Let's go!"
LADY AT RESTAURANT	That manager's really a prick.
LADY AT RESTAURANT	I put up with it because I come here all the time.
LADY AT RESTAURANT	They know me.
LADY AT RESTAURANT	I live in the neighbourhood.
LADY AT RESTAURANT	We single gals got to have a port in a storm.
LADY AT RESTAURANT	Am I right? Lithium.
LADY AT RESTAURANT	I like to sprinkle it on my ice cream.

CARRIE	"No, can't say that I have."
LADY AT RESTAURANT	What kind of mood elevator are you on?
CARRIE	I'm not on one.
LADY AT RESTAURANT	Yeah? I used to be like you.
LADY AT RESTAURANT	Then I broke up with this guy.
LADY AT RESTAURANT	This was '82.
LADY AT RESTAURANT	Morty.
LADY AT RESTAURANT	Thought somebody better would come along.
LADY AT RESTAURANT	Never happened.
LADY AT RESTAURANT	"Oh, I love this!"
CARRIE	"If Charlotte was right, this woman's two great loves were a man named Morty and lithium-laced ice cream."
CARRIE	"After 20 minutes squatting under the coffee shop hand dryer, I realised I'd been kidding myself."
CARRIE	New York and I didn't have the perfect relationship.
CARRIE	"All right! It was dismissive, abusive, and it made me feel desperate."
CARRIE	I was now fresh out of great loves.
CARRIE	"Hey, sir! Thank you."

YOUNG SAILOR 2	"evening, Miss."
SAMANTHA	
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, I had not found Charlotte, but Charlotte had found an officer who wasn't a gentleman."
SHIP OFFICER	show me your tits?
CHARLOTTE	I can't do that.
CHARLOTTE	I barely know you.
SHIP OFFICER	OK.
SHIP OFFICER	Just show me one.

CHARLOTTE	I can't do this.
CARRIE	Let's just talk.
SHIP OFFICER	"It's your call, Ma'am."
CARRIE	Charlotte was caught somewhere between the old and new York.
CARRIE	She figured showing her boob to a stranger bought her three months.
SAMANTHA	Carrie! There you are.
SAMANTHA	Where's Charlotte?
CARRIE	"Believe it or not, she's involved in a peep show upstairs."
SAMANTHA	I'm starting to have a new-found respect for that girl.
CARRIE	"What is it about today? I've seen Miranda's boobs, Charlotte's boob."
CARRIE	Why not show me yours and get it over with? I was kidding.
SAMANTHA	I wasn't.
SAMANTHA	That ought to hook me a sailor.
CARRIE	"Yeah, Tailhook you one."
CARRIE	I'm going.
SAMANTHA	No!
CARRIE	yes! I was right.
CARRIE	"This ship has sailed and tragically, I'm still on it."
CARRIE	Good night.
CARRIE	"Hey, keep an eye on Boom Boom up there."
LOUIS	"Hey, there."
LOUIS	You came.
CARRIE	Yes.
CARRIE	"I came, I saw, I'm leaving."
LOUIS	come on.
LOUIS	I've come all the way from Louisiana to dance with a New York city girl.
LOUIS	I'm a good dancer.
CARRIE	Even though she was floating in a sea of dickies-
VOICE MAIL	one new message and 12 saved messages
CARRIE	Samantha could only think about Richard.
RICHARD	You threw a drink in my face and papered my neighbourhood.
RICHARD	"Would I still call if I didn't really love you? I love you, gorgeous."
RICHARD	Give me another chance.
RICHARD	You threw a drink in my face and papered my neighbourhood.
RICHARD	Would I still be calling if I didn't really love you?
CARRIE	"Say, Louis from Louisiana, how many great loves do you think you get in a lifetime?"
LOUIS	Great loves?
CARRIE	That is the question on deck.
LOUIS	"Maybe one, if you're lucky."
CARRIE	"Well, I'm glad I stayed."
CARRIE	"After this city kicked my ass today, I needed that dance."
LOUIS	"I have to say, this is my first trip to New York."
LOUIS	Not for me.
LOUIS	"The garbage, the noise."
LOUIS	I don't know how you put up with it.
CARRIE	Thanks.
CARRIE	Goodnight.
LOUIS	Wait.
LOUIS	Going home all alone? It's rough out there.
CARRIE	It isn't so bad.
CARRIE	"If Louis was right, and you only get one great love, New York may just be mine."
CARRIE	I can't have nobody talking shit about my boyfriend.
CARRIE	"A short while later, I had a thought."
CARRIE	Maybe the past is like an anchor holding us back.
CARRIE	Maybe you have to let go of who you were to become who you will be.
CARRIE	The worst thing about not being in a relationship is when your job is to write about being in a relationship.
CARRIE	"Remember that guy who wore sandals, Randal the sandal guy? We had a couple of dates."
IRANDA	Six years ago?
CARRIE	"Yeah, Is that anything?"
CHARLOTTE	His name was randall?
CARRIE	No but I'm scraping the botTom of the barrel. last week I wrote about my search for the perfect French fry.
IRANDA	It was cute.
SAMANTHA	French fries.
CARRIE	"You didn't read it, did you?"
SAMANTHA	I don't always have time to read your columns
CARRIE	"OK, then."
CARRIE	Wow! Even my friends find me irrelevant.
IRANDA	I read It every week.
SAMANTHA	You have a little man hanging from your breast.
SAMANTHA	What else are You gonna do?
IRANDA	Eat
CARRIE	I'm in a dating desert.
CARRIE	"They'll have to change my column to And The City""."
CARRIE	Or they'll cancel it.
SAMANTHA	You're on the side of a bus.
CARRIE	Why did my editor call? He never calls.
CARRIE	I'm not getting laid.
CARRIE	There for I'm getting laid off.
SAMANTHA	You're not getting laid off.
CARRIE	"I don't know if you read the rest of the paper, but people with real jobs are getting laid off."
CARRIE	This is not a good economy in which to be whipped cream.
CARRIE	Last night I started writing about my sock drawer.
CARRIE	Men as socks.
SAMANTHA	"""Socks And The City""."
CHARLOTTE	You and I need to find some men.
IRANDA	There are No men.
CARRIE	There are men! You have to know where to look for them. When are you free? I
CARRIE	I'm not trawling for men to have something to write.
CARRIE	Go have sex.
CARRIE	Report back.
IRANDA	I can only help with baby-proofing.
SAMANTHA	i'll tell you how to baby proof. use a condom
WAITRESS	What can I get you?
CHARLOTTE	The veggie scramble and wheat toast.
CARRIE	I'll have fries.
CARRIE	Maybe I'll make it a two-parter.
IRANDA	Denver omelette and hash browns.
SAMANTHA	The fruit plate.
SAMANTHA	And I'm back with Richard.
CHARLOTTE	"Richard, whose death we've been plotting?"
CARRIE	Wow Maybe there are no men.
SAMANTHA	I finally listened to what he had to say and-
RICHARD	I've never known anyone like you.
RICHARD	I was in over my head.
RICHARD	I got scared.
IRANDA	He got scared?
CHARLOTTE	That doesn't excuse the
CARRIE	okay That coming from you is almost as disturbing as the news itself.
IRANDA	"I get scared, I hide under the covers, not between somebody's legs."
SAMANTHA	You had to be there.
CARRIE	You'll have to be there so he doesn't get scared again.
SAMANTHA	Being scared is not easy for a man to admit.
IRANDA	They get a medal for identifying a feeling? We do that all day long.
IRANDA	I feel pissed off.
CARRIE	do not resuscitate.
SAMANTHA	I'm not an idiot.
SAMANTHA	I understand that Richard is a charismatic and successful man.
SAMANTHA	An interesting pussy might cross his path and he might fall It's just sex.
SAMANTHA	That might be a fall
CARRIE	Into it
SAMANTHA	That migh be a flaw in him but you know what? nobodys perfect
SAMANTHA	Some women can't get their husbands to pick up the dry cleaning.
IRANDA	You're comparing not picking up the dry cleaning with Do the thing.
SAMANTHA	I know he loves me.
SAMANTHA	I believe he's sorry.
SAMANTHA	I believe he'll try his best.
CARRIE	That's your choice and we should all respect it.
CARRIE	"Now, How about this for a column? ""Desperate Women Who Will Believe Anything""."
CARRIE	"The next day, two parents covered outlets to prevent their baby from getting shocked."
STEVE	I was thinking Maybe we want to get Brady baptised.
CARRIE	"For grown-ups, there is no such safeguard."
IRANDA	Neither Of us goes to church.
STEVE	"I know, but it's tradition."
STEVE	"I was baptised, my father, my father's father."
STEVE	Everybody in my family.
STEVE	It Would mean a lot to my ma.
IRANDA	your ma? You never had a Mother when we were going out.
IRANDA	This is the first I've heard of her.
IRANDA	You are just making a case for religion.
STEVE	It's not about religion or God.
STEVE	It's something you do in case So baby don't end up in limbo.
IRANDA	You don't know what that means.
STEVE	I do so.
IRANDA	What is it?
STEVE	"a place where babies fly around without bodies, Just wings Under Their neck."
IRANDA	That sounds like something we should worry about.
STEVE	"Brady isn't crawling, and you've got us baby-proofing this apartment."
STEVE	But you won't let someone sprinkle water on him so he doesn't go to hell?
CARRIE	"Miranda didn't believe in hell, except the hell she was in right now."
IRANDA	This is why I was worried about involving you.
IRANDA	Why should I go through some ceremony to make your ma happy?
STEVE	It's nice! Everybody sees the baby.
STEVE	You have cake.
STEVE	Some people give money.
STEVE	What's wrong with a party?
IRANDA	I don't believe in it.
STEVE	If you don't believe It's just water on the kid's head.
CARRIE	"Downtown, Samantha's faith was faltering."
SAMANTHA	My friends don't believe you.
RICHARD	am I dating your friends?
SAMANTHA	I wouldn't put it past you.
RICHARD	What's their problem?
SAMANTHA	This is their problem.
RICHARD	we talked about that.
SAMANTHA	Miranda thinks it's bullshit.
SAMANTHA	What's to stop you getting scared every time a hot woman walks by?
SAMANTHA	she wanted to know.
RICHARD	I don't give a shit what they think.
RICHARD	"I love you, and I've got something for you."
SAMANTHA	Unless Miranda wouldn't approve.
CARRIE	Now it was Samantha's turn to be scared.
RICHARD	Don't worry.
RICHARD	"It's not for that finger, it's for this one."
RICHARD	"When you flip me off, I'll have something shiny to look at."
CARRIE	There it was.
CARRIE	"A canary diamond, ""I'll try not to cheat and eat when I'm scared"" ring."
CARRIE	Samantha wasn't sure if she was in heaven or limbo.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, I was clearly in hell."
CARRIE	"That afternoon, Charlotte and I went trawling for men."
CHARLOTTE	He's kind of cute.
CARRIE	We were playing 1/100.
CARRIE	It's like a road trip game for urban singles.
CARRIE	"Watch the men coming your direction, and see how many out of 100 you'd sleep with."
CHARLOTTE	"okay yes, 8 out of 46, where are you?"
CARRIE	"Zero, 32."
CHARLOTTE	"zero, What about the guy with the dog?"
CARRIE	I don't like dachshunds for men.
CARRIE	"Can't handle a real dog, can't handle a real woman."
CHARLOTTE	he was gorgeous.
CARRIE	"Men who are too good-looking are never good in bed, because they never had to be."
CARRIE	"Zero, 35."
CHARLOTTE	None Of them?
CARRIE	They were gay.
CHARLOTTE	It's imaginary.
CHARLOTTE	There must be someone you'd have imaginary sex with.
CHARLOTTE	You're being picky.
CARRIE	You're an imaginary whore.
CHARLOTTE	I am not.
CARRIE	You have slept with eight men and we have only had appetizers.
CHARLOTTE	You should come with me to Dr Cheryl Grayson's seminar.
CHARLOTTE	It's really inspiring.
CHARLOTTE	There's time for questions and answers.
CHARLOTTE	She has a new haircut and I hear it's cute.
CARRIE	Why Would I Go to that?
CHARLOTTE	Because you're becoming cynical.
CARRIE	That's why I wouldn't go.
CARRIE	"It's kind of a catch-22, isn't it?"
CHARLOTTE	You might get a column out Of it.
CARRIE	sign me up.
CHARLOTTE	Yeah! I think you'll really enjoy it.
CHARLOTTE	Her philosophy of written affirmations has helped me let go of negative thoughts.
CHARLOTTE	"No, not this guy."
CHARLOTTE	He's balding.
CHARLOTTE	He's got a big head.
CARRIE	You have some negative thoughts.
CHARLOTTE	"Oh, my God."
CHARLOTTE	He's coming over here.
CHARLOTTE	Don't look up.
GABE	"Aren't you Carrie Bradshaw from ""The New York Star""?"
CHARLOTTE	"Gabe, Hey!"
CHARLOTTE	You know each other?
CARRIE	This is my editor.
CARRIE	this is Gabe Manning.
CHARLOTTE	"Hi, I'm Charlotte."
GABE	I'm glad I ran into you since you don't return your calls.
CARRIE	I know.
CARRIE	But I am just now researching my next column.
CARRIE	I think it's going to be super fun and sexy.
CARRIE	We sit here and pick how many men out of 100 we would sleep with.
GABE	"No one's asking to fuck every guy in town, We're only a weekly paper."
CARRIE	"No, we don't actually"
GABE	I've been trying to get in touch An editor from Clearwater Press called.
GABE	They're interested in turning your columns into a book.
CARRIE	oh
GABE	oh
CARRIE	oh!
LILY	I'm having a Cosmopolitan with the woman who wrote about them.
LILY	If only I could find a man.
COURTNEY	Trouble finding a man.
CARRIE	Have you considered writing about that? Great idea.
CARRIE	Let me get a pen.
CARRIE	"The next night, I met publishing powerhouses Lily Martin and Courtney Masterson."
COURTNEY	This is a thrill.
COURTNEY	All of us at Clearwater Press read your column religiously.
CARRIE	I don't even do that.
LILY	"I have ""Ten Men To Avoid"" on my refrigerator."
COURTNEY	"But not in that icky ""Cathy"" comic way."
LILY	I hate That shit.
COURTNEY	me too.
COURTNEY	I predict this book will be Huge.
LILY	Huge.
CARRIE	And that's Why?
COURTNEY	Because There are so many single women desperate for something like this.
COURTNEY	You're looking at two.
COURTNEY	One.
COURTNEY	Two.
LILY	You already have an inventory of columns to choose from.
CARRIE	Some we don't have to include.
CARRIE	"That one on French fries didn't make the fridge, did it?"
COURTNEY	"We want to fast track it, get it on the shelves by Christmas/Hanukkah."
LILY	"You can pick the columns, about 25 or 30."
LILY	Write an introduction and dedication to clarify the tone.
CARRIE	So you mean What do you mean?
LILY	"You know, what's the message?"
CARRIE	Just here are my favourite columns?
LILY	"Yes, but also, is it hopeful?"
COURTNEY	Is Carrie Bradshaw an optimist or pessimist?
LILY	"yeah, What's your point of view? After the break-ups and disappointments and train wrecks."
LILY	"You still believe he's out there, right?"
COURTNEY	Or should we shoot ourselves now?
CARRIE	"No, Yes, Hopeful"
CARRIE	"To be honest, I wasn't sure what I believed."
CARRIE	But my cynical side suspected optimism would sell more books.
SAMANTHA	My best friend is going to be a published author.
SAMANTHA	"It's so fabulous, it makes me more fabulous."
CARRIE	I enjoy being under the radar.
CARRIE	"I take comfort in the fact that many people, present company included, don't see my column."
SAMANTHA	I'm waiting till it's in hardback.
SAMANTHA	I hope it's big and glossy.
CARRIE	Like my mistakes.
CARRIE	Is this something you encourage?
SAMANTHA	Do it! Newspaper is out.
SAMANTHA	It's all about books.
SAMANTHA	Everyone who's anyone has a book.
CARRIE	I'm not sure what you just said because I was blinded by a piece of jewellery.
CARRIE	Let me see that!
SAMANTHA	"It's from Richard. I think it's his way of saying, ""I'm sorry."
CARRIE	"Wow What do you get if it happens again, the Hope diamond? That's what this is."
SAMANTHA	"The ""hope that fucker doesn't break my heart again"" diamond."
CARRIE	evidently We were both turning our pain into gold.
CARRIE	"That night, I started to think about belief."
CARRIE	Maybe it's not advisable to be an optimist after the age of 30.
CARRIE	"Maybe pessimism is something we have to apply daily, like moisturiser."
CARRIE	"Otherwise, how do you bounce back when reality batters your belief system and love does not, as promised, conquer all."
CARRIE	"Is hope a drug we need to go off of, or is it keeping us alive? What's the harm in believing? Repeat your affirmations daily if you want to let love into your life."
AUDIO CASETTE	Open yourself.
AUDIO CASETTE	Breathe in the possibility of love.
AUDIO CASETTE	What is not love is fear.
AUDIO CASETTE	Let go of your fears and embrace your dreams.
CARRIE	"Miranda wasn't a believer, but her faith was renewed when she found a church that seemed to suit her and a suit that seemed to fit her."
IRANDA	I'm waiting in the rain.
STEVE	I know.
STEVE	You said 10:45.
IRANDA	Yeah!
ARY	It's my fault! I'm sorry.
ARY	He's not with her.
STEVE	I told you she'd probably leave him with the nurse.
STEVE	this is my ma.
STEVE	"Ma, Miranda."
IRANDA	"Mrs Brady, So Nice to meet you."
ARY	"No, Mary, please."
ARY	You're so fancy.
ARY	I wanted to wear my nice dress.
ARY	But the dry cleaners doesn't open until 10:00.
ARY	"I was hoping that you'd bring Brady, since I haven't seen him yet."
ARY	"Well, Stevie gave me a picture I've been carrying around in my wallet."
ARY	It's a little creased.
ARY	I should've put it in a frame.
ARY	"I Xeroxed it at the phone company, and everyone in my division said he looks like me."
ARY	I'll see him at the ceremony.
ARY	"I'm grateful to be included, especially since you aren't Catholic and didn't want to have a christening."
ARY	But the idea of this baby burning in hell
STEVE	Ma!
ARY	alright alright
ARY	"I'm just saying my oldest son, Jackie, had a baby who died, two weeks old."
ARY	We're still reeling.
ARY	His wife is black.
ARY	She's not very friendly.
ARY	"Thinks I have a problem with her, but I don't."
ARY	I don't.
ARY	Maybe the priest doesn't need to know you aren't getting married.
STEVE	We're not lying to the priest.
ARY	Now you're religious.
FATHER ANDREW	Hello.
FATHER ANDREW	are You the Hobbes party?
ARY	"Yes, we spoke on the phone."
FATHER ANDREW	I'm Father Andrew.
FATHER ANDREW	Come in.
IRANDA	Sorry we're late.
ARY	"Hello, Father."
ARY	I'm Mary Brady.
ARY	I go to Saint Agnes in Queens.
ARY	They're not getting married.
IRANDA	Is she drunk? -
STEVE	"No, just a couple of beers."
IRANDA	I don't want the baby referred to as Catholic.
IRANDA	No original sin.
IRANDA	No renouncing of Satan.
STEVE	It's not that she's a fan of Satan.
STEVE	She doesn't want to talk about him.
IRANDA	"In fact no mention of Satan, the devil"
CARRIE	"Miranda was surprised the priest was so flexible, but in troubled times, the Catholic Church is like a desperate, willing to settle for anything it can get."
CARRIE	This is not what I had in mind when you asked to go dress shopping.
IRANDA	I'm less thrilled than you.
IRANDA	He has to get baptised and wear a dress.
CARRIE	Baby's first drag show.
CARRIE	It's a very odd tradition.
IRANDA	Don't get me started.
IRANDA	It's about cleansing this little baby of his sins.
IRANDA	Babies come into this world with a clean slate.
IRANDA	We fuck them up.
CARRIE	"You're a pessimist, right?"
IRANDA	have we met?
CARRIE	It's for my book
CARRIE	I have to figure out if I'm an optimist or a pessimist.
CARRIE	I don't know any more.
CARRIE	I don't know what I believe.
IRANDA	Neither do I.
IRANDA	I'm having a baptism.
CARRIE	how do You rationalise that?
IRANDA	One less bath i have to give him?
IRANDA	I'm doing it for Steve.
IRANDA	He's been good to me.
IRANDA	I've known him three years.
IRANDA	I didn't meet his mother till yesterday.
CARRIE	What's she like?
IRANDA	"Imagine Steve, in a wig, drunk."
CARRIE	Yikes!
IRANDA	Yeah.
IRANDA	"So listen, How would you feel about being Brady's godmother?"
CARRIE	Really? What would I need to do?
IRANDA	"Officially, you provide the baby with spiritual guidance.Unofficially, you stand with me so I have somebody to roll my eyes at. What do you say?"
CARRIE	I don't know spiritual guidance?
IRANDA	And there's cake from some bakery in queens.
CARRIE	the sugary kind with the thick icing?
IRANDA	Maybe even a buttercream cross.
CARRIE	"Oh, now you're talking."
CARRIE	Spirituality and cake.
CARRIE	"That night, Charlotte dragged me to the fountain of belief."
CARRIE	It was mostly women.
CARRIE	"Apparently, women are the main market for hope."
CONFERENCE WELCOMER	Would you like an affirmation?
CARRIE	Saying no would get us off on the wrong foot.
CHARLOTTE	Thanks.
CONFERENCE WELCOMER	Enjoy.
CHARLOTTE	"""I believe in the good in people."
CHARLOTTE	""" That's nice. What does yours say?"
CARRIE	"""I believe this is hooey."
CHARLOTTE	""" Are you going to make fun of everything?"
CARRIE	"No, I'm not that quick."
CHARLOTTE	What did You do today?
CARRIE	"Oh, the usual."
CARRIE	Helped pick a christening gown for my friend's illegitimate baby.
IRANDA	"Oh, I'm so happy she decided to do a baptism."
CARRIE	she asked me to be the godmother.
CHARLOTTE	what?
CARRIE	It's not a big deal
CARRIE	It is a big deal!
CHARLOTTE	It's a huge responsibility.
CHARLOTTE	I know friendships that ended because someone was a disappointing godparent.
CARRIE	Why are you so?
CARRIE	did You want to be the godmother?
CHARLOTTE	No! It wouldn't kill you to acknowledge that some things are sacred.
CARRIE	I do
CHARLOTTE	We're not talking.
CARRIE	We're not?
CHARLOTTE	No
CARRIE	Are we talking yet? Let me know when we're talking.
CARRIE	I believe this is going to be a very long evening.
CARRIE	I believe we are the only normal people here.
CARRIE	"I believe in the good in Charlotte, who dragged me here against my will when I wanted to stay home and just be negative."
CHARLOTTE	What does the gown look like?
SAMANTHA	Table for two
RICHARD	"You're trying to make me feel bad, but that turns me on."
HOSTESS	Right this way.
SAMANTHA	Thank you.
RICHARD	are we OK?
SAMANTHA	We're fine.
SAMANTHA	I almost forgot.
SAMANTHA	You're going to Miranda's baptism with me Sunday.
SAMANTHA	"It'll be all day, it'll be boring, it'll be mandatory."
RICHARD	What time?
SAMANTHA	0.0833333333333333
RICHARD	are You going to do the thing again?
SAMANTHA	No
RICHARD	Are you?
RICHARD	"Samantha, I love you."
CARRIE	"Although he appeared to have reformed, Samantha wasn't ready to forgive his sin."
DR. GRAYSON	Love will come to you only when you truly believe you deserve it.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, an hour and 20 affirmations later"
DR. GRAYSON	"Love will raise you up, Fear will pull you under"
DR. GRAYSON	Only love is real.
DR. GRAYSON	"Yes, stand up."
AUDIENCE MEMBER	I wanted to thank you.
AUDIENCE MEMBER	The affirmations have really worked for me.
AUDIENCE MEMBER	"I prayed for love, I believed in love, and last week I fell in love."
AUDIENCE MEMBER	"He's perfect and kind and giving, and I now know that I deserve that."
AUDIENCE MEMBER	Thank you.
DR. GRAYSON	Thank yourself.
DR. GRAYSON	You did it.
DR. GRAYSON	Isn't that inspiring? Yeah.
DR. GRAYSON	Anyone else? -
DR. GRAYSON	did You want to say something?
CARRIE	"Oh, no"
CHARLOTTE	"Yes, Hi"
CHARLOTTE	I was wondering Hi I'm wondering how long that woman was doing her affirmations.
CHARLOTTE	I've been doing mine every day.
CHARLOTTE	"I want to believe, but nothing is happening."
CHARLOTTE	I just don't think it's working.
CHARLOTTE	I don't think it will work for me.
DR. GRAYSON	I hear fear.
DR. GRAYSON	I hear doubt.
DR. GRAYSON	You have to believe love to receive love.
DR. GRAYSON	Keep repeating your affirmations.
DR. GRAYSON	Your heart will catch up with your head.
CHARLOTTE	"That's the thing, though."
CHARLOTTE	I did find love.
CHARLOTTE	I believed there was someone out there for me and I met him finally.
CHARLOTTE	"We had a beautiful wedding, and then everything just fell apart."
CHARLOTTE	I'm worried.
CHARLOTTE	I'm afraid that he took away my ability to believe.
CHARLOTTE	I hate him for that because I always believed before.
CHARLOTTE	And now I just feel lost.
CHARLOTTE	"And I am, I'm trying to put myself out there but I feel hopeless."
DR. GRAYSON	Perhaps you're not really putting yourself out there.
CARRIE	"Oh No, she's out there."
DR. GRAYSON	I mean emotionally and physically.
DR. GRAYSON	Maybe you're not looking for love in a real way.
DR. GRAYSON	Maybe you're not really trying.
DR. GRAYSON	Maybe you're not really out there.
CARRIE	Believe me.
CARRIE	She's out there.
CARRIE	"Sunday afternoon, we gathered for a baptism in the little church that would."
PATRICK	"Hey, you, with the flower thing."
PATRICK	Steve tells me you're the godmother.
CARRIE	"oh, uh huh"
PATRICK	"I'm the godfather, Steve's second cousin, Patrick."
PATRICK	Make a good story? -
PATRICK	Little Brady brought us together.
IRANDA	"Oh Someone who isn't related to Steve, no offense."
PATRICK	None taken.
CARRIE	Hey.
PATRICK	"I'll check you later, 'gator."
CARRIE	oK.
IRANDA	It's a nice dress.
CARRIE	I didn't want Brady to show me up.
CARRIE	I think your baby's godfather baptised himself with some bad cologne.
IRANDA	Brady's grandmother invited the folks from Molly McGuire's.
CARRIE	I know your hands are full with the drunk and the skunk.
CARRIE	I have to Tell You something.
IRANDA	I'm too fat to be wearing this aren't I?
CARRIE	"No, oh no, you look beautiful."
CARRIE	It's me.
CARRIE	Are you sure that I am godmother material? Shouldn't you pick someone a bit more maternal?
IRANDA	"No, I like that you're not."
CARRIE	"Well, here's the thing."
CARRIE	This is an awesome responsibility.
CARRIE	I don't know my own view of the future.
CARRIE	I'm possibly one bad date away from bitter.
CARRIE	Don't you think I'm getting a little cynical?
IRANDA	Not compared to me.
IRANDA	You're my best friend.
CARRIE	"Charlotte's dying for the job, and I think she'd be better at it."
IRANDA	"I don't know if I believe in any of this, but I believe in you."
IRANDA	I want you to be my baby's godmother.
CARRIE	"Well, I did spring for the hat."
FATHER ANDREW	Who presents this child to receive the sacrament of Baptism?
IRANDO AND STEVE	We Do
FATHER ANDREW	"""Give him an enquiring and discerning heart, ""the courage to will and to persevere, a spirit to love, ""and the gift of joy and wonder."
AUDIENCE	"In the Lord's name, we pray."
FATHER ANDREW	"Lord, hear our prayer."
FATHER ANDREW	"""In baptism we use your gift of water, ""which you have made a rich symbol ""of the grace you give us in this sacrament."
FATHER ANDREW	"""Through it, you led the children of Israel out of their bondage."
FATHER ANDREW	"""Through it, we are reborn."
SAMANTHA	There isn't enough holy water in the world to cleanse you.
FATHER ANDREW	"Brady, I baptise you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit."
FATHER ANDREW	Amen.
CARRIE	I hoped the water would wash away some of my original cynicism.
ARY	"Isn't this the most beautiful goddamn Catholic you've ever seen? Sorry, Father."
ARY	But he's a cute fucking kid.
SAMANTHA	"honey, Congratulations."
IRANDA	I didn't do anything.
SAMANTHA	You got me to a church.
RICHARD	Beautiful baby.
IRANDA	Thank you.
RICHARD	"Just for the record, I did get scared."
IRANDA	"OK, whatever."
IRANDA	Thanks for coming.
IRANDA	He's such a player.
CHARLOTTE	I don't know.
CHARLOTTE	Maybe things will work out between them.
CARRIE	"That night, I dedicated my baby my book to hopeful single women everywhere, and one in particular my good friend Charlotte, the eternal optimist, who always believes in love."
CARRIE	"When venturing out on your first blind date in a decade, it's crucial to have the right attitude."
CARRIE	Hope for the best.
CARRIE	Ted?
RANDOM MAN	Sorry.
CARRIE	"Prepare for the worst and who knows, you might be pleasantly surprised."
CARRIE	Or not.
CARRIE	I got stood up.
CARRIE	"Yes, deigned to go on a blind date against my better judgment."
CARRIE	I was willing to lower myself into the gutter.
IRANDA	"god, I miss dating."
CARRIE	He doesn't show.
CHARLOTTE	Are you sure?
CARRIE	Either he didn't show or took one look at me and ran.
CARRIE	Which is worse? I can't decide.
CHARLOTTE	I'm sure we'll get to the botTom of this.
CARRIE	A stranger hurt my feelings.
CARRIE	That's scraping botTom.
SAMANTHA	You shouldn't be going on blind dates.
CHARLOTTE	That's not true.
CHARLOTTE	I know great couples that met on blind dates.
CHARLOTTE	Eric and Marcy
CARRIE	stop.
CARRIE	"Even if he had shown, first dates are like interviews with cocktails."
CARRIE	I'm done.
IRANDA	I said that yesterday about bread.
IRANDA	I ordered pancakes.
CARRIE	"Why should I risk having a god-awful evening, when I am guaranteed to have fun with you guys?"
SAMANTHA	"Honey, you're cute, but I'm never gonna fuck you."
CHARLOTTE	I'm sorry this happened on your first date back.
CHARLOTTE	Keep trying.
CARRIE	"I came out, I saw my shadow."
CARRIE	I'm going back in.
CARRIE	See you next winter.
CHARLOTTE	You have to take risks so you don't wind up an old maid.
CARRIE	Oh! That's right.
CARRIE	Must not wind up old maid.
CARRIE	How will I remember that?
CARRIE	Does anybody have a pen?
IRANDA	"Why do we get ""old maid"" and ""spinster"" and men are ""bachelors"" and ""playboys""?"
SAMANTHA	No matter how shrivelled their dicks are.
CARRIE	The end.
CARRIE	New topic.
CARRIE	Charlotte's 36th birthday is Saturday night.
CARRIE	I say we spinsters take back Manhattan.
CHARLOTTE	I've thought about it and I've decided I'm sticking at 35.
IRANDA	It was such a good year?
CHARLOTTE	I'm not where I thought I'd be at 36.
CHARLOTTE	I don't feel 36.
CHARLOTTE	"I don't look 36, right?"
CARRIE	No
CHARLOTTE	Men are more interested in meeting
IRANDA	We all turned 36 like big girls. Now it's your turn.
SAMANTHA	Lying about her age is the smartest thing she's done in years.
CARRIE	"Where are we celebrating Charlotte's 35th birthday, the sequel?"
IRANDA	Today is the baby nurse's last day.
IRANDA	"Now, you have to book me in advance."
CARRIE	You're like Nobu.
SAMANTHA	I can't go either.
SAMANTHA	Richard's taking me to Atlantic City.
IRANDA	What'd you do wrong?
SAMANTHA	he loves to gamble.
SAMANTHA	There's a heavyweight fight he wants to see.
SAMANTHA	We are going on his private jet.
CHARLOTTE	No celebration is fine with me.
CARRIE	The four of us can't get together for Charlotte's 30-faux birthday?
CARRIE	"This is bullshit! Two nights later, with no friends, no dates, not even any good bad TV to watch This is bullshit."
CARRIE	"OK, this is my third and final phone call."
CARRIE	Miranda thinks she can get Steve to watch the baby.
CARRIE	Charlotte agreed as long as we don't mention her birthday or 36.
CARRIE	I'm still a little fuzzy on the rules.
CARRIE	Can't you get out of Atlantic City?
SAMANTHA	I'll have to ask Richard.
CARRIE	Please do.
CARRIE	I am looking at the last picture taken of us and it is mouldy.
CARRIE	Miranda is wearing a blouse with shoulder pads.
SAMANTHA	Carrie's hell-bent on getting the four of us together Saturday.
SAMANTHA	Would you be terribly disappointed if I didn't come?
RICHARD	Why not bring them?
RICHARD	I'll raise two suites.
RICHARD	There's room on the jet.
CARRIE	
CARRIE	Under the boardwalk We'll be having What?
IRANDA	I can't go
IRANDA	I'm not ready to be separated from the baby.
CARRIE	what?
IRANDA	I'm kidding! Steve took him two hours ago.
IRANDA	I'm free! I'm leaving the compound!
CARRIE	Don't do that to me! I'm a 36-year-old woman! Come on in.
IRANDA	I need two seconds.
IRANDA	two seconds.
CARRIE	oK.
CARRIE	"Oh, man Hi, Magda."
CARRIE	How are you?
AGDA	You want to see something beautiful? I show you.
AGDA	Look at him.
AGDA	You ever see such beautiful face? Look here.
AGDA	So smiley.
AGDA	"And here, after bath."
AGDA	With his little poopick.
AGDA	OK.
CARRIE	"As I live and breathe, Ms Hobbes, I never thought I'd see the day."
IRANDA	"That's not me, that's her."
IRANDA	I didn't take most of those.
IRANDA	This is my only sweater that covers my ass.
IRANDA	Can I get away with this and stretchy pants?
CARRIE	Atlantic City is the capital of stretchy pants.
CARRIE	They're mandatory.
CARRIE	Let's go.
CARRIE	Let's go.
STEVE	Hi.
STEVE	How you doing?
IRANDA	What's wrong? Why are you back?
STEVE	"I thought I forgot the Wipies, but turns out actually"
STEVE	I don't think I can do this.
IRANDA	Excuse me?
STEVE	I'm afraid that I might break him.
STEVE	I accidentally scratched his face with my dirty fingernail.
IRANDA	It's nothing.
IRANDA	You've taken care of him before.
IRANDA	It's been fine.
STEVE	"Yeah, but for two hours I'm great."
STEVE	"After two hours, I might accidentally kill him."
IRANDA	We're both afraid we're going to kill the baby.
IRANDA	We made an agreement this week.
IRANDA	"Monday to Friday, I try not to kill him."
IRANDA	"Saturday and Sunday, you try not to."
STEVE	I'm sorry.
STEVE	I can't do it.
IRANDA	You should go.
IRANDA	You're gonna miss the plane.
CARRIE	The four of us are going to Atlantic City.
IRANDA	We will figure something out.
CHARLOTTE	Hello! Sorry I'm so late.

CHARLOTTE	"Ooh, it's pretty But what is it? I'm sorry."
RICHARD	That was actually meant for Samantha.
RICHARD	a Pearl thong.
RICHARD	for me? You naughty boy.
CHARLOTTE	Did I tell you I've taken up knitting? It calms my nerves.
CHARLOTTE	Practical and stimulating.
SAMANTHA	What will they think of next?
CHARLOTTE	"Knitting is the new yoga, according to ""New York Magazine""."
CHARLOTTE	I'm making these for Brady.
RICHARD	"Maybe later, I'll give you a pearl necklace to match."
CHARLOTTE	My father gave me a beautiful pearl necklace for my sweet sixteen.
SAMANTHA	We're talking about the other kind of pearl necklace.
SAMANTHA	"You know, when a guy decorates your neck?"
CHARLOTTE	You're sure that Carrie said they were coming down tonight?
CARRIE	"""Knit one, purl two"" would never sound the same to Charlotte again."
IRANDA	I need to go somewhere that I've been looking forward to
CARRIE	Excuse me.
IRANDA	"No, No time out, guys."
CARRIE	Magda has offered to help Steve.
IRANDA	That's not her job.
CARRIE	Throw some money at the problem.

CARRIE	"What do you mean, ""sure""? I could barely get us together for the weekend and we're all mobile."
CARRIE	"Hey ""New Yorker"", I'm talking to you."
CARRIE	How are we gonna make it to 70 if you've already zoned me out?
IRANDA	I'm listening.
IRANDA	Talk fast.
CARRIE	Friendships don't magically last It's like savings.
CARRIE	You don't expect to wake up when you're old and find a big bucket of money.
IRANDA	did You finally open That IRA?
CARRIE	no.
CARRIE	"My point is, we need an emotional retirement plan."
CARRIE	"This is important, making time for each other and taking trips like this."
CARRIE	"As we can see, at the end of the line, it's gonna be us ladies riding a bus."
IRANDA	I'm so happy right now.

SAMANTHA	A little harmless over-the-bra action and Miss Prissy here is running for a parachute.
CHARLOTTE	Have you heard of a pearl necklace?
IRANDA	I'm hitting the slots.
SAMANTHA	I told Richard I'd stop by.
CARRIE	Not so fast.

IRANDA	That reminds me.
IRANDA	I have to pump.
SAMANTHA	"Who picked this ""breastaurant""?"

IRANDA	I've got pay-per-view and a frozen Milky Way in my room.
CARRIE	What? A minute ago you were bouncing off the walls.

TV	Roulette is no exception.
TV	"The house edge on all bets is 119, for 5 points Except for zero, double zero, which Carries a house edge of-"
CARRIE	"People go to casinos for the same reason they go on blind dates hoping to hit the jackpot.But mostly, you wind up broke or alone in a bar."
CARRIE	"If we know the house always wins, why gamble? Next morning, Richard and Samantha awoke in the Kublai Khan suite."
RICHARD	How long will you be with the girls?
SAMANTHA	"All day, probably."
SAMANTHA	What are your plans?
SAMANTHA	I haven't decided yet.

RICHARD	"not a problem, Terry."
CARRIE	"Apparently, there were no old maids at the Taj Mahal."
SAMANTHA	"Terry, was it? Easy to remember."
SAMANTHA	Terry with her terry cloth towels.
CARRIE	Samantha had the distinct feeling she was being Kublai conned.
SAMANTHA	Thank you.
RICHARD	"You're not jealous of a casino cleaning lady, are you?"
SAMANTHA	It's impressive you know the name of every woman who works here.
RICHARD	I know the male employee's names.
RICHARD	Doesn't mean I'll sleep with them.
RICHARD	Aren't you keeping the girls?
SAMANTHA	"hi, I'm Samantha."
SAMANTHA	"Can I get you some towels, a chocolate for your pillow? A blow job."
RICHARD	"Yes, But not necessarily in That order."
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, Charlotte's encore There she was, an old maid."
CARRIE	And it wasn't funny.
CARRIE	"Three hours later, I was waiting for our foursome to come together."
IRANDA	Here's the spin.
CARRIE	You're quite the spinster.
SAMANTHA	Sorry I'm late.
SAMANTHA	I've been fucking Richard for three hours.
SAMANTHA	He's all fucked out.

IRANDA	"Charlotte, are You in there?"
CARRIE	"No, but I think ""Harlot"" is."
CHARLOTTE	"I didn't like what I packed, so I picked something at the casino shop."
CARRIE	Those are for women who have lost their money and have to turn tricks.
IRANDA	Does this gal gamble? -
CHARLOTTE	Yeah!
SAMANTHA	No wonder the house always wins.These guys are smothered in breasts.
SAMANTHA	What was I thinking bringing a cheating man to Atlantic Titty.
CARRIE	What You doing down there?
SAMANTHA	It's the pearl thong.
SAMANTHA	It's good for foreplay.
SAMANTHA	Not good for post-play.
CARRIE	You bet It all?
IRANDA	You've gotta play big to win big.
CASINO PERSON	"Ma'am, would you like a hit?"
CASINO PERSON	Over.
IRANDA	"Well, we Just lost Big."

JERK ONE	It's not Disneyland.
IRANDA	"Hey, Red, move your fat ass!"
CARRIE	What did You Just say to her?
SAMANTHA	Who the hell do you think you are?
JERK ONE	Fuck you! -
JERK TWO	Get in the game or get out.
IRANDA	"Guys, let's go."
IRANDA	It's OK.
CARRIE	No! It is most certainly not OK!
CHARLOTTE	"Listen, you big jerk! Her ass isn't normally this big."
IRANDA	"Thank you, I almost forgot."
IRANDA	"My ass is fat because I just had a baby, you asshole."
SAMANTHA	What's your excuse?
CARRIE	"You having triplets? Come on, let's go."
CARRIE	"The Lennox Lewis match sold out that night, but our heavyweight fight caused a bigger stir."
IRANDA	I think I'm gonna go upstairs.
CARRIE	They're just idiots.
CARRIE	Don't go.
IRANDA	I'm tired.
IRANDA	"I'm sorry, Charlotte."
IRANDA	Happy birthday.
CARRIE	Stay.

SAMANTHA	He had a sudden conference call and he can't go to the fight.
SAMANTHA	"""Go with the girls."
SAMANTHA	""" Right."
SAMANTHA	So he can get serviced by room service.
SAMANTHA	We'll see about that.
SAMANTHA	Shit!
CARRIE	"Under other circumstances, running stairs in a pearl thong would have been Samantha's idea of a good time."
CARRIE	"By the eighth floor, somewhere between pissed off and getting off, she had to take it off."
RICHARD	"Yes, thank you."
RICHARD	I will.
SAMANTHA	No one's here.
SAMANTHA	No one's here.
RICHARD	What's going on?
SAMANTHA	I can't do this any more. That's what's going on.
SAMANTHA	I ran up 11 flights of stairs because I was sure you were fucking someone.
RICHARD	"As you can see, I'm not."
SAMANTHA	Right now.
SAMANTHA	Right now you're not.
SAMANTHA	But you were and you will again.
SAMANTHA	I can't spend my life running up and down stairs wondering when.
SAMANTHA	"I thought I could handle this, but I can't."
SAMANTHA	I'm too old.
SAMANTHA	"I'm 37, after all."
RICHARD	"I told you I'd do my best never to hurt you again, and I meant it."
SAMANTHA	"Right, your best."
RICHARD	Samantha I love you.
SAMANTHA	"I love you too, Richard, but I love me more."
CARRIE	"And there, high above the casino, Samantha pulled her highest bet, her heart, off the table."
CARRIE	Just when Samantha thought she might have folded too soon
CARRIE	"One drink here, then we should see the boardwalk before it's dark."

CARRIE	I don't want to.
CARRIE	I would rather have a real conversation with you.
CHARLOTTE	Can't we have one drink? It might be fun.
ROB	Let's go.
CHARLOTTE	They're gone.
CARRIE	"Well, problem solved."
CARRIE	out of the dark and into the light.
CARRIE	Isn't this amazing? It's like a postcard from the '20s.
CHARLOTTE	What's the harm in one drink?

CHARLOTTE	we might have hit It off.
CARRIE	come on.
CARRIE	Look at the odds.
CARRIE	How many guys do we ever hit it off with?
CARRIE	"Very few, and even if we do, those relationships don't last."
CARRIE	"Even if they did, men die first."
CARRIE	We're back where we started.
CARRIE	I say we skip all the drama and enjoy each other's company now.
CHARLOTTE	But I don't want to skip all the drama.
CHARLOTTE	That's life.
CHARLOTTE	That's everything.
CHARLOTTE	That's relationships and anniversaries and kids.
CHARLOTTE	"I want all that, in addition to my friends."
CARRIE	"That sounds wonderful, but don't bank on it happening."
CARRIE	You must be getting cold.
CARRIE	I'll meet you back at the hotel.
CARRIE	I'm going to get some saltwater taffy.
CHARLOTTE	are You sure?
CARRIE	I'm dying for it.
LOUD SPEAKER	"Watch the tramcar, please."
CARRIE	"By my fifth piece of peppermint taffy, I realised maybe I wasn't banking on my friends."
CARRIE	I was hiding in them.
OLD MAN ON BENCH	Ready for a swim? Got your bathing suit on under there.
OLD WOMAN ON BENCH	"Oh yeah, it's a bikini."
OLD WOMAN ON BENCH	You'll love it.
OLD MEN ON BENCH	I was hoping for a skinny dip.
OLD WOMAN ON BENCH	There is nothing skinny about either of us.
OLD WOMAN ON BENCH	Should we go back?
OLD MAN ON BENCH	in a minute.
OLD MAN ON BENCH	It's almost sunset.
OLD WOMAN ON BENCH	You and your pink sky.
CARRIE	"Then again, maybe there are some things worth gambling on."
CARRIE	"Back inside, I had a thought."
CARRIE	"To hit the jackpot in the future, you might have to bet on where you are in the present."
CASINO PERSON	"Ladies and gentlemen, place your bets."
CARRIE	What happens after 36?
CASINO PERSON	I don't know.
CASINO PERSON	I guess you fall off the table.
CASINO PERSON	"All right, no more bets."
CASINO PERSON	Here we go.
CASINO PERSON	The winner is number 29.
IRANDA	Well I can't believe you gambled all that money.
IRANDA	We could be in a limo.
CARRIE	You told me to.
CARRIE	I thought we were taking the jet.
CARRIE	You couldn't have broken up Tomorrow?
SAMANTHA	And lose my dignity?
IRANDA	Don't let me have any more of these.
CHARLOTTE	Anyone up for playing Old Maid?
SAMANTHA	aren't we?
IRANDA	I'm in
CARRIE	I'm in.
CARRIE	"Oh, wait!"
IRANDA	oh my god!
SAMANTHA	no
CARRIE	Excuse me.
CARRIE	Would you mind taking our picture?
IRANDA	This is the moment we'll want to remember.
CARRIE	"Turns out, it was."
CARRIE	it is said that it takes a lifetime to figure out who you are.
COURTNEY	This book cover is so you.
CARRIE	People in publishing move a tad faster.
LILY	It's a mock-up.
LILY	Don't be thrown.
LILY	We put your head on another body.
COURTNEY	"The cover of ""Sex And The City""."
LILY	"The bestselling ""Sex And The City""."
CARRIE	No! I'm sorry.
CARRIE	That just came out.
COURTNEY	That's good.
COURTNEY	You had a strong reaction.
COURTNEY	That's what we want.
LILY	"We don't want the reaction to be ""no""."
COURTNEY	Let me talk you through it.
COURTNEY	Blurred background.
COURTNEY	A fast-paced city.
COURTNEY	You naked with nothing but your ideas.
CARRIE	I get it.
CARRIE	"But no matter how fast-paced the city, I always manage to get my clothes on before I leave the apartment."
CARRIE	"Courtney, here's what concerns me."
CARRIE	That cover is all about sex.
COURTNEY	"Well, sex sells."
CARRIE	Yes my columns are about relationships.
CARRIE	"When I write about sex, it's just words."
CARRIE	Reading about sex is different than seeing it in front of you naked on 6th Avenue hailing a cab.
LILY	"I totally understand, Carrie."
CARRIE	oK.
LILY	We're fucked.
CARRIE	No.
CARRIE	OK Let me see it again.
CARRIE	Absolutely not.
CARRIE	I would sooner die.
CARRIE	"The next day, our talk turned from bachelors, baby bottles and Balenciaga blouses to books."
CARRIE	"Bad, worse, loser disaster."
CARRIE	And you know the scary thing? I'm being kind.
SAMANTHA	Relax.
SAMANTHA	What could anyone say about you? You're fabulous.
CARRIE	"But if I get the wrong book cover, I'm a fabulous target."
CARRIE	People are mean.
SAMANTHA	People are not that mean.
SAMANTHA	She looks like shit.
SAMANTHA	Is her stylist blind?
CARRIE	I have officially entered panic.
SAMANTHA	"Oh, stop."
SAMANTHA	Talk to me.
SAMANTHA	This is what I do.
SAMANTHA	How do you see yourself on the cover?
CARRIE	"Like a writer who happened to have wound up on her book cover looking smart, sexy and properly airbrushed."
SAMANTHA	I can help you.
SAMANTHA	I'll talk to the publishers.
SAMANTHA	When's the photo shoot?
CARRIE	"Next Thursday, but I can't afford you."
SAMANTHA	"True, my PR services are pricey."
SAMANTHA	It'll cost you two martinis and a lunch.
CARRIE	"OK, I'll talk to my people."
CHARLOTTE	What kind of a diet book are you looking for?
IRANDA	"Something like ""How To Lose That Baby Fat By Sitting On Your Ass""."
CHARLOTTE	"How about ""The Zone""?"
IRANDA	how about No?
CHARLOTTE	I thought You were serious.
IRANDA	I am.
 MIRANDA	"As soon as I finish this nougat, caramel, pretzel thing."
CHARLOTTE	I'm gonna go look for this book I read about.
IRANDA	What's it called?
CHARLOTTE	"""Starting Over Yet Again""."
CHARLOTTE	See ya.
CARRIE	There it was.
CARRIE	The self hell aisle.
CARRIE	"As Charlotte looked at the titles: ""The Women's Comfort Book"", ""The Path To Love"", ""Excuse Me, Your Life Is Waiting"", ""Please Understand Me ll"", she couldn't bear the thought that she belonged there."
CRYING WOMAN	That really helped me.
CHARLOTTE	Travel? Travel? Travel?
BOOK SELLER	This is adorable.This is psychotic.
BOOK SELLER	"It's none of my business, but don't do that."
BOOK SELLER	I did.
BOOK SELLER	"I lost 24, gained 46."
IRANDA	"""The New York Times"" said-"
BOOK SELLER	"Can ""The New York Times"" pry the cookie dough out of your hands?"
BOOK SELLER	Weight Watchers.
BOOK SELLER	It's the only sane way.
BOOK SELLER	You can even have dessert.
IRANDA	"Where's ""Starting Over Yet Again""?"
BOOK SELLER	Here you go.
BOOK SELLER	good luck with Weight Watchers.
IRANDA	Thank you.
IRANDA	did You find your book?
CHARLOTTE	"No, it wasn't for me."
IRANDA	Yeah.
IRANDA	Like I need his advice.
CARRIE	I'm a dead woman.
CARRIE	"Who needs the self help aisle when you can self help yourself to amazon.com and get exactly what you need, overnight express and shame free."
SAMANTHA	That's quite a package.
JOE	Excuse me?
SAMANTHA	That's quite a package.
JOE	"Want to sign right here, please?"
SAMANTHA	There.How's that?
JOE	Pretty damn good.
SAMANTHA	I just got my nails done.
SAMANTHA	"Would you mind opening my package? Ooh, thank you."
SAMANTHA	"Now, maybe I can help you with your package."
JOE	Fucking 'A'.
CARRIE	"At exactly 12:15, I stopped by to pick up Samantha for our business lunch to decide what we thought was sexy."
CARRIE	"Oh, I'm sorry."
JOE	Wanna Keep going?
SAMANTHA	"No, I've had enough."
CARRIE	"Some women, like Samantha, know when to stop putting things in their mouths, while others, like Miranda, need a little help."
IRANDA	I'm much lighter metric.
IRANDA	Excuse me.
WEIGHT WATCHERS WOMEN	Hi.
IRANDA	There's been a mistake on my weight.
WEIGHT WATCHERS WOMEN	The scales don't lie.
IRANDA	This isn't a vanity thing.
IRANDA	The other woman inverted the numbers.
IRANDA	"If I'm gonna do this, I want to do it right."
WEIGHT WATCHERS WOMEN	You've got the right attitude.
WEIGHT WATCHERS WOMEN	Come on.
WEIGHT WATCHERS WOMEN	Can I scooch in a minute? Thanks.
WEIGHT WATCHERS WOMEN	Elaine.

TOM	Tom.
TOM	Big boned.
IRANDA	Miranda.
IRANDA	Baby weight.
TOM	Hi.
IRANDA	Hi.
CARRIE	"Later that same day, Stanford came over for a fag and some flipping."
CARRIE	"Finish that and get over here and start on ""Vogue""."
CARRIE	Tear out any outfit that might work for me.
CARRIE	Something that won't be too pathetic if I wind up in the half-off bin.
CARRIE	"Well, you look very something."
STANFORD	I am very something.
CARRIE	"What's going on, Ms Blatch?"
STANFORD	I met someone.
CARRIE	"Oh, my god."
CARRIE	Really? That's fantastic!
STANFORD	His name is Marcus.
CARRIE	is he a Roman?
STANFORD	"No, he is not."
CARRIE	Too bad.
CARRIE	I adore a metal breastplate on a man.
CARRIE	What does he do? OK.
STANFORD	"Before I tell you, you have to promise not to judge."
CARRIE	Do I judge? -
STANFORD	We all judge. That's our hobby.
STANFORD	Some people do arts and crafts.
STANFORD	We judge.
CARRIE	I'll be kind.
STANFORD	He's a dancer.
STANFORD	Radio City Music Hall.
CARRIE	I feel as though my hands are tied.
STANFORD	"He's a Broadway calibre dancer, working in the male chorus."
STANFORD	"Last Christmas, he danced the part of Arabian Coffee in ""The Nutcracker""."
CARRIE	where did You meet?
STANFORD	Standing in line at Starbucks.
CARRIE	You met a man who played coffee waiting to get coffee?
STANFORD	We're both grande house blends.
CARRIE	"What is That, a New zodiac sign?"
CARRIE	Hello.
SAMANTHA	how funny was That in my office? Hilarious.
CARRIE	I'm sending you the X-ray bill for my elbow.
SAMANTHA	Could You have gotten out Any faster?
CARRIE	no
SAMANTHA	Lighten up.
CARRIE	I am lightened up.
SAMANTHA	good news.
SAMANTHA	I got my favourite stylist to pull some looks for the cover.
CARRIE	Did you tell them what we're looking for?
SAMANTHA	"Sexy Chic, like You said."
CARRIE	when are You meeting them?
CARRIE	Maybe I should join you.
SAMANTHA	Don't worry.
SAMANTHA	I'll handle it.
CARRIE	But I have some ideas.
SAMANTHA	"You Still want me to do this, right?"
CARRIE	"Yeah, why wouldn't I?"
SAMANTHA	I'll have them pull some stuff.
SAMANTHA	How's Saturday?
CARRIE	It's great.
CARRIE	I'll ask Stanford to come.
SAMANTHA	is Stanford suddenly a stylist?
CARRIE	"No, but he's gay and bitchy."
CARRIE	My target test audience.
CARRIE	You OK?
SAMANTHA	I'm fabulous.
SAMANTHA	We'll talk Tomorrow.
CARRIE	oK.
STANFORD	Ask Stanford to come Where?
CARRIE	Look at some outfits for the cover.
CARRIE	Saturday.
STANFORD	I'll have to check with Marcus.
STANFORD	We may have plans.
CARRIE	"You're not gonna turn into one of those couples, are you?"
STANFORD	Judgey wudgey was a bear
CARRIE	"I think it's pretty much agreed that it goes open-minded: good, judgmental: bad. But are we being too quick to judge judgment? Perhaps judgment is not so much a snap decision as an early warning and detection device."
CARRIE	"If it is instantly clear that a person, place or profession is not for you, is it better to ignore your better judgment and read between the lines or should you judge a book by its cover? You've got mail."
CHARLOTTE	"""Based on your recent book purchase, ""here's a list of books you might be interested in."
CARRIE	""" The selected list included ""Lonely Women No Men"", ""Love Hurts."
CARRIE	"You Don't Have To"", ""I'm Fine Now"" and ""Reservations for One""."
CARRIE	Charlotte refused to see herself as one of those women.
CARRIE	It fell eight flights and landed at the feet of a woman contemplating divorce.
CARRIE	She considered it a sign from God.
CARRIE	"After three Weight Watchers meetings, where they did nothing but talk about eating, Miranda Baby Weight and Tom Big Boned went someplace to eat."
TOM	"Then I did the one where you only have water, eggs and grapefruit."
IRANDA	Cos they're so good together.
TOM	Yes.
TOM	It worked out well until I fainted on an Indian woman in the subway.
IRANDA	"What about the one with the pre-packaged, chemicalised food?"
TOM	How do they get all of those artificial ingredients into such tiny packages?
IRANDA	Although they did have this itty-bitty thing of tuna that I loved.
IRANDA	I cut my tongue licking it out of the can and knew it was time to stop.
TOM	ever try the cabbage soup diet?
IRANDA	"No, I heard It gives You bad"
TOM	Gas? it's true.
TOM	That was the end of my fiancÃ©e.
IRANDA	She sounds mean.
TOM	There was more to it.
TOM	We weren't good together.
TOM	She was very critical.
TOM	"The more she put me down, the more I ate."
TOM	"Whenever somebody criticises me, I go right for those."
IRANDA	Glazed.
IRANDA	They're my favourite.
TOM	The best Weight Watchers meeting is on 23rd Street.
TOM	Can't go near it cos there's a Krispy Kreme next door.
IRANDA	How many Weight Watchers points do you think is in one of those?
TOM	Two hundred thousand.
IRANDA	Would it be terrible if we split one?
TOM	We're consenting adults.
TOM	Sir? Can I get a Krispy Kreme and a knife?
SERVER	Here you go.
IRANDA	Whoever invented glaze is a genius.
IRANDA	"See, that is worth being fat for."
IRANDA	"I'm sorry, it's worth it."
CARRIE	I know how we can burn this off.
IRANDA	Really?
TOM	Activity points.
CARRIE	Weight Watchers turned out to be a lot more enjoyable than Miranda expected.
CARRIE	no.
IRANDA	Yes. I was All over his face.
CARRIE	no
IRANDA	yes
SAMANTHA	talk about loving yourself.
IRANDA	I'd rather be good friends with myself.
SAMANTHA	when I was a lesbian
CARRIE	I saw that coming.
SAMANTHA	I could get out with nothing more than a fine lip gloss.
CARRIE	You're awfully quiet.
CHARLOTTE	What is There to say? the man has bad manners.
CHARLOTTE	You keep a box of tissues on the nightstand.
CHARLOTTE	"While he's stroking you with one hand, he grabs a tissue and dabs his face."
SAMANTHA	Emily Post's Polite Pussy.
SAMANTHA	Why didn't you just say something?
IRANDA	It's hard to criticise if you're with someone who overeats when criticised.
CARRIE	Miranda went out with an overeater and he overate her.
IRANDA	"When he popped his head up, he had such a proud look on his face."
SAMANTHA	"They always look proud, like they just came back from war."
SAMANTHA	"They want that ""you're my hero"" kiss."
CHARLOTTE	not without a tissue and an Altoid.
IRANDA	It's a double standard.
IRANDA	I'd feel insulted if I'd gone down on a guy and he wouldn't kiss me.
SAMANTHA	"Samantha, do you kiss after a blow job?"
CARRIE	"No, she signs the delivery slip and sends him on his way."
CHARLOTTE	What's going on?
SAMANTHA	Carrie has a problem that she saw me blowing the Worldwide Express guy.
CHARLOTTE	Oh.
CARRIE	That was her and not me.
CARRIE	when did I say I had a problem?
SAMANTHA	"You walked in, caught us and ran."
CARRIE	"What was I supposed to do? Flip through ""Marie Claire""?"
IRANDA	Where did you see her blowing him? Not on the street
SAMANTHA	Of course not.
SAMANTHA	It was in the privacy of my office.
SAMANTHA	It wasn't a Worldwide Express guy.
SAMANTHA	It was my Worldwide Express guy.
CARRIE	your Worldwide Express Guy?
SAMANTHA	Yes.
CHARLOTTE	What's his name?
SAMANTHA	Joe.Tuesdays and Thursdays.
IRANDA	What's the big deal? We laugh about this kind of stuff all the time.
SAMANTHA	Fine.
CHARLOTTE	Samantha
SAMANTHA	"It's fine. We'd better go, Carrie."
SAMANTHA	We'll be late for the stylist.
SAMANTHA	"naughty, fabulous, camp."
SAMANTHA	Harlot.
CARRIE	no.
SAMANTHA	"I think it's a fantastic approach, and the publishers love the idea."
CARRIE	They wanted me buck-naked waiting for the M11 bus.
CARRIE	We said sexy chic.
CARRIE	"Who is this stylist, Frederick's of Hollywood?"
SAMANTHA	Just go try at least one on.
CARRIE	I can't wear this.
CARRIE	"I'm gonna look like an extra from ""Moulin Rouge""."
SAMANTHA	You will not.
SAMANTHA	The shoes are lined up in there.
SAMANTHA	Scoot.
CARRIE	Don't say scoot.
STANFORD	Knock knock.
STANFORD	Nothing in here I haven't seen and ruled out in junior high.
SAMANTHA	"Hello, doll."
SAMANTHA	Carrie's changing.
STANFORD	"Samantha this is my Boyfriend, Marcus."
SAMANTHA	Papa's got himself a brand new bag.
STANFORD	Come out.
STANFORD	I want to introduce you.
STANFORD	"Marcus Adent, Lady Marmalade."
CARRIE	Nice to meet you.
CARRIE	I don't usually dress like a high-class hooker.
SAMANTHA	That is not a hooker Look.
CARRIE	"Please, this screams hooker."
CARRIE	What respectable New York woman would be caught dead wearing this? I
SAMANTHA	I have one in red. Am I a hooker?
CARRIE	Could you wait outside? We're having trouble deciding on my outfit.
SAMANTHA	"No, let's get a second, and I might add gay, opinion."
SAMANTHA	Doesn't she look adorable in that?
STANFORD	Yes.
CARRIE	Isn't this the worst possible outfit for my cover?
STANFORD	yes
SAMANTHA	What about you? What do you think?
ARCUS	It's not very modern.
STANFORD	Isn't he great? He's great.
CARRIE	Can you wait outside for a second?
STANFORD	What do you think?
CARRIE	great
CARRIE	"Samantha, I really appreciate the help."
CARRIE	You and I have different ideas about what's sexy.
SAMANTHA	"This is about the blow job, isn't it?"
CARRIE	what
SAMANTHA	One blow job and I'm a hooker with no taste.
CARRIE	This isn't about the blow job.
CARRIE	This is about the book cover.
CARRIE	I don't feel comfortable on a shelf next to a biography of Eleanor Roosevelt with my breasts hanging out.
SAMANTHA	What is the problem? I've seen you wearing not much else.
CARRIE	Not lately.
CARRIE	You know why? It's time for ladies my age to cover it up.
CARRIE	We can't get away with what we used to.
SAMANTHA	Meaning blow jobs.
CARRIE	
CARRIE	What is your problem?
SAMANTHA	I don't have a problem.
CARRIE	You do.
CARRIE	I have marabou-covered breasts.
CARRIE	That is my only problem.
SAMANTHA	I'm not blind.
SAMANTHA	I saw that look in your eye in my office.
CARRIE	What look?
SAMANTHA	That judgmental look.
CARRIE	That was shock.
CARRIE	I thought we were having lunch.
SAMANTHA	Do you have no judgment about me and the Worldwide Express guy?
CARRIE	No judgment.
CARRIE	I do have a question.
CARRIE	"Will this relationship be priority overnight or next day delivery? Oh, come on."
CARRIE	"Lighten up, remember?"
SAMANTHA	If I walked in on you giving a blow job to a Worldwide Express guy
CARRIE	You wouldn't because that is something I would never do.
SAMANTHA	There.
SAMANTHA	I cannot believe you would judge me after everything we've been through.
CARRIE	Where are you going?
SAMANTHA	I'm going to splash some water on my face and then I'm going home.
SAMANTHA	I will not be judged by you or society.
SAMANTHA	I will wear whatever and blow whomever I want as long as I can breathe and kneel.
CARRIE	"That night, Miranda had gone from facing her weight at Weight Watchers to waiting for her Weight Watcher's face."
TOM	Hey Give me those gorgeous lips.
IRANDA	Stop! I can't do that.
TOM	What did I do?
IRANDA	It's not you.
IRANDA	It's me.
IRANDA	Literally me.
IRANDA	I'm all over your face.
IRANDA	All Over.
TOM	Doesn't that happen with other guys?
IRANDA	"Yes, but not so much."
TOM	So what are you saying? I'm a big fat sloppy eater?
IRANDA	No.
IRANDA	I'm just worried I might be too many food points.
TOM	You making jokes?
IRANDA	That's what we do.
IRANDA	Miranda Baby Weight
TOM	But not when I'm vulnerable and naked.
TOM	I'm not comfortable at this weight.
IRANDA	Never mind.
IRANDA	You look great.
IRANDA	take a tissue.
TOM	I don't want one.
TOM	I want a potpie.
IRANDA	You don't want a potpie.
TOM	You're right.
TOM	I want seven.
TOM	I don't think we should see each other any more.
TOM	I've got to concentrate on my diet.
IRANDA	I I was just being silly.
IRANDA	Come back to bed.
IRANDA	Do what you were doing.
IRANDA	You're good at it.
IRANDA	Bon appÃ©tit.
CARRIE	"The bad news was that from then on, Miranda had to go downtown to the notorious Weight Watchers next to the Krispy Kreme, where she wouldn't bump into Tom."
IRANDA	The good news was that she never wanted a glazed doughnut again.
RECEPTIONIST	"Samantha Jones, please hold."
RECEPTIONIST	"Hi, Carrie."
CARRIE	is she in?
RECEPTIONIST	Hello.
CARRIE	Is she alone?
CARRIE	Knock knock.
CARRIE	See? Live it.
CARRIE	Learn it.
CARRIE	That's all I get for a tailor-made knock knock joke? That's better.
CARRIE	"So Two days, four calls, no answer."
SAMANTHA	I know.
SAMANTHA	Sorry.
SAMANTHA	I've been busy.
SAMANTHA	Do we have to do this? Can't we pretend the whole thing didn't happen?
CARRIE	If we don't want to talk on the phone again.
SAMANTHA	"In a few days, it will blow over."
CARRIE	That's an interesting choice of words.
CARRIE	Look I'm sorry.
SAMANTHA	"Carrie, stop."
SAMANTHA	"I don't want to do the ""I'm sorry"" stuff with you."
SAMANTHA	Anyone else but not you.
SAMANTHA	You and I are perfect.
CARRIE	"Sweetie, as lovely as that idea sounds, we're not perfect."
SAMANTHA	We're pretty damn close.
CARRIE	Make no mistake.
CARRIE	It's not my personal style.
CARRIE	But I admire your ability to put your sex life out there.
SAMANTHA	Thank you.
CARRIE	So I brought some looks for my cover.
CARRIE	I want your opinion.
SAMANTHA	You do?
CARRIE	Yeah.
CARRIE	"Well, just in there."
CARRIE	I did judge you.
CARRIE	Just a little.
CARRIE	And I feel bad.
CARRIE	You were so good to me during the whole Big married man affair.
SAMANTHA	It's not just you.
SAMANTHA	I judge me.
SAMANTHA	"Ever since Richard, I don't know who I am."
CARRIE	"Just like that, I realised what was under Samantha's fabulous cover."
SAMANTHA	I'm sorry about the delivery guy.
CARRIE	I had no idea what that must have been like for you.
SAMANTHA	Until I walked in on Stanford
SAMANTHA	getting a blow job from Marcus.
CARRIE	Yeah.
CARRIE	He told me.
SAMANTHA	This is good.
CARRIE	Just the jacket and legs.
CARRIE	With a sexy pair of shoes Stanford was getting a blow job? I thought he would be Never mind.
CARRIE	Too judgmental.
SAMANTHA	"Oh honey, we All thought that."
CAMERA MAN	Here at the camera.
CAMERA MAN	Love that smile.
CAMERA MAN	You look great.
SAMANTHA	What's this?
CAMERA MAN	for the cover Good.
CAMERA MAN	You look gorgeous.
SAMANTHA	"Something Wait, wait."
CARRIE	what? Sometimes It takes a friend to make a picture Perfect.
CARRIE	But a picture-perfect friendship? That's just in books.
SAMANTHA	like it?
PRODUCTION ASSISTANT 	Yes.
SAMANTHA	Isn't she fabulous?
CAMERA MAN	"Big smile, cover girl."
CARRIE	"There is one day, even the most cynical New York woman dreams of all her life."
ANTHONY	"It'll be fabulous. Everything white. White flowers, white tablecloths, white food. W-H-I-T-E. White."
CARRIE	"She imagines what she'll wear, the photographers, the toasts. Everybody's celebrating the fact that she finally found a publisher. It's her book-release party."
SAMANTHA	"This is a sexy event, so don't be afraid to use color."
ANTHONY	I'm not afraid of anything. How about pink? .
SAMANTHA	Hot pink.
ANTHONY	Pink!
SAMANTHA	Isn't it perfect?
CARRIE	It's huge.
SAMANTHA	"Huge space, Huge book."
CARRIE	Who's coming?
SAMANTHA	Everyone.
CARRIE	"Okay, this is cuckoo."
SAMANTHA	Guest list!
CARRIE	"When your career is going better than ever, it's hard not to get a big head."
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, Miranda was back at the office and she was politically incorrectly happy to be there."
SECRETARY	I have Walker Lewis calling.
IRANDA	I'll take that.
CARRIE	Miranda and Walker had shared one night of great sex B.C. Before Child.
IRANDA	I'm so glad I wasn't waiting for your call.
WALKER	I'm so glad you remember me.
IRANDA	I remember you.
WALKER	"I remember you, too. I remember you naked. So, how you been? What's new with you?"
IRANDA	Nothing much. How about you?
WALKER	I was hoping to take you on a very belated second date.
IRANDA	How about Thursday?
CARRIE	She invited him to be her plus one at the book party since she knew she'd be conveniently minus one. Magda had already agreed to babysit.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, Charlotte was working on her perfect plus one: Justin Anderson III."
CHARLOTTE	"Thanks for another lovely lunch, and for walking me home."
JUSTIN	My pleasure.
CHARLOTTE	Justin was just in time because Charlotte was finally ready for a new relationship.
CHARLOTTE	"good afternoon, Mrs. Collier."
RS. COLLIER	"Yes, It certainly was."
CHARLOTTE	And she's one of the friendly ones.
JUSTIN	I think I'd better get back to work.
CARRIE	"I was in a new relationship, too, with my publisher."
COURTNEY	"Okay, bye-bye. I am so freaking excited about this party! Seriously, Carrie, we are so golden. People actually want to come to this book party. All of Cond Nast is coming, including GQ, which is actual straight men. Someone better kiss me at this thing."
CARRIE	"So, it's not about selling books. It's about finding you a boyfriend."
JACK	Courtney... I didn't know you had somebody in here. I'm sorry.
COURTNEY	What are You doing here?

COURTNEY	Jack Berger. We published his first book last year.
CARRIE	And your name is Berger?
JACK	Never heard of me. What does that say about your publicity department?
COURTNEY	not your priMary market.
JACK	Because she's not in my immediate family.
COURTNEY	Jack wrote a hilarious comic novel that speaks to men the same way your column speaks to women.
JACK	Except men don't buy hilarious comic novels. That's the flaw in the plan.
CARRIE	What's your book?
JACK	Half-off. That's what it's called now. It's just half-off. Sometimes it's 75 cents on a card table on Sixth Avenue.
CARRIE	Next to the incense.
JACK	Exactly.
COURTNEY	"You two should talk, because he knows the whole deal: The party, the signings, the reading, the tour."
CARRIE	"Minutes later, Jack Berger and I slowed down for a little fast food."
JACK	I'm not so much feeding them as I'm hitting them.
CARRIE	"Yes, I see that."
JACK	"""'Did the man have a little repressed anger? ""'Or did he just dislike pigeons? ' The woman wondered."""
CARRIE	"The woman is tripping over the term ""repressed."""
JACK	I'm not really bitter. I'm just trying it on for size.
CARRIE	I think It fits.
JACK	It's a little tight in the crotch.
CARRIE	"You're saying ""crotch"" to me? We just met."
JACK	long in the sleeve?
CARRIE	not as funny.
JACK	"See that? It had to be ""crotch."" How's that strawberry shake?"
CARRIE	"It's very tasty, thank you."
JACK	I can't believe that you ordered strawberry. Who orders strawberry after the age of 11?
CARRIE	You have so much to learn about women.
JACK	"That's what a few reviewers said. All right, what's next? How long do I have you for?"
CARRIE	I don't know. What else is on your agenda?
JACK	I gotta pick up some dry cleaning. Would it be weird for you to come with me to pick it up?
CARRIE	No. It would be weird for you to send me.
JACK	It's a nice place. It's right around the corner. Family joint. They have an actual abacus.
CARRIE	We were having one of those great first dates you can only have when it's not an actual date.
CARRIE	Thank you.
CARRIE	What's that?
JACK	It's stupid. I collect found playing cards. They're all over the city.
CARRIE	Really? I never noticed.
JACK	"Well, you will now. That's how it works. I'm hoping to get a full deck. Insert the obvious joke here. And I didn't have a two of hearts. It's a good day."
CARRIE	"Yes, It is. Berger."
JACK	We're on a last-name basis now? Okay.
CARRIE	"Would you, by any chance, want to be my plus one on Thursday? It's my book party, and I don't have a date... and you'll have the clean shirt and all."
JACK	"I would love that, but my girlfriend's parents are coming to visit, and they are staying with us."
CARRIE	"It was like a bomb that just kept exploding: ""I have a girlfriend. We live together. This whole flirtation's in your head."""
CHARLOTTE	He should have mentioned her earlier.
SAMANTHA	"But not too early. I hate it when men do that. ""I have a girlfriend."" Calm down. I just asked if that seat was taken."
CHARLOTTE	That guy's a jerk.
CARRIE	"Thing is, I don't think he is. I sparked with this person. I never spark. I wonder how happy they are. This is not a good side of me. Seriously, what's the point of meeting someone like that if they're not available?"
CHARLOTTE	It's the universe telling you they're still out there.
IRANDA	Maybe the universe is telling you all the good ones are taken.
SAMANTHA	"I'm telling you, all the good ones are coming to the party."
CHARLOTTE	What did he look like?
CARRIE	"I can't remember, which is what happens when I really like someone. I just remember a feeling. Or he was a dating mirage. I was so hungry for a spark, I hallucinated a man."
SAMANTHA	"Stop. You're the toast of the town. Finish your salad, and I'll treat you to a little mani-pedi-botox."
IRANDA	You say that like everybody does it.
SAMANTHA	Everybody will.
CARRIE	I think I'd rather just crawl into bed.
SAMANTHA	"Honey, a little perspective! You have a fun, exciting, intellectually stimulating career, and there's about to be a huge soire thrown in your honor."
CARRIE	And I'll be without a plus one.
SAMANTHA	I'll be your plus one.
CARRIE	"He should have said ""we"" something. ""We go to this dry cleaners."" ""We might be breaking up soon."""
IRANDA	I didn't tell Walker I had a baby.
CHARLOTTE	how Could You not mention it?
IRANDA	"It didn't come up. If he'd asked me directly, ""Have you given birth recently?"" I would have said, ""First of all, define 'recently.""'"
CARRIE	You have to tell him.
IRANDA	"I know. I will. I just don't want it to change everything. If I didn't have a baby, this is a guy I'd be dating."
CHARLOTTE	"If Carrie's guy didn't have a girlfriend, then he's a guy she'd be dating, but he does."
CARRIE	Thanks for bringing that up again.
CARRIE	"In New York, they say you're always looking for a job, a boyfriend, or an apartment. So, let's say you have two out of three, and they're fabulous. Why do we let the one thing we don't have affect how we feel about all the things we do have? Why does one minus a plus one feel like it adds up to zero?"
CARRIE	"Samantha didn't need a man to make her feel positive, but she did need a man to inject her forehead every so often."
AIDE	"We like to warn our patients that some people find it difficult to register emotion on their faces after the injections. So you might have to say: ""I am so angry."""
DOCTOR	Miss Jones is familiar with the procedure.
SAMANTHA	New ones?
CARRIE	"Like most high-powered women, Samantha could handle the stress of her job, but not the stress lines."
DOCTOR	"Before we do the botox, have you thought about a freshening chemical peel? It takes 15 minutes, and it can make you look 10 to 20 years younger."
CARRIE	"15 minutes later, Samantha seemed to have it all...peeled off."
CARRIE	There are times when a woman relishes being alone.
CARRIE	"Oh, my God!"
CARRIE	"And those are the times you usually run into someone you don't wanna see. In my case, it was Enid, my editor at Vogue, also alone."
ENID	Carrie.
CARRIE	Enid. Hi. how are you?
ENID	Good.
CARRIE	are You meeting someone?
ENID	"No, I'm just grabbing a quick bite."
CARRIE	Would You like to...
ENID	"Oh, no. Not if you're working."
CARRIE	It's fine. I was just reading.
ENID	Hello!
CARRIE	Hi.
ENID	Hello! is what you're...
CARRIE	"Oh, reading!"
ENID	"So, do You really want company?"
CARRIE	Sure. I Just ordered.
ENID	I Guess this way I can expense it.
CARRIE	Right.
CARRIE	Enid and I ran out of Vogue stuff to talk about midway through our salads.
CARRIE	do You live in the neighborhood?
ENID	No. But the man I'm seeing does.
CARRIE	"So, there's a man."
ENID	"Yes, There is a man."
CARRIE	"That's great. You have a wildly successful career and a relationship. I was worried we women, only get one or the other, but you have it all. You gotta give me something here. I'm working my ass off."
ENID	"All right. To speak in magazine copy, yes, I have it all on the East Side. He has someone else on the West Side. Luckily, the park provides a buffer."
CARRIE	You're okay with that?
ENID	"Yes. I don't have time for a full-time man. I have a full-time job. That's the key to having it all. Stop expecting it to look like what you thought it would look like. That's true of the fall lines, and it's true of relationships."
CARRIE	"Her little tip earned Enid one invitation to my party. That night, Charlotte let her perfect plus one have it all."
CARRIE	She even let him stay the night in her perfect pre-war apartment.
CHARLOTTE	"Oh, Yes, I ordered breakfast."
JUSTIN	You're too good to be true.
CARRIE	"Unfortunately, Charlotte was about to get much more than she ordered."
BUNNY	is Anybody home?
CHARLOTTE	Yes. I am.
BUNNY	"Hello, Charlotte."
CHARLOTTE	"Bunny, What are You doing here?"
BUNNY	"The question is, what are you doing here? I'm hearing things from the co-op board."
CHARLOTTE	They're spying on me?
BUNNY	Mrs. Collier saw you kissing a male caller in the hall in the middle of the day.
CHARLOTTE	I believe that kissing is allowed.
BUNNY	"And Mrs. Pierce said a gentleman. We assume it was the same one, but who knows came home with you last night. And according to the doorman, he hasn't left yet."
CHARLOTTE	What I do with my life in my apartment...
BUNNY	"That's the thing, dear. It's not your apartment."
CHARLOTTE	Trey gave me this apartment.
BUNNY	"It's not Trey's to give. And this apartment remains in the MacDougal name whereas you, Charlotte York, do not. So, you see, it's rather a sticky subject made stickier by the fact that you're still married."
JUSTIN	You're married?
CHARLOTTE	I'm not married. I'm separated.
BUNNY	Aren't you missing a pair of trousers?
CHARLOTTE	You have to go.
BUNNY	"Don't you hustle me out, young lady. This is Chanel."
CARRIE	"Charlotte discovered that a plus one, plus one ex-mother-in-law equals disaster."
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, I was manning Party Central."
CHARLOTTE	Anthony is going to be my date to the party.
CARRIE	What happened to this perfect plus one we all had to meet?
CHARLOTTE	I don't wanna talk about it.
CARRIE	"Sweetie, what... That's my call waiting. Hang on a sec."
CHARLOTTE	"No, I can't. That's the locksmith. Bunny's back."
STANFORD	"I'm definitely on the list, correct?"
CARRIE	Of course you're on the list.
STANFORD	"Good, 'cause I'm bringing my boyfriend."
CARRIE	"Yes, I heard."
STANFORD	"I don't want to seem like a nobody, now that I have a somebody."
CARRIE	It's okay to be a nobody when you have nobody?
STANFORD	"Apparently, you're nobody till somebody loves you."
CARRIE	I can't believe I used to like that song. It's the co-dependent national anthem.
STANFORD	Methinks someone's a little jealy.
CARRIE	"I just miss having you as my plus one. The gay guy is the single gal's safety net. Even Charlotte has a gay plus one, and this is my big night."
STANFORD	her little boy bitch Anthony is coming?
CARRIE	"Yes, he's coming. He styled the event."
STANFORD	"Good. I'm glad he'll be there. 'Cause he's bringing a woman, and I have it all."
CARRIE	I have a call. see You tonight.
STANFORD	"Okay, ciao."
CARRIE	Hello?
SAMANTHA	"Honey, I've had a little something done and it's not as bad as yesterday, but I've looked better. I'm not sure I should go to the party."
CARRIE	"You have to come. You're my publicist. Thanks to you, there's going to be 8,000 people there. I would like to see at least one familiar face. I need you. I can't talk to the press. I can't keep everyone straight. And you said you'd be my plus one."
SAMANTHA	All right. Don't worry about a thing. I'll be there.
CARRIE	Okay. Thank you.
CARRIE	The party was one of those amazing events that would definitely end up on page 6. The fact that it was my party was just icing on the beautiful little cakes that were being passed around by beautiful little waiters.
PHOTOGRAPHER	"Congratulations! Carrie, one more! Carrie, right here!"
COURTNEY	"Oh, my God, Carrie! Can you believe this?"
CARRIE	Is it a bad thing if the party is better than the book?
COURTNEY	"I've been turning people away. Not the straight men, of course."
CARRIE	Have you seen Samantha? Vanity Fair doesn't have a table.
COURTNEY	Not your problem. Enjoy. Cute guy.
HAROLD KEENAN	"Hello, Carrie. I'm Harold Keenan of The New Yorker. I've been following your career. Let me just say congratulations."
SAMANTHA	"Carrie, I'm here! You look amazing."
CARRIE	"Harold Keenan from The New Yorker. This is Samantha Jones, bee-keeper. What are you doing under there? Talk to the man. Let him see your face."
CARRIE	There she was. My plus one. Minus one layer of skin.
SAMANTHA	"Hi, I've had a chemical peel. I'm Carrie's publicist."
CARRIE	"Could you at least separate the two thoughts, chemical peel, Carrie's publicist? Why did you do this?"
SAMANTHA	It was an impulse purchase.
CARRIE	Gum is an impulse purchase. This is more than gum.
SAMANTHA	I wanted to be super-fresh for the party.
CARRIE	"Well, you are. You look like Beef Carpaccio. Veil down, I think."
SAMANTHA	No. If you knew how many dinner parties I've sat through across from one of these.
CARRIE	and You were able to eat?
SAMANTHA	I'm entitled to a chemical peel.
CARRIE	Wait! No! The hat was good!
SAMANTHA	"Women shouldn't have to hide in the shadows because they've had cosmetic surgery, which society nearly demands of them."
CARRIE	"Make that political statement elsewhere. This is my party, and you're scaring people."
SAMANTHA	I've had a chemical peel.
CARRIE	And she's not afraid to say it.
ARCUS	"When I had my nose job, I stayed in for a month."
STANFORD	Excuse us. We have to go find Charlotte and her tiny little friend.
CHARLOTTE	We were just getting to know each other. I was planning on telling him.
ANTHONY	"You can wrap it up in a Tiffany bow, but the point is you wanted to get laid first."
STANFORD	"Charlotte, Hello."
CHARLOTTE	"Hi, Stanford. You remember Anthony."
STANFORD	"You tried to fix us up at the fashion show. I didn't know he'd be here. This is Marcus, my boyfriend."
ANTHONY	Really? how long You two been going together?
STANFORD	four months.
ANTHONY	four whole months. good luck to you.
STANFORD	We don't need luck. We're in love.
ANTHONY	Shrimp!
CARRIE	"For some people, having it all is not enough. They need someone who missed out on it all to be jealous."
STANFORD	We're getting a house in the Hamptons.
ANTHONY	Friggin' coconut shrimp! What do you do with the tails? Mr. Shrimpy!
STANFORD	And he has a large penis!
CHARLOTTE	Where in the Hamptons?
CARRIE	From a pair of queens to a hand still not shown...
WALKER	Maybe You and I should Go somewhere a little less crowded. Like...
IRANDA	Anywhere in Manhattan?
WALKER	your apartment?
IRANDA	"Yes, But first I have to Tell You something."
WALKER	There's someone else.
IRANDA	Sort of. I had a baby. But I'm still allowed to have sex.
WALKER	is it... mine?
IRANDA	The guy's a friend who I accidentally slept with.
WALKER	I'm not good with kids.
IRANDA	"Neither am I. Months from now, if we're still together, we'll figure this out."
IRANDA	"But for now, it's just us and I'm still the same person. Let's go screw our brains out."
IRANDA	That feels amazing!
WALKER	You sure we won't wake him?
IRANDA	He's fine.
CARRIE	"Miranda was trying to prove she could still do it all: Bring home the bacon, bring home the baby, and bring home an orgasm."
IRANDA	Don't stop. Mommy's coming!
WALKER	I don't think I can do this. I told you. I'm not a baby guy.
IRANDA	Couldn't I just please come first?
IRANDA	"Oh, so now you stop crying. So, here we are."
CARRIE	"The night of my big party, Miranda finally gave in to her little party, because she wasn't the same person. She was plus one."
ISSAC	"So, a book! Does anybody read books anymore? Actually, I think books are coming back. You can quote me on the side of a bus if you want: ""Books are back."" Isaac Mizrahi."
CARRIE	"Okay, I'll remember that."
ISSAC	meet me.
ENID	"perfect party, Carrie. Congratulations."
CARRIE	worth Coming downtown for?
CARRIE	Was that a yes or a no? Last one. Thank you.
CARRIE	"As I looked around, I thought, ""Who needs a date?"" I can have my cake and eat it, too. Then suddenly, there he was, looking cuter than I remembered and minus one girlfriend."
JACK	"Hey, lady of the hour. You're hard to get to."
CARRIE	"So's the dessert tray, when it's your party."
JACK	"Just as a point of reference, my book party could have fit in the coat check of your party."
CARRIE	400 of my closest acquaintances.
JACK	You look great.
CARRIE	I thought you couldn't make it.
JACK	"I had to come by, say Congratulations."
CARRIE	"Thanks for Coming, Berger."
JACK	All Right. good luck with the book and everything.
CARRIE	"You, too."
CHARLOTTE	was That the spark Guy?
CARRIE	"Yes, It was. Jack Berger. All by his lonesome."
CHARLOTTE	he is awfully cute.
CARRIE	is he? I forgot again.
SAMANTHA	"He's obviously here because he felt something, too."
CARRIE	"Can you call me from a cab and tell me that? I love you, but your face..."
SAMANTHA	I know. The caterer just shooed me away from the buffet. Do you mind if I go home?
CARRIE	I thought you'd never ask! Thank you for being here.
SAMANTHA	"Honey, I wouldn't have gone out in public like this for anyone but you."
CARRIE	I know. And I have to live with that.
CHARLOTTE	"I might go, too. My plus one dumped me for a shrimp waiter."
CARRIE	"I'd love to leave, but I have to stay. I'm like the ice sculpture the party's supposed to happen around. I had to let him go, correct? I just wish he'd told me right up front."
CHARLOTTE	"The thing is, there's some things people don't admit because they just don't like the way it sounds. Like, ""I'm getting divorced."""
CARRIE	I'm lonely. I am. The loneliness is palpable.
ENID	Don't tell me you invited Cliff.
CARRIE	Cliff Who?
ENID	My Cliff. He's with her.
CARRIE	That's him? Cliff from Primetime Stories? Don't make a scene! Is this her side of town?
ENID	"We're below Houston! East Side, West Side, who the hell knows down here? I am so angry."
CARRIE	"As it turns out, even the most together-woman can't keep it together when it comes to love..."
CHARLOTTE	who was that?
CARRIE	my role model.
CARRIE	"...Because just below the surface, we're all raw and exposed."
DRIVER	"So, What was the party for?"
CARRIE	me. I have a book Coming out.
DRIVER	You wrote a book!
CARRIE	"It's just a collection of my... Yes, I wrote a book."
DRIVER	That's amazing! Congratulations.
CARRIE	Thank you.
CARRIE	It was kind of amazing. Why did I need a stranger to remind me of that?
DRIVER	where can I take you?
CARRIE	Home. 73rd and...
DRIVER	"No, we have to celebrate this."
DRIVER	"Come on, rapido, Papi."
DRIVER	I want to Tell him.
CARRIE	"Oh, no, I don't..."
DRIVER	She wrote a book.
HOTDOG VENDOR	"No kidding! Congratulations. Gonna be in the bookstores and everything? That's great. If that's the case, then tonight, the hot dogs are on me."
CARRIE	You don't have to...
HOTDOG VENDOR	the dogs are on me. I insist.
DRIVER	Thanks.
HOTDOG VENDOR	Sure. have a Nice weekend.
CARRIE	"All I could think was, who needs a Berger when you can get a fabulous hot dog for 75 cents or free? Then again, maybe there is something to knowing they're out there."
CARRIE	"In the life of a New Yorker, there are several unpleasant things one will inevitably have to face: Having your purse stolen, random public urination, and seeing a gay friend's boyfriend in a Broadway revue."
CARRIE	I think I understand the three-drink minimum now.
STANFORD	You're not enjoying the revue?
CARRIE	"Frankly, I'm more concerned about my own review in the Times."
STANFORD	"Oh, my God, right, your book's reviewed this week. You must be so excited."
CARRIE	More like terrified. Michiko Kakutani. She's the Times' book critic.
STANFORD	I thought you were suggesting an appetizer.
CARRIE	"She's brilliant, and she's really tough."
STANFORD	and impossible to pronounce.
CARRIE	I think they're bringing us home.
STANFORD	How could you not love this? Look at my boyfriend. He's gorgeous.
CARRIE	And he can kick.
STANFORD	Bravo!
ANNOUNCER	Thank you. My boys Marcus Adante...
STANFORD	"Isn't he great? He's great, don't you think?"
CARRIE	I have to go to the ladies' room.
STANFORD	Now? They're gonna do an encore.
CARRIE	I have to go to the ladies' room.
ANNOUNCER	Broadway's best: Debbie Cass.
WOMAN	"Who would have thought the phrase, ""Go see your cousin Debbie's club act"" could contain such horror?"
WOMAN 2	"I thought there'd be at least one straight guy here. I mean, if not in the audience, then at least behind the bar."
WOMAN	"Hold on, 'cause Tomorrow, we're gonna cruise the cute pretzel guys at the Village Square Market."
WOMAN	Is that as sad as that just sounded?
CARRIE	"If it makes you feel any better, I had a thing for the Amish guys who make hairbrushes."
WOMAN	"Hi, you're Carrie Bradshaw."
CARRIE	"Yeah, have we met?"
WOMAN	I recognized you from your column. And I went out with Aidan right after you.
CARRIE	"There I was, worried about the New York Times when apparently I'd already been reviewed."
CARRIE	"I'm telling you, it was a hit-and-run. No, it was a face-and-run."
SAMANTHA	"Make it again. Yeah, that ain't good."
CHARLOTTE	"I think you're being oversensitive, and it was a facial spasm or something. A lot of people have them, like Bell's palsy."
CARRIE	"No, it was not Bell's palsy. It was a full-frontal attack of the face like: ""Wow, was he messed up. You really screwed him up good."""
SAMANTHA	What did you say to her?
CARRIE	I didn't have time to say anything. She just ran out of the bathroom.
IRANDA	Fuck that fucking face girl.
CARRIE	"Well, when You put It like that..."
IRANDA	I'm sorry.
IRANDA	I haven't slept for days. Brady's been crying non-stop.
CARRIE	You poor thing. can I do anything?
IRANDA	put me out Of my misery.
CHARLOTTE	What's wrong with him? Is he sick?
IRANDA	"No, he's not sick. He's not hungry, he's not teething, he just wants to scream. I'm doing everything I can, but I can't please him. If he was 35, this is when we would break up."
CARRIE	"He has issues, clearly."
IRANDA	"I'm telling you, this 13-pound meatloaf is pushing me over the edge."
IRANDA	"I feel disgusting. All of my clothes smell like barf. I don't have time to shower, much less get a haircut."
SAMANTHA	"That reminds me, I have to confirm my appointment with John Mandy at the John Mandy Salon. You have no idea how hard it was to get this appointment. Hi, it's Samantha Jones. I'm calling to confirm my appointment Saturday for a cut-and-color with John. Thanks. Crisis averted."
IRANDA	Magda is waiting for me. Time to go back to prison.
CHARLOTTE	let me come with you. I can help.
IR	You don't have to do that.
CHARLOTTE	"No, it's okay. Actually, I have a few questions because I'm meeting with the divorce lawyer on Monday."
CARRIE	Ask him if I could get an injunction to stop a face.
IRANDA	who did You get?
CHARLOTTE	Matthew Bloom of Bloom & Goldenblatt. What's he like?
IRANDA	"He's smart, he's tough."
CHARLOTTE	But is he tough enough to beat Bunny to a pulp?
IRANDA	Yeah.
CHARLOTTE	"Good. Okay, great. Bye, guys. have a Nice day."
CARRIE	"Miranda, call me if you need anything."
CARRIE	Damn! Why is that girl still bothering me?
SAMANTHA	"Honey, you have to let it go. If I worried what every bitch in New York said about me, I'd never leave the house."
CARRIE	"Early Monday morning, Charlotte met with her lawyer. He was smart, tough, and gorgeous."
ATTHEW BLOOM	"You said you had some bad feelings about your mother-in-law, Bunny MacDougal."
CHARLOTTE	Did I?
ATTHEW BLOOM	I get a sense from her lawyer this is going to be a bit of a battle.
CARRIE	"It was a battle, all right. The battle of the Charlottes. The Charlotte who wanted to seem attractive to her adorable lawyer and the Charlotte who wanted to kick Bunny MacDougal's ass."
ATTHEW BLOOM	It looks to me that Mrs. MacDougal has been very busy hiding assets to make sure you don't get anything.
CHARLOTTE	I just really want what was promised. I want my apartment.
ATTHEW BLOOM	"Technically, it's not your apartment. Trey's family owns it. She was very careful to ensure your name was not on the deed."
CHARLOTTE	"What? Trey gave me that apartment. Sorry. Usually, I'm a very refined person."
ATTHEW BLOOM	"With your husband out of the country, I'm gonna need you to be more specific."
CARRIE	Charlotte realized she could never be as ugly as she needed to be in front of a man she considered so handsome.
HARRY	Sorry to bust in. There's a bagel here with my name on it.
ATTHEW BLOOM	"My partner, Harry. Harry, Charlotte York. I'm handling her divorce."
HARRY	How you doing? You're in the right hands here. He's a killer. Who the hell ordered blueberry bagels? I'm talking to Thelma about this. Good luck to you.
CHARLOTTE	"Is he a killer, too?"
CARRIE	"And just like that, Charlotte changed lawyers."
CARRIE	"After a grueling day, which included leg, eyebrow, and bikini waxes, Samantha decided to reward herself with a night of R and R. Unfortunately, her favorite vibrator needed a little CPR."
IRANDA	"Brady, please. What? I cannot read your mind."
IRANDA	who is it?
KENDALL	4-D. It's 2:30 in the morning.
IRANDA	I know. I'm sorry.
KENDALL	You gotta Stop That baby from crying.
IRANDA	"I said I was sorry, but I have a baby and sometimes babies make noise. That's what they do."
KENDALL	"I know that. I have a baby, too. And if you ever bothered to say hello in the elevator, you'd know that. I'm Kendall, my baby is Alika. Have a nice night."
CARRIE	"Evidently, Miranda had been getting bad reviews from inside her own building."
CARRIE	"As for my review, I guess I was pretty nervous."
CARRIE	times.
NEWSTAND VENDOR	Thank you.
CARRIE	I hadn't been up this early since Princess Diana's wedding.
CARRIE	Good morning.
CARRIE	"""All in all, I enjoyed spending time in Ms. Bradshaw's sharp, funny, finely-drawn world where single women rule, and the men are disposable."" Ouch!"
IRANDA	I believe what you have there is a rave review from the New York Times.
CARRIE	"""The men are disposable""? I don't dispose of men, do I?"
IRANDA	no.
CARRIE	"Michiko Kakutani thinks So, and I always agree with her."
IRANDA	Fuck Michiko Kakutani.
CARRIE	No sleep again?
IRANDA	"Actually, it was a good night. I got a whole hour. I can't believe I have to go and pretend to be a lawyer now. Can I wear a baseball cap to work?"
CARRIE	"With what shoes? My God, listen to me going on and on about Michiko Kakutani when you have real problems. So can I obsess for another minute?"
IRANDA	Just don't say her name again. It'll push me over the edge.
CARRIE	"So, yes, some of the men in the book are maybe a little disposable, but this makes it sound like I think men are disposable in life. What? What's with the pause?"
IRANDA	I'm sorry. I fell asleep for a second.
CARRIE	"That's a terrible thing to think about me. Oh, my God, that's what the face meant. Do you think that Aidan thinks that I think he was disposable?"
IRANDA	"Carrie, you did not throw Aidan away."
AGDA	Good morning.
CARRIE	That girl thinks I did. He must have said something like that to her. Where else would she get it? Steve and Aidan are close. Has Steve ever said anything to you? Does Steve hate me now?
IRANDA	"Carrie, you're spinning. Steve doesn't hate you."
CARRIE	Then how come I never see him anymore?
IRANDA	"You never see him because I have to keep him away. Because if I see him now, I'll ask him to marry me just to give me some help."
CARRIE	I worked very hard at taking care of Aidan's feelings. Will you mention that to Steve? Because if Aidan told Steve...
IRANDA	"Carrie, you know what? Maybe you should call your girlfriend Samantha. She has all kinds of time to talk about this kind of stuff. I know it's me and I'm jealous of her free time and all, but if she could maybe just once acknowledge the fact that I've had a baby... It's not enough I've alienated my neighbor. Now I'm alienating my friends."
CARRIE	You're not alienating anyone.
IRANDA	Tell that to 4-D. She's pissed off I don't know her name. Do you know your neighbors' names?
CARRIE	Please.
IRANDA	I'm a bad neighbor and a bad mother.
CARRIE	That's not true. You're doing great.
IRANDA	"Yeah, Right."
CARRIE	You're just having a bad week. Can I do anything to help?
IRANDA	"That helps, just asking. I'm late. I gotta go. Congratulations on the review."
CARRIE	"Why is it that we only seem to believe the negative things people say about us, no matter how much evidence there is to the contrary? A neighbor, a face, an ex-boyfriend can cancel out everything we thought was once true. Odd, but when it comes to life and love, why do we believe our worst reviews?"
CARRIE	"After a long day in court, Miranda faced another jury."
IRANDA	Don't cry.
CARRIE	"And at City Bakery, Samantha and I were reviewing the desserts."
CARRIE	Delish. I'll buy you dessert if you do something for me.
SAMANTHA	I'm not eating desserts this week.
CARRIE	"come on, best brownies in New York."
SAMANTHA	Bastard. I'll take a brownie. What do you need me to do?
CARRIE	It's about Miranda and the baby.
SAMANTHA	forget the brownie.
CARRIE	"No, she'll take the brownie."
SAMANTHA	"Babies are not my scene. And from what I've heard, this one sounds like an asshole."
CARRIE	You can't call a baby an asshole.
SAMANTHA	Why not? she called It a meatloaf.
CARRIE	I don't think it would kill all of us to be a little more supportive.
SAMANTHA	"All right. When he's in college, I'll take him for a drink and flirt with his friends. How's that?"
CARRIE	"Maybe you could just stop by Tomorrow and say: ""I hear you had a baby. How's that going?"""
SAMANTHA	"I have no time. I'm booked all day. I have my hair appointment, and I'm returning a vibrator before that."
CARRIE	Hair and a vibrator?
SAMANTHA	"Yes, that is my life, and I don't have to justify it. I hate it when people have babies and they suddenly expect you turn into a Norman Rockwell painting."
CARRIE	"We're not talking about people, we're talking about our friend. And she's sinking."
SAMANTHA	"What, so, Miranda's like Venice?"
CASHIER	That'll be $14.20.
CARRIE	She's paying for the brownie.
JULIA	Carrie.
CARRIE	"Julia, Hi."
CARRIE	This is my friend Samantha. This is Julia Afton. We work together at Vogue.
JULIA	Hardly. She gets to run in and out once a month while I'm chained to the hem of Anna Wintour. There's my friend. Nina. I'm here. It is about time.
NINA	"Sorry I'm late. Carrie, hi."
CARRIE	"There I was, face to face with the face girl."
JULIA	how do You two know each other?
NINA	I'll tell you over lunch.
NINA	Nina Katz.
SAMANTHA	Hi. Samantha Jones.
NINA	"Hi, nice to see you again. Can we eat? I'm starvation central."
JULIA	Okey-dokey. see you.
NINA	"Bye, Carrie."
SAMANTHA	how do You know Nina Katz?
CARRIE	how do You know Nina Katz?
SAMANTHA	Everybody knows Nina Katz. She's the booker for Saturday Night Live.
CARRIE	She's also the face girl.
SAMANTHA	
CARRIE	Exactly. great. That face will be All over Vogue.
SAMANTHA	not to mention SNL. Nina Katz loves to talk.
CASHIER	$15.30.
CARRIE	I'm going to need a big brownie as well.
CARRIE	"The next day, Samantha did some personal shopping. Very personal."
CLERK	can I help you?
SAMANTHA	"Yes, I'd like to return this vibrator."
CLERK	We don't sell vibrators.
SAMANTHA	"Yes, You do. I bought It here six months ago."
CLERK	That's not a vibrator. It's a neck massager.
SAMANTHA	"No, it's a vibrator."
CLERK	Sharper lmage doesn't sell vibrators. It's a neck massager.
SAMANTHA	You expect me to believe that women buy these to help their sore necks?
CLERK	It's a neck massager.
SAMANTHA	Fine. I'd like to return this neck massager.
CLERK	What's wrong with it?
SAMANTHA	"It failed to get me off. It has a warranty, and it just stopped. Made the saddest little sound."
CLERK	Perhaps You wore It out.
SAMANTHA	"Honey, it wouldn't be the first one."
CLERK	"Fine. Just find another, and go to the cashier."
SAMANTHA	"I know a man who's in desperate need of a neck massage. You don't want that one. Too many bells and whistles. That one actually works against you. If we wanted to work that hard, we'd get us a man. Am I right?"
CARRIE	Samantha instantly established herself as the Michiko Kakutani of vibrators.
WOMAN	I think that one actually is a back massager.
SAMANTHA	"Not if you mount it. No, absolutely not. That will burn your clit off."
WOMAN 2	even with underwear?
SAMANTHA	even with ski pants.
KENDALL	I brought you something. It belongs to Alika. An oscillating chair. It helps.
IRANDA	come on in.
KENDALL	"Hey, There, Mr. mouth. What have You got to say That is So important?"
IRANDA	I'm sorry. It's just been non-stop.
KENDALL	"Now, this chair is a little controversial, but I don't give a shit. 'Cause it stopped my baby from crying when I was about ready to throw myself off the fire escape."
IRANDA	"Sounds good. Oh, my God! The chair is genius."
KENDALL	Something about the vibration... I don't know. They love it. Alika could sit in it for hours. How come you haven't heard about this? Don't your girlfriends have babies?
IRANDA	"No, I'm the only one."
KENDALL	Then you're screwed.
IRANDA	"Actually, they've been very helpful."
KENDALL	"If they don't have kids, they don't have a clue. Miranda, you're not a bad mother. You just didn't have the chair."
IRANDA	Thank you... Kendall.
CARRIE	Three blissful baby hours later...
IRANDA	"Samantha, what're you doing here?"
SAMANTHA	"I'm not Samantha, you are. You have a 5:30 appointment with John Mandy at the John Mandy Salon. Go."
IRANDA	What? I can't take your...
SAMANTHA	"I'm counting to five, then I'm changing my mind."
IRANDA	Really? You want to baby-sit?
SAMANTHA	"five, four..."
IRANDA	Okay. I don't know what to say. I can't believe it.
SAMANTHA	"Neither can I, but here I am, Mary fucking Poppins."
IRANDA	"Thank you. The numbers are on the fridge, and don't take him out of that chair. It's the only thing that keeps him quiet. And don't call boys."
SAMANTHA	You don't look so bad.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, in a chair across town, I was enjoying an afternoon of absolutely nothing."
CARRIE	Do you think Nina Katz is telling random celebrity hosts that I'm the bad-breakup girlfriend?
SAMANTHA	What?
CARRIE	"You said she loved to talk. Do you think she's trashing me to, say, a Gwyneth Paltrow or an lan McKellen?"
SAMANTHA	You can't be serious.
CARRIE	Don't get me wrong. I don't flatter myself that a Gwyneth Paltrow or an lan McKellen would be interested in my love life. Are you at a zoo?
SAMANTHA	"No, thanks to you, I am at Miranda's and Brady won't stop screaming, and I don't know what to do."
CARRIE	You're at Miranda's?
SAMANTHA	I sent her to get my haircut.
CARRIE	That was nice.
SAMANTHA	"Yes, and now I'm being punished."
CARRIE	So he's not hurt?
SAMANTHA	no.
CARRIE	Or wet?
SAMANTHA	no.
CARRIE	Then I don't know what his problem is.
SAMANTHA	His problem is he's an asshole.
CARRIE	Maybe you should call Miranda.
SAMANTHA	I will not. It took me months to get that appointment. Someone should benefit. I'll find some way to keep this kid quiet. Goodbye.
CARRIE	"No, wait, what about Nina?"
SAMANTHA	Maybe Charlotte has the time to talk about this kind of stuff. I have a screaming baby on my hands. What? What do you need?
SAMANTHA	"Well, that's better."
IRANDA	is Everything okay?
SAMANTHA	"Absolutely. the chair thing broke. But, You know, Shit happens."
IRANDA	"The chair broke? But what did you... I mean, did he... That better be brand-new."
CARRIE	"Monday morning, Harry did his best to make sure Bunny didn't hop all over Charlotte."
ALLAN	Mrs. MacDougal is willing to offer her son's collection of mint-condition silver Buffalo coins.
HARRY	Could we get off the coin collection? She's not going to settle for coin collection.
ALLAN	According to the pre-nup...
CHARLOTTE	This is ridiculous. Trey gave me that apartment.
BUNNY	She gave him her word. Till death do them part.
CHARLOTTE	"Bunny, if you have something to say to me..."
BUNNY	Fine. I shall.
ALLAN	I strongly recommend...
BUNNY	"Allan, hush. You, my dear, took a vow. And when things didn't go your way, you simply broke that vow. I come from a generation of women that valued marriage. We believed in ""for better or for worse."" Not ""for better, or until the road gets rocky."" When I think of the heartache and shame you caused my dear boy... I'm amazed that you could even come here and look me in the face."
CARRIE	Charlotte couldn't fight any more. It seemed to her she'd been fighting for this marriage forever.
BUNNY	"Be advised, young lady, I'm more than prepared to go to court."
ALLAN	It's the coin collection. Take it or leave it.
HARRY	"Just hold on. Apparently, our office received a telegram from Scotland from Dr. MacDougal. Shall I read it?"
BUNNY	By all means.
HARRY	"""Charlotte York was a wonderful wife. Stop.She did nothing wrong. Stop. Give her everything she wants. Stop. Seriously, Mother. Stop."""
CARRIE	"That's the thing about reviews. Sometimes, when you least expect it, you get a rave."
ALLAN	Just the apartment.
HARRY	"I'll have papers drawn up, so Mrs. MacDougal can transfer the deed."
CARRIE	"Even though things had gotten ugly, Charlotte didn't want them to end that way."
CHARLOTTE	I'm sorry things didn't work out better for all of us.
CARRIE	Charlotte realized there was no such thing as a fairy-tale divorce either.
HARRY	"""Ding dong, the witch is dead."""
CARRIE	"And farther uptown, still unable to let it go, Nina Katz and that face had driven me to face my worst fear."
CARRIE	"So, Steve, I know I was kind of vague on the phone..."
STEVE	"It's Miranda, right? She doesn't want me to call her so much. It's fine."
CARRIE	"No, it's not about Miranda. It's about... How does Aidan feel about me?"
STEVE	"Jeez, no. You're not going to try to get back together with him again, are you?"
CARRIE	"No, but that pretty much answers any question I had about how you feel. So, what, does he hate me?"
STEVE	"No, but come on, Carrie, it was pretty bad."
CARRIE	"how bad? Steve, the ball."
STEVE	Sorry.
CARRIE	how is he now?
STEVE	Great. He's great.
CARRIE	Good.
STEVE	"Now. But back then, he couldn't get out of bed for like..."
CARRIE	"what? days, weeks?"
STEVE	"like, a month. I brought Him chicken wings."
CARRIE	"Oh, Christ."
STEVE	I don't mean to make you feel bad.
CARRIE	a month?
STEVE	"Yeah, he was devastated. He lost his ability to open up and trust women."
CARRIE	He lost his ability to open up and trust women? Did he tell you that?
STEVE	"No, guys don't talk about shit like that. We just ate wings. But the girl, Nina, he was dating, she told me that."
CARRIE	"Okay, we're looking for the cute pretzel guys."
STANFORD	How come you never wanted to cruise guys when I was available?
CARRIE	"This isn't about cruising, it's about clarity. That face chick is hitting a little too close to home. I want to find her and tell her my side of the breakup story."
STANFORD	Why? You know what you and Aidan had.
CARRIE	"I know it, but she doesn't.And she's yip-yapping her version all over town. It only takes one bad review to cancel out all the good word-of-mouth."
STANFORD	What do you think of Marcus?
CARRIE	"Nice. I mean, relationships are complicated. You can't reduce them to a face. I know that Aidan has feelings..."
STANFORD	"Okay, stop. I am done. I've listened to you talk about Aidan, for what...ten blocks, and two years? And I've been a wonderful audience. And I ask you about my Marcus, and all I get is ""nice""?"
CARRIE	I'm sorry.
STANFORD	How many relationships have I been in since you've known me?
CARRIE	Real or imaginary?
STANFORD	"Come on, your opinion means a lot to me. You're my Machiko Kakamatsa."
CARRIE	"So, now what, you want me to review your relationship?"
STANFORD	"Immediately, if not sooner."
CARRIE	"Okay, well, I like that he makes you happy."
NINA	"Carrie? okay, one more time, and you are officially stalking me."
HEATHER	"Hi, I'm Heather."
STANFORD	Heather Graham. I know. I love you. I'm Stanford Blatch.
NINA	"Sorry. Heather, this is Carrie Bradshaw."
HEATHER	"Carrie Bradshaw, Really?"
CARRIE	"I need to talk to you for a second, alone, if I can."
STANFORD	"Miss Graham, may I buy you a pretzel?"
HEATHER	Okay.
NINA	get me one.
HEATHER	a man Or a pretzel?
NINA	Whatever has less carbs.
HEATHER	Right.
CARRIE	"I get the sense that you have a sort of feeling about what happened with Aidan, and I just want to clear something up. Breakups are awful, and they are private. And they are not necessarily sympTomatic of what two people had together. I loved Aidan very much. And I would never, ever have done anything to deliberately hurt him."
NINA	Okay.
CARRIE	"Suddenly, I realized the critic I was most afraid of wasn't Nina Katz. It was me."
CARRIE	"So, bye."
CARRIE	"The truth is, at any given moment, someone, somewhere could be making a face about you. But it's the reviews you give yourself that matter."
STANFORD	"...with Heather Graham and I'm like, ""Shit, what do we have to talk about?"""
CARRIE	Being pretty.
STANFORD	I know. But we had Nothing to talk about But pretzels. So I said...
CARRIE	Come on.
STANFORD	"I said, ""Have you ever been to Bavaria? They make the best pretzels there."""
CARRIE	"One night, four ladies in the east met at Compass to discuss going west."
CARRIE	I have to go to San Francisco on a book tour.
SAMANTHA	"You wouldn't go to the Upper West Side. Suddenly, you're going to San Francisco?"
CARRIE	"They're making me. Apparently, I'm very big in San Francisco."
IRANDA	"You mean, Big is in San Francisco."
CARRIE	"Okay, yes, perhaps I'll see Big. Guys, I need to have sex. It's been too long. Lately, I've been having these dreams where I run. I run up to complete strangers and just start kissing them."
IRANDA	No need to go across the country for sex. Go across the restaurant. Those guys have been checking us out ever since they sat down.
CHARLOTTE	cute.
SAMANTHA	"Boring, Boring and boring. like these scallops."
CHARLOTTE	I love the food here.
SAMANTHA	"same old, same old."
CARRIE	Same old? It just opened last week.
SAMANTHA	"Scallops are scallops, and bachelors are bachelors."
CARRIE	"Sounds to me like you might be experiencing a ""been there, done them"" existential crisis."
SAMANTHA	"It's not me, it's New York. Nothing is ever really new. In fact, they should change the name to ""Same York."""
IRANDA	"You're nuts. These scallops are fantastic, and those guys are cute."
CHARLOTTE	You should go say hi. May I?
CARRIE	"No, I don't want to say hi. I want to say: ""Could one of you lie on top of me for a while?"" I need to feel the weight of a man on me."
IRANDA	"At times like this, I wish women could go to male prostitutes."
SAMANTHA	Women do.
CARRIE	"No, only in bad screenplays and first novels."
IRANDA	"That is an incredible investment idea. We should open a brothel where the men are cute, and the sheets are 500-count Egyptian cotton. Samantha, you can be the madam."
SAMANTHA	At least it's something new.
CARRIE	"We could put one in every neighborhood, like Starbucks."
SAMANTHA	Starfucks.
CHARLOTTE	"Such a place doesn't exist in reality because women don't think about sex like that. It's not an animal urge. We need to feel things. We need a connection. Isn't that right, Carrie?"
CARRIE	"No, Big is my male prostitute. I am mixing business with much-needed pleasure. And my relief is just a train ride away."
IRANDA	A train? Why don't you just fly?
CARRIE	"No, flying makes me nervous. I get uneasy seeing the National Guard go through my makeup case. Besides, it'll be fun. Especially if Samantha goes with me. Please, come on, it'll be hilarious."
CARRIE	Two gals on a train. Very Some Like It Hot. And the whole trip ends with a luxury suite in a fabulous four-star San Francisco hotel.
CHARLOTTE	Why didn't you invite me?
CARRIE	Because Samantha is the only one who's bored enough to do it.
SAMANTHA	"So what time do we leave ""Same York""?"
CARRIE	I'm gonna get laid.
CARRIE	"More and more single women of a certain age are looking for a certain thing. And that certain thing does not necessarily involve a certain ring. We may have traded the little black book for a little black dress, and replaced the Ferrari with a Fendi. But in view of certain evidence, I had to wonder: Are we the new bachelors?"
SAMANTHA	What did Big say when you told him?
CARRIE	"I haven't yet. I'm gonna wait till I get there. You know, ""Hello, guess where I am."" Very casual, very..."
SAMANTHA	"That's one approach. I would have called and said: ""I'm coming, and I won't be the only one."""
CARRIE	"I think I'm getting a pimple. Can you see anything? Right here, above my freckle."
SAMANTHA	All clear.
CARRIE	"Good, the last thing I need is a big, honking zit when I meet my prostitute."
SAMANTHA	"This may be just what I needed, if I can stand the train for three days."
CARRIE	"Think of it as an adventure. ""It's not the destination, it's the journey."" A journey in adjoining, first-class, deluxe sleeper berths."
SAMANTHA	"Truth be told, I've always wanted to take a train. It's so sexy."
SAMANTHA	You never know who's going to be getting on and getting me off.
CONDUCTOR	All aboard.
CARRIE	"Hello, sir."
CARRIE	"We were supposed to have the deluxe, first-class sleeper."
CONDUCTOR	This is the first-class sleeper.
SAMANTHA	And I suppose the regular class sleeps in what? A tuna can?
CONDUCTOR	"Right here, you have your door to the restroom."
CARRIE	Wait. You shower over the toilet?
SAMANTHA	I'm starting to understand why there was a murder on the Orient Express.
CARRIE	And in a far less crowded space...
HARRY	delivery from Bloom & Goldenblatt.
CHARLOTTE	I thought they'd send a messenger.
HARRY	Do you know what we'd charge you for a messenger to make a 12-block drop?
CHARLOTTE	"So, a partner personally delivers my divorce papers?"
HARRY	"sure, Why not? I needed the walk."
CHARLOTTE	"Okay. I was Just gonna Go work out, But come in."
HARRY	It's hot.
CHARLOTTE	Excuse me?
HARRY	Outside. I'm schvitzing like a pudding at a picnic. This is the pagoda we've been fighting over. It's impressive. I can see why you'd never want to give it up.
CHARLOTTE	"Actually, I'm thinking about selling."
HARRY	after What we went through to get it?
CHARLOTTE	It's too big for one person. I'm putting the word out. If anyone knows a great apartment...
HARRY	I got a buddy who has a place. It may be a little too bachelor for your taste.
CHARLOTTE	I can change that. You should've seen this place earlier. It was where plaid furniture came to die.
HARRY	I Could set It up So You can get a first Look.
CHARLOTTE	Okay.
HARRY	"Done. So let's get you divorced. Sit, and sign."
CHARLOTTE	Do you have a handkerchief or something? You're still sweating.
HARRY	Sorry. This never happens. Thanks.
CHARLOTTE	That's it?
HARRY	That's it. You are no longer Mrs. Trey MacDougal.
CHARLOTTE	how do You like that?
HARRY	I like it.
CHARLOTTE	You have some tissue stuck to you.
HARRY	I'm a fucking mess today.
CARRIE	"Somewhere outside of Pittsburgh, Samantha and I decided to get out of our twin cans and go for a classic train dinner in the club car."
CARRIE	This is it? I thought there'd be white linen tablecloths and Bing Crosby singing at a piano.
CARRIE	"Excuse me, table for two, please."
CONDUCTOR	Just sit anywhere that's open.
CARRIE	"Sorry, the train zigged. Okay. Excuse me. Sorry."
CARRIE	Really? Hello. Thank you.
SAMANTHA	"I'm eating with the Amish? Are you aware, every time we stop, good-looking people get off and more ugly people get on? I'm serious, this is the train to ugly. There isn't one man on this train I'd fuck. What about you?"
CARRIE	Don't ask me. I'm horny. And nine hours of train-rocking hasn't helped. Sorry.
SAMANTHA	"If she has a problem, next time she can take a buggy."
SAMANTHA	How would the Zagat Guide rate a place that lists potato chips as an appetizer?
CARRIE	"Don't even say ""potato chip"" to me. This zit is getting bigger by the hour. Can you see it now?"
SAMANTHA	Let's just say you're starting to look like you belong on a train.
CARRIE	Really?
CONDUCTOR	What can I get you?
SAMANTHA	a martini and an airplane.
CARRIE	What's safe to order?
CONDUCTOR	the club sandwich.
CARRIE	"And a martini. God, I need a big old drink. Again, sorry."
CARRIE	And speaking of martinis...
CHARLOTTE	a zebra-skin rug.
HARRY	I told You he was a bachelor.
CHARLOTTE	But a bar in the bedroom?
HARRY	You ain't seen nothing yet.
CHARLOTTE	You seem to know your way around here.
HARRY	I sublet while I was going through my divorce. Wait. Surround sound.
CHARLOTTE	I can't believe that men think it takes all this stuff to get a woman into bed.
HARRY	What Does It take? Charlotte.
CHARLOTTE	what?
HARRY	I think you are the sexiest woman I ever met.
CHARLOTTE	"Harry, don't be ridiculous, I'm wearing my glasses."
HARRY	It makes me crazy when You say my name.
CHARLOTTE	Then I'm definitely gonna stop saying it.
HARRY	What a putz your ex-husband must be.
CHARLOTTE	Trey was not a putz.
HARRY	"He was a putz. If I was lucky enough to have you in my bed, I would never take my hands off you."
CHARLOTTE	"Stop, Harry."
HARRY	"Ever since the first moment I saw you, I can't think about anything else. I'm fucking Romeo over here."
CHARLOTTE	"God, it's hot, I'm sweating. Can you open the window?"
HARRY	"I fantasize about your lips, your perfect pink lips."
CARRIE	"Two days, two toilet showers, and too many club sandwiches later..."
IRANDA	Hello?
CARRIE	"It's me, and it's still bad."
IRANDA	The trip or the pimple?
CARRIE	Both. I tried to squeeze it somewhere outside Oklahoma.
CARRIE	Here's a helpful hint: Never give yourself a train facial.
IRANDA	Got it.
CARRIE	"If this thing doesn't deflate by Colorado, I'm not even calling Big. Hold on, someone who used to be Samantha just came in."
SAMANTHA	"Rumor has it a group of guys not resembling the Elephant Man just got on, and are having a bachelor party in the bar car. Get dressed."
CARRIE	I can't go anywhere with this pimple.
SAMANTHA	I got on a train for you. You are going to the bar car with me.
CARRIE	I have to go to a bachelor party.
CARRIE	"And back in New York, Charlotte found herself sandwiched between some confirmed bachelors."
CHARLOTTE	How can a person have really hot S-E-X with someone they don't even like?
ANTHONY	"You're spelling ""sex"" in a place with a go-go boy on the bar?"
CHARLOTTE	I'm serious.
ANTHONY	"Why? Oh, my God, Char. you?"
CHARLOTTE	I don't know what happened. He's my divorce lawyer. I don't even like him!
ANTHONY	Some of the best sex I've had is with people I can't stand. Details. This is so exciting.
CHARLOTTE	He was showing me this bachelor apartment. I think it was all the leather and music.
ANTHONY	"Leather, I get it. Go."
CHARLOTTE	"Suddenly, out of nowhere, we were kissing and then we..."
ANTHONY	"Fucking? Oh, my God, Char! This is so exciting. How was it?"
CHARLOTTE	Unbelievable.
ANTHONY	Cosmos for everyone!
CHARLOTTE	"No, it's not good. I don't want to date him. He's not very attractive."
ANTHONY	Ugly sex is hot.
CHARLOTTE	"No, he's sweaty and pushy. No, I could never date him. But maybe just for the sex. How does that work, exactly?"
ANTHONY	"Okay, listen up. You have to be very clear about the rules. It's just sex. You can't act romantic at all. You have to talk just sex talk. ""Fuck me, and get out."""
CHARLOTTE	Isn't that rude?
ANTHONY	"No, it's hot. Hello! Where's my drink?"
SAMANTHA	Things are looking up. They are pretty cute.
CARRIE	This blush is worse than a pimple. I look like I'm in a high-school play or something.
SAMANTHA	"Come on, follow my lead. Hello. Aren't you boys a sight for sore eyes? So, what are we drinking?"
AN	Light beer.
SAMANTHA	"We can do better than that. Sir, a bottle of champagne, please. I'm sure one of you gentlemen will help me pop my cork."
CARRIE	"And just like that, we went from Some Like It Hot to Some Like Us Not."
SAMANTHA	I thought I was looking pretty hot.
CARRIE	You are pretty hot.
SAMANTHA	not according to them.
CARRIE	Champagne.
SAMANTHA	"Excuse me, but what kind of bachelor party is this?"
AN	"We're not really bachelors. We're all married. Except Bri, he's the last one in the gang to bite it. Yeah, we're taking him to the Giants game in San Francisco."
CARRIE	My friend over there has come on this very long trip as a favor to me and I was hoping that one of you fellows could oblige her in a little harmless male flirtation.
AN	We're trying to be good. Promised our wives.
CARRIE	"As far as a pimp, I was a total train wreck."
CARRIE	They love their wives.
SAMANTHA	"You were right, Carrie. It's not New York that's the problem, it's me. I am having an...The midlife thing, you know."
CARRIE	This thing has roots.
SAMANTHA	"And I don't know what I'm gonna do. I mean, I already fuck younger guys and I don't want a sports car. Oh, God, parking in New York is a bitch."
CARRIE	I'm sorry about the train. This was a terrible idea. It's all my fault. All because I had to get laid. There. Popped it.
SAMANTHA	All right! Let's get another bottle to celebrate.
CARRIE	"One very long trip later, Samantha and I dragged our cabooses into a bookstore near the Golden Gate."
SAMANTHA	Impressive turnout. I guess you are big in San Francisco.
CARRIE	My publisher.
CARRIE	Hi!
LILY	You made It in one piece.
CARRIE	That's debatable. Wow! I can't believe it. All these people came to hear me read?
LILY	They're not all just for you. Mr. Winkle's here.
CARRIE	Who's Mr. Winkle?
LILY	He's making an appearance right after you.
SAMANTHA	You're opening for a dog?
LILY	"They had a chance to get Mr. Winkle, and they jumped at it. He's huge on the Internet."
CARRIE	"Lily, I can't be the opening act for a dog."
LILY	What can I say? The West Coast sales rep totally fucked me on this.
AN	"Lily, hi!"
LILY	"One sec, I'll be right back."
SAMANTHA	"You know, maybe..."
CARRIE	"Thanks, but don't even waste your energy. You know, go back to the hotel, and get in that giant tub and relax. I'll see you later, we'll have a meal."
SAMANTHA	Later? Aren't you going to call Big?
CARRIE	"Between the pimple and the puppy, I'm not up for it."
SAMANTHA	are You sure?
CARRIE	"Yeah, go. take a long bath."
SAMANTHA	I May never get out.
CARRIE	Bye.
CARRIE	This book tour stuff is rough. That's a cute top.
CARRIE	"""As I walked home, I couldn't help but wonder: Was it Big, was it New York or was it me?"" Does anyone have a question? Yes?"
FAN	When is Mr. Winkle coming out?
CARRIE	"In a mere moment. So, if there are no other questions about my book...Yes, I see a hand, but I can't see the man. Could you shift? Sorry."
BIG	"Yes, I have a question. This Big character, does he have a real name?"
CARRIE	"Yes, but I can't reveal it. I have to protect his privacy."
CARRIE	I no longer cared about Mr. Winkle. I had Big.
CARRIE	Samantha!
SAMANTHA	I'm taking a bubble bath.
CARRIE	"You have to get out. Big's here, I need to have sex."
SAMANTHA	I'm taking a bath.
CARRIE	I got You a smaller Room All to yourself downstairs.
SAMANTHA	I can't get in another small room.
CARRIE	Please. I have to get laid.
SAMANTHA	You better fuck him good. I'm not gonna go through this again in another six months.
CARRIE	"Can you hurry? I told him to come up in about half an hour. So, snap it up. Faster. Okay, bye-bye. Thank you, sweets."
CARRIE	"god. Hey, you."
BIG	"So, did You hide the body?"
CARRIE	What body?
BIG	Or whatever it was you had to do that kept me wandering around the hotel gift shop for half an hour. I got you some gum. Big Red. The clerk recommended it.
CARRIE	Aren't you something? Want some?
BIG	Sure.
BIG	Nice digs. this will set your publisher back.
CARRIE	Yeah. You look Good.
BIG	"So do You, kid."
CARRIE	what?
BIG	My gum. Christ. You surprised me. I swallowed it.
CARRIE	"Sorry. Here, let me kiss it and make it all better. How's that?"
BIG	we better go. dinner reservations.
CARRIE	I'm not hungry.
BIG	We have to go. I promised my partners I'd make a vineyard connection with the restaurant owner. So let's go. We'll have a nice meal and catch up.
CARRIE	Okay.
BIG	"So, I'm walking through the mall, and I see your book."
CARRIE	"Wait, you were in a mall?"
BIG	"I live in America now. You've gotta go through them to get to the outside. Anyway, I pass a bookstore, and there you are, right in the window next to the real books."
CARRIE	"Sir, You are Too kind."
BIG	good cover. cute. sexy.
CARRIE	Sexy?
BIG	"So, I go in. I bought it, drove right home, sat on my porch, lit up a cigar, and I read it cover to cover."
CARRIE	Porch?
BIG	Screen doors and everything.
CARRIE	What do you think?
BIG	"I had no idea that I hurt you so much. I gotta say, it was tough to see it in print."
CARRIE	You've read my columns.
BIG	"Not all at one sitting, one reading, one right after the other. I really got how much I hurt you."
CARRIE	"Come on, that's fiction. I embellished."
BIG	"No, some of that stuff really happened. Word for word."
CARRIE	It's just writing. It's all in the past. Let's forget all that and talk about something else. How's the wine business?
BIG	great.
CARRIE	Yeah?
BIG	You know that chapter about my apartment key? Was I really that big of an asshole?
CARRIE	"Oh, my God."
BIG	"""He was like the city itself, cold, infuriating and exhausting."""
CARRIE	"Suddenly, it became clear to me: This was not my best-laid plan."
BIG	"See, that's what I'm talking about. When have I ever been cold? Am I cold?"
CARRIE	No. You're hot. Very hot.
BIG	What about Chapter 3?
CARRIE	That was All years ago. can we Please Stop talking?
BIG	Wait.
CARRIE	what?
BIG	I just don't want you to get hurt again.
CARRIE	I won't. It's just sex.
BIG	"According to this book, it is not just sex."
CARRIE	"What happened in New York was all my fault. I didn't read the signs. You were unavailable, and very clear about that. It was all me. Now, please, kiss me. Or at least lie on top of me."
BIG	"Carrie, I think it's very clear from this book that when it comes to me, you do not have good judgment. Now, look at Chapter 3."
CARRIE	That's fiction. And it's not even a bestseller.
BIG	"Here, page 39."
CARRIE	"Oh, God. I can't believe this is happening. Are you involved with someone else?"
BIG	no.
CARRIE	"It's the pimple, isn't it?"
BIG	I just don't want to do something here that I'll be sorry for later.
CARRIE	I'm fine. Look at me. Put the book down and look at me. I'm fine. Just fine. Don't I look fine?
BIG	"Let's talk just a little more. Now, look, page 39. This part."
HARRY	I love Making love to you.
CHARLOTTE	no. That was not love. That was Just sex.
HARRY	"Charlotte, you are so beautiful. Your skin is so soft. So smooth."
CARRIE	"And you... have a hard dick. Now, put your pants on and go. Is that okay?"
HARRY	Whatever you say.
CARRIE	There they were: The bachelorette and the beast.
HARRY	What about dinner Saturday night?
CARRIE	This is just sex. We're not a couple. You're just...a great fuck. Is that clear?
HARRY	clear.
CARRIE	Hello?
PHONE	"Good morning, it's your wake-up call."
CARRIE	What time is it?
PHONE	0.3125
CARRIE	What time did I say?
PHONE	7:30.
CARRIE	Okay. Thank you.
CARRIE	"After my wake-up call, I got my real wake-up call. Thanks to my book, nothing was ever going to happen with Big."
BIG	Where are you going?
CARRIE	"I have two book readings this morning, before I head back to New York."
BIG	not So fast. come here.
CARRIE	now? What about last night? All That talk? All those concerns?
AR	Fuck it. You'll need material for the sequel.
CARRIE	"""Like that freckle on my face that he once told me he loved. I could do my best to cover it during the day, but at night, after I washed the city off my face, there it was, a tiny brown dot near the tip of my lip. And I wondered how something so small could suddenly seem so big."""
CARRIE	here You go.
FAN	Thank you.
SAMANTHA	Luggage in the car. car at the curb.
CARRIE	Thanks for doing All that.
SAMANTHA	"So, how did It Go with big?"
CARRIE	we had sex.
SAMANTHA	Hallelujah.
CARRIE	"Yeah, but it was not as simple as I had hoped."
SAMANTHA	What does that mean?
CARRIE	The question-and-answer section of this reading is now over. I'll tell you on the train.
SAMANTHA	"Train? Get real. American Airlines, first-class, and some Valium. I cannot wait to get to New York."
CARRIE	What about the midlife crisis?
SAMANTHA	"Honey, who's midlife?"
CARRIE	And sometimes it's not the journey. It's the destination.
CARRIE	"In this ever-expanding galaxy called New York City, there are certain heavenly bodies one orbits around every day. And then there are those stars whose gravitational pull one drifts in and out of over the years."
BOBBY FINE	Is that all there is.
CARRIE	"Bobby Fine, satellite friend, piano bar legend."
BOBBY FINE	"I usually do this number at home in a pink caftan and a Peggy Lee wig. Like you've never done the same thing after three daiquiris? But right now, I must take a quick break to say hello to a celebrity friend. Is there any other kind? Little Miss Carrie Bradshaw."
CROWD	Wonderful.
BOBBY FINE	"She writes books. You remember books. Primitive versions of the DVD. Stop, please stop. Okay, one more time for the cheap seats in the back. Is that all there is. Yes, that's all there is."
IRANDA	How long have you two known each other?
BOBBY FINE	"Let's put it this way. Cats was just Kittens. Cats, the musical. Hello?"
CHARLOTTE	"Oh, I loved Cats."
BOBBY FINE	Medic.
CARRIE	"It hasn't been that long, has it?"
BOBBY FINE	"Please, darling, when we met, you took aerobics and Stanford had hair."
BITSY	Bobby.
BOBBY FINE	Bitsy. I thought You had a dinner.
BITSY	"Oh, I do. The driver is circling, but I had to run up and say hello. Oh, hello."
BOBBY FINE	"Bitsy Von Muffling. This is Carrie, Miranda, Samantha, and the one who liked Cats."
SAMANTHA	"Bitsy, Samantha Jones. I did PR for your museum benefit."
BITSY	"Samantha, of course, I loved you. I was just so thrilled that someone actually liked Cats."
CHARLOTTE	I didn't like it that much.
BOBBY FINE	"Waiter, sense of humor, Table 5."
BITSY	"So, Samantha, how are you?"
SAMANTHA	Fabulous. how are you?
BITSY	Delirious. I'm madly in love and getting married. Big Hamptons wedding.
SAMANTHA	Congratulations. Who's the lucky stud?
BOBBY FINE	me.
CARRIE	You're getting married?
BOBBY FINE	Can you believe it? Bitsy and I are affianced. I finally found the right girl. Mr. Broadway has to go tinkle before he can tinkle.
BITSY	"Samantha, I have your address. You have to come. Nice meeting You all."
SAMANTHA	Bye.
CHARLOTTE	I thought he was gay.
IRANDA	"Yeah, ""Mr. Broadway has to go tinkle""? That's the gayest sentence ever uttered."
SAMANTHA	He must be marrying her for the money.
CARRIE	He doesn't need the money. He was one of the original investors in Chorus Line.
IRANDA	"Just when you thought you'd never hear anything gayer than ""Mr. Broadway has to go tinkle."""
CHARLOTTE	Why would he be getting married?
CARRIE	"In 1988, Bobby Fine announced that he was going to sell his piano bar downtown and go volunteer with Nicaraguan orphans. The orphans are still waiting. This wedding will never happen."
CARRIE	It's happening.
SAMANTHA	Everything's booked. So the really big question is where are we going to stay?
CARRIE	"That's the really big question? What about, ""Why are these two people marrying each other?"" Is that all there is?"
CHARLOTTE	Bitsy said they were madly in love.
IRANDA	"You see, I find the love facade the most offensive part. We're adults. We can handle it. Bitsy should say, ""I'm getting older, and I want companionship."" Or Bobby should say, ""The hot men don't go for me anymore."" But don't print invitations and call it love as if love transforms people and changes molecules 'cause that's bullshit."
CARRIE	I guess you don't want to be my date then.
SAMANTHA	"No dates, Unless they have summer houses."
CARRIE	Relax. We can stay with Stanford and Marcus.
SAMANTHA	I was a fool to break up with Richard before Labor Day. He has a fabulous house.
IRANDA	I wouldn't go to this charade if you paid me. It's like there's a pink suede elephant in the middle of the room and nobody's allowed to talk about it.
CHARLOTTE	You think they won't have sex?
SAMANTHA	All married couples stop having sex eventually.
IRANDA	That's not true. You've had sex with lots of married people.
SAMANTHA	That's how I know.
CARRIE	"Okay, let's say it's companionship. How do you sustain a relationship without the zsa zsa zsu?"
CHARLOTTE	The what?
CARRIE	"That butterflies-in-your-sTomach thing that happens when you not only love the person, but you gotta have them. Isn't that what gets you through the years? Even if it fades, at least you have the memory of the zsa zsa zsu."
IRANDA	I'm fine with whatever people want to do. Just be straight with me.
CARRIE	I think that's how Bitsy proposed to Bobby.
CARRIE	It was right about then Charlotte decided to be straight with us.
CHARLOTTE	"I'm seeing someone, sort of."
CARRIE	"You're in a ""sort of"" relationship?"
CHARLOTTE	It's ridiculous. He's so not my type.
IRANDA	is he heterosexual?
CHARLOTTE	"Yes. But he's bald and short, and he talks with his mouth full. I don't even want to be seen in public with him. I hate his name, Harry, because he is, everywhere but his head."
SAMANTHA	"is the sex bad, too?"
CHARLOTTE	It's the best sex of my life. I think I might really like him.
HARRY	You want to go to a wedding in the Hamptons in a few weeks? Bitsy Von Muffling's.
CHARLOTTE	You're invited to that?
HARRY	"Oh, yeah, I handled her divorce."
CHARLOTTE	I just never thought of you as a Hamptons type.
HARRY	"I am the Hamptons, baby. I own a house in Bridge."
CHARLOTTE	"Well, I can't go. I'm not really ready for swimsuit season."
HARRY	What? You're a fucking knockout.
CHARLOTTE	It's you. It's your back.
HARRY	What's wrong with my back?
CHARLOTTE	It's very hairy. You're not supposed to be able to grab someone's back.
HARRY	this is how I was born. What am I supposed to do about it?
CHARLOTTE	get It waxed.
HARRY	"I'll tell you what. You come with me to the wedding, and I will get my back waxed."
CHARLOTTE	Fine.
HARRY	"come here, you."
CHARLOTTE	your hands are All greasy.
CARRIE	"That night, I thought about what it takes to make a relationship work till death do us part. Most singles have more long-term success with friends. So maybe it is a better strategy to marry a friend. However, in the absence of sex, whether that's the arrangement, or just what happens after a few years, what distinguishes this companion from your many other companions? When it comes to saying ""I do"", is a relationship a relationship without the zsa zsa zsu? Or in Samantha's case, how much is a woman due for surviving the zsa zsa zsu?"
RICHARD'S VOICEMAIL	This is Richard. You have 30 seconds.
SAMANTHA	"I've been thinking. Our pathetic relationship is as close to marriage as either one of us ever hopes to get. So I feel I deserve some sort of settlement. Like, say, a weekend at your house in the Hamptons. You're not invited. I'll be having a party. You're not invited to that either. It's Samantha. Call me."
CARRIE	"A couple of weeks later, another couple of exes were working out their summer share."
IRANDA	Hi. how You doing?
STEVE	Hey. me and Brady were Just napping.
IRANDA	I miss napping. They look down on napping at work. It's so hot out.
STEVE	I was going to give him one more bottle before I left.
IRANDA	I can do it.
STEVE	"I know, But I like it. It used to be All breasts. not me and him. we got our bottle thing."
IRANDA	did Magda bring those?
STEVE	"No, I did. Nice garden in Queens."
IRANDA	Lilacs.
STEVE	Yeah. good flowers.
CARRIE	"Miranda wasn't sure if it was the smell of the lilacs, the smell of the baby, or the smell of Steve's skin. But that afternoon, Steve went from ex to sex."
IRANDA	I slept with Steve.
CARRIE	"Miranda admitted they were somewhere between friends and lovers, somewhere between Manhattan and the Hamptons."
CARRIE	That's why you decided to participate in the charade. You're fleeing.
IRANDA	"I'm a fucking fugitive, literally."
CARRIE	Perhaps It was the zsa zsa zsu.
IRANDA	"No. It was an itch which we shouldn't have scratched, because now we're into a gray area. Not having sex was the only thing holding us together."
CARRIE	You're fleeing to the right wedding. I think that's the theme.
IRANDA	"Seriously. You can't have a kid with someone, and get along and have great sex without giving the wrong impression."
CARRIE	"That being what, that you're happy?"
SAMANTHA	"Fabulous. Absolutely. Yeah, bring them along. I look forward to seeing you, too. This party is going to be amazing. Strictly A list."
CARRIE	are we Still invited?
SAMANTHA	Yes. But shitty-pants There is not.
IRANDA	I have to bring him. I wouldn't be able to find a sitter.
SAMANTHA	He's ruining my lunch. He's not ruining my party. No babies.
CARRIE	"Evidently, there's already a party pooper. Ketchup."
JACK	Carrie?
CARRIE	Yeah. Hi.
JACK	Jack.
CARRIE	"Berger. I know, I remember."
JACK	"What's going on here, are you okay? Do I need to make a tourniquet out of a hotdog bun and a twig?"
CARRIE	"No, it's just... -"
JACK	Ketchup.
CARRIE	Yeah. Thanks. I didn't figure you for a motorcycle guy.
JACK	Turns out I'm not. I bought it as a reaction to my breakup.
CARRIE	It was exactly what I wanted. A Berger with a side of single.
CARRIE	You look good on it.
JACK	"No. I look good next to it. On it, I look like this. I'm not even really hungry. I pulled over because you know, a bug hit my visor, and my hands are still shaking."
CARRIE	"So you're ""uneasy rider."" Well, if you make it to the Hamptons, my friend is having a party Tomorrow afternoon. It's at Richard's house."
JACK	I heard about that. That's quite a place. I pass it on the way to my house. I'm going to get a soda. My throat's kind of dry from all the screaming inside my helmet. It's nice to see you.
CARRIE	"Yeah, you, too, Berger. Maybe I'll see you Tomorrow."
JACK	"Yeah. If you don't, call the Highway Patrol."
CARRIE	Yeah.
CARRIE	Definitely zsa zsa zsu.
CARRIE	"The next morning, Samantha prepared her borrowed beach house for the big bash."
SAMANTHA	I want half the tables set up near the house and the others near the pool. Ladies.
SAMANTHA	"Cassandra, did You bring my tote?"
GIRL	"Shit, where are my Merits?"
SAM	"Ladies, excuse me. Hi. The wait staff is to change in the guest cottage down near the entrance. Aren't you here to waitress?"
GIRL 2	We go to restaurants. We don't work in them.
GIRL  	Where's Richard?
SAMANTHA	Richard? He isn't here. I've got the house this weekend. Excuse me. Where are you going?
GIRL	Richard told us we could hang by the pool whenever.
SAM	You can't pool-hang today. I'm having a party at 3:00.
GIRLS	We'll be fried by then. I have no cell reception at all.
CARRIE	Miranda brought the kid. Don't say anything.
IRANDA	"I know you didn't want babies, but he's in Ralph Lauren and I stuck a cork up his ass, so it'll be okay."
SAMANTHA	This is supposed to be an A-list party.
CARRIE	Then who's the Double-D list by the pool?
SAMANTHA	They won't leave. They say Richard lets them hang out here on weekends. Fucking freeloaders.
CARRIE	People in glass houses...
SAMANTHA	I am not freeloading. I went through a lot with Richard. And people should be rewarded for not getting married as well.
CARRIE	"Frankly, I don't know why you broke up with him. What's a little lying and cheating compared to a pool with a little cabana?"
IRANDA	"Did you say ""no babies,"" or ""no boobies""?"
CARRIE	Lady? And Brady?
CHARLOTTE	That is so inappropriate.
HARRY	Greetings from Silicone Valley.
CHARLOTTE	People can hear you.
HARRY	"What, like everyone here can't see those tits are fake? Everyone can see those tits are fake."
CHARLOTTE	"Would you stop saying ""tits""? Why are you wearing that shirt? Tropical shirts are out."
HARRY	This is not tropical. It's Tiki.
CHARLOTTE	"Well, please Tiki it off."
HARRY	I thought you'd never ask.
CHARLOTTE	"Oh, my God! Your back! You must've had a bad reaction to the waxing."
HARRY	"Yeah, I thought it felt a little itchy. Suddenly a little hair isn't looking so bad?"
BITSY	"Carrie, woman to woman, the sex is amazing. I've never had a man make me feel this way."
BOBBY FINE	"Hush, Miss Scarlett, how you do go on. Well, who ordered the Adonis?"
STANFORD	"Bobby, Bitsy, this is my boyfriend, Marcus."
BOBBY FINE	"For God's sake, man, get yourself to a gym once in a while. Look at that body. It's disgusting! Wow! I could grate cheese on your abs. One large pizza, and hold the salami. Please, put a shirt on before I marry you."
BITSY	No! I haven't touched a carbohydrate in three months. I've got to fit into that dress.
BOBBY FINE	Please eat something. Would you look at her? She's ltsy-Bitsy.
BITSY	"Bobby, I see the Talcotts. We've got to say hello. See you all Tomorrow."
CARRIE	Bye.
CARRIE	"I swear, and I'm totally serious, I almost fainted when he mimed grated cheese on Marcus."
STANFORD	It is so obvious that he wanted him.
CARRIE	Try to keep up. Bobby is straight.
STANFORD	Right.
CARRIE	What is she doing?
ARCUS	Maybe he just makes her laugh.
CHARLOTTE	Can't you wait till we sit down to eat? It's so crass.
HARRY	Question. Is there anything about me today that doesn't bug you?
CHARLOTTE	People are trying to eat. You should have your shirt on. And you have sauce on your face.
HARRY	Now so do you.
CARRIE	Why did she need to tell me the sex was amazing?
SAMANTHA	"Because it is amazing. She's amazed he's able to get hard without another penis in the room. And speaking of dicks, do you think Richard slept with any of those cocoa-butter bitches?"
CARRIE	No! I'm sure they're just good friends. God! How do I look?
SAMANTHA	You look great.
CARRIE	Jesus! Where's a mirror?
SAMANTHA	here.
CARRIE	"Great. All right, put it down. It's okay. Thanks for having a party."
CARRIE	how long have You had a house here?
JACK	Three years.
CARRIE	"Moments later, among the butterflies, I felt butterflies."
JACK	There's a really nice garden
CARRIE	". So, you garden?"
JACK	"No. I have been known to hoe, but my ex actually planted the garden so we could enjoy fresh summer salads. We didn't quite make it to the summer. So it's more fresh pain than fresh vegetables. Yeah. I can't really go out there."
CARRIE	I know how you feel. When I broke up with my ex. I couldn't bring myself to go within six blocks of his furniture store.
JACK	When did you two break up?
CARRIE	"Last year, for the second time. We broke up the first time the year before that."
JACK	You broke up twice. Way to go.
CARRIE	"Yeah, well, we hadn't sufficiently hurt each other enough the first time round. But we definitely took care of business this time. Because this time, he moved in, so we had the merging of the things..."
JACK	Right.
CARRIE	"...the dividing of the things, the things that are left behind that you don't want to get back because that seems mean, and you don't want to throw them away because it's all you have left. It gets harder as we get older because we're not dating wildly inappropriate people anymore. You know, there's no ""Glad that's over."""
JACK	Right.
CARRIE	"After every breakup I tell myself I'm not doing this again. It's too hard. I mean, how many of these things can one person survive? You know, they should institute a helmet law for relationships."
JACK	Right. That's excellently put.
CARRIE	Thank you.
JACK	"I should get going. It's going to take me six hours to drive the two miles home, so...My jacket."
CARRIE	Sorry. Gee. I hope there aren't grass stains.
JACK	"No. It's old. Okay, bye."
CARRIE	Bye.
CARRIE	"The man could not get away from me fast enough. Apparently, it's a short road from commisery to misery."
CARRIE	Are you okay?
SAMANTHA	Perfect! Everything's going out right on time.
GIRL	There's no Tab in here.
SAMANTHA	What are You doing in my refrigerator?
GIRL	It's Richard's refrigerator.
SAMANTHA	I stocked it.
GIRL	Did you see any Rice Krispie treats? Richard usually leaves those around for us.
SAMANTHA	"No, I didn't. And those lemons are for the drinks. Drinks I paid for."
GIRL	Whatever.
SAMANTHA	"And I also paid for the food. In fact, The only thing at this party that you two actually paid for are your breasts!"
GIRL	Jealous?
SAMANTHA	Yes. I'm jealous. I'm just dying to look like this.
GIRL	"Maybe if you did, you'd be out here with Richard. Snap!"
CARRIE	"Evidently, people who borrow glass houses shouldn't throw cantaloupes."
CARRIE	"The next morning, while Stanford and Marcus had Brady, Miranda and I had brunch."
IRANDA	how about these muffins?
CARRIE	how about these Eggs?
IRANDA	how about these napkins?
CARRIE	how about these plates?
IRANDA	how about we marry gay guys?
CARRIE	How about maybe now I won't have a choice?
IRANDA	was It really That bad?
CARRIE	"Bye-Bye, Berger."
CARRIE	"One minute we were laughing, the next minute he had to get away from me so fast, he left skidmarks. Seriously. I can show them to you."
IRANDA	"Jam, please."
CARRIE	"I know what I did. I revealed too much, too soon. I was emotionally slutty."
IRANDA	That's not like you.
CARRIE	It wasn't me. It was the zsa zsa zsu. It makes me crazy. Bitsy Von Muffling Fine may have the right idea. Maybe we should stop looking for a great relationship and settle for a fine one.
IRANDA	I'd marry Steve in a second if he were gay. Everything would be so easy.
CARRIE	"So, a gay area is better than a gray area?"
IRANDA	Yeah. more coffee. You want some? Great coffee.
STANFORD	Tell me something I don't know. What?
CARRIE	"You did it, Stany. Great man, great house, great relationship. We've all been looking, and you actually found it."
STANFORD	Marcus and I haven't had sex since we bought the Cynthia Rowley china.
CARRIE	Thank God! I am so relieved.
BOBBY FINE	"Bitsy Von Muffling, the first time I saw you, I fell in love. You walked in wearing that red vintage Dior."
IRANDA	Pink elephant in the room.
STANFORD	Do you mind? I am listening to the bride and bride.
BITSY	My dear Bobby Fine...
SAMANTHA	"Something tells me Bitsy isn't doing ""Fine."""
HARRY	And that's the little piece of information she's been Von Muffling.
BITSY	"You are there for me in the morning, and there for me at night, there in the good, there in the bad, there in my thoughts, there in my dreams, but most of all, my darling, you are there in my heart forever."
CARRIE	"Perhaps we were all much too cynical. Perhaps, somehow, despite the odds, Bobby and Bitsy had found something real."
OFFICIANT	I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride.
CARRIE	"One more time, for the cheap seats at the back."
CARRIE	Looks like somebody over here is about to dance.
IRANDA	I think you may have sold this one a little short.
CARRIE	"Me, too."
CARRIE	"With a little time and the right astringents, who knows?"
HARRY	"There's nothing on my face, nothing in my teeth. I'm sure you'll hate my moves on the dance floor but that is the risk that every man must take."
CARRIE	What a beautiful night. It's too bad I blew my only chance at a boyfriend this year.
IRANDA	You want to hold my boyfriend?
CARRIE	"I think I'm going to drown my sorrows in another piece of cake. And if anybody asks, I had two, not three."
IRANDA	"You smell that, Brady? It's lilac. Should we call Daddy and tell him we miss him?"
STEVE'S ANSWERING MACHINE	"It's me, Steve. I'm not here. Leave a message."
BOBBY FINE	Do you believe this wedding? Funny where life has taken us. I remember when we went to these things just for the free food.
CARRIE	I have dinner rolls in my purse.
BOBBY FINE	"There's my song. And there's my girl, whom I love. In case you had any money riding on it."
CARRIE	Not a penny.
IRANDA	"Look out, she's got a piece of fruit, and she's not afraid to throw it."
SAMANTHA	Can we not talk about that?
IRANDA	"Okay. But we'll be the only ones here. Look, I'm just glad Brady wasn't the biggest baby at the party."
SAMANTHA	"I guess I went a little crazy, being at Richard's house around his party-crashing pussy posse. What do you call zsa zsa zsu gone bad?"
IRANDA	Zsa zsa eww.
SINGER	Then I fell in love with the most wonderful boy in the world
BOBBY FINE	"Bitsy, honey, everything was perfect."
BITSY	It was. Except for the dessert. The top layer of the crme brule just wasn't hard enough.
STANFORD	"Yeah, that's the problem with this wedding. The crme brule isn't hard enough."
SINGER	"And then one day, he went away, and I thought I would die. But I didn't. And when I didn't, I said to myself, is all that there is to life?"
JACK	I'm not technically crashing. I was having lunch in town today and for some reason the groom invited me. Shall we?
CARRIE	Sure.
HARRY	what? now You want me to wax my eyebrows?
CHARLOTTE	I think I May be falling in love with you.
HARRY	I've been falling for you since the moment we met. But I never thought...
CHARLOTTE	what?
HARRY	"Come on, you could have any blue-blooded guy here. I'm..."
CHARLOTTE	You're wonderful.
HARRY	and Jewish.
CHARLOTTE	So?
HARRY	"So, where can this go?"
CHARLOTTE	I don't know. Let's find out.
HARRY	Charlotte. I have to marry a Jew.
CHARLOTTE	"She can marry a gay guy, and you can't marry an Episcopalian? What do we do now?"
HARRY	I don't know. Dance?
CARRIE	"Apparently, Charlotte had a zsa zsa Jew."
JACK	You're awful quiet.
CARRIE	and I intend to Stay That way.
JACK	No. You were fine. I just wasn't sure if I was up for all that again. Then I thought...
CARRIE	Then you thought what?
JACK	Maybe we should go out on a date before we break up.
CARRIE	"When it comes to relationships, maybe we're all in glass houses and shouldn't throw stones. Because you can never really know. Some people are settling down. Some people are settling. And some people refuse to settle for anything less...than butterflies."
CARRIE	When you live in the city that never sleeps it comes as a bit of a shock when somehow you manage to oversleep.
CARRIE	Taxi! Excuse me.
CARRIE	Taxi! Thank you.
CARRIE	"Shit! Sir, I have to be downtown in 30 minutes."
CARRIE	Thank you.
CARRIE	Keep the change.
DRIVER	I thought that you need a lift.
CARRIE	Excuse me.
CARRIE	Hi.
CARRIE	Which way to the stock exchange?
AN ON STREET	There.
CARRIE	Thank you.
CARRIE	Excuse me.
SECURITY GUARD	Step forward.
CARRIE	Okay.
SECURITY GUARD	Stop.
SECURITY GUARD	Give him the bag.
CARRIE	"Here, can you hold that? Let's go."
SECURITY GUARD	Stop.
SECURITY GUARD	Arms.
CARRIE	I'm sorry.
CARRIE	"Sir, can you hurry? I'm here to ring the bell."
SECURITY GUARD	Go ahead.
CARRIE	"Okay, Thank you."
SECURITY GUARD	Step forward.
NYSE OFFICIAL	"All right, you have to put this on."
NYSE OFFICIAL	And we gotta hurry up.
2ND NYSE OFFICIAL	"Today, one of New York's favorite newspapers the New York Star is going public."
2ND NYSE OFFICIAL	And here to open trading is one of its favorite columnists Carrie Bradshaw.
2ND NYSE OFFICIAL	Now you can press it.
CARRIE	The day after the stock market I met the ladies for lunch in the fashionable Meat Market.
CARRIE	It was so exciting.
CARRIE	It almost made me want to invest in something.
SAMANTHA	I love the stock market.
SAMANTHA	"A room full of screaming, sweating men all trying to get it up."
IRANDA	I don't invest anymore.
IRANDA	It's too volatile.
CARRIE	Exactly.
CARRIE	I like my money right where I can see it.
CARRIE	Hanging in my closet.
CHARLOTTE	"Actually, your stock is up."
CHARLOTTE	I bought shares of your newspaper yesterday.
CARRIE	"Really? Thank you, sweetie."
CARRIE	Was it expensive?
CHARLOTTE	"No, you're cheap."
CARRIE	I never
WAITER	Ladies.
SAMANTHA	Thank you.
IRANDA	$20 for a hamburger? That's reasonable.
SAMANTHA	Pathetic.
SAMANTHA	When I moved to this neighborhood the only thing that cost $20 was a hand job from a tranny.
SAMANTHA	I'm serious.
SAMANTHA	It's all gotten so sanitary.
SAMANTHA	I mean no smoking in bars.
SAMANTHA	What's next? No fucking in bars?
IRANDA	"Well, first there would have to be a no-fucking section."
SAMANTHA	"I mean, just look at this street."
SAMANTHA	"Stella McCartney, Alexander McQueen."
SAMANTHA	The only designer name that belongs in the Meatpacking District is Oscar Mayer.
CARRIE	I never liked his clothes.
CARRIE	Too fatty.
CHARLOTTE	But that's what's great about New York.
CHARLOTTE	There's always a new neighborhood or restaurant
CARRIE	A new man.
CARRIE	That's right.
CARRIE	"Friday night, my first official date with Jack."
CHARLOTTE	That is so exciting.
CHARLOTTE	Isn't that exciting?
IRANDA	It's all fun and games till someone has a child.
SAMANTHA	"So, what do you two have planned?"
CARRIE	He hasn't said yet.
CARRIE	So many outfits need to be scouted.
IRANDA	You kids today and your dating.
CARRIE	I know.
CARRIE	I feel like a girl of 35 again.
CARRIE	I really like him.
CHARLOTTE	Then you better find out his bottom line right up front.
CHARLOTTE	If Harry had told me he could only be serious about me if I were Jewish I doubt I'd be in my situation.
SAMANTHA	I don't get it.
SAMANTHA	What kind of man passes up pussy for Purim?
HARRY 	Soup and a tenderloin of pork.
HARRY 	What's with the face? -
CHARLOTTE	I didn't make a face.
HARRY 	"I said pork, You went"
CHARLOTTE	It's just I'm confused.
CHARLOTTE	"You can order pork, but you can't get serious about our future because I'm not Jewish."
CARRIE	And from the meat market to the marriage market.
HARRY 	"Charlotte, it doesn't work that way."
HARRY 	I'm not kosher.
HARRY 	I'm conservative.
CHARLOTTE	"I'm conservative, too."
HARRY 	My conservative doesn't have anything to do with wearing pearls.
HARRY 	"Look, I know what you're thinking, okay? ""Why did I let things get this far without talking about this? ""Why did I sleep with you or even kiss you?"""
CHARLOTTE	Why did you?
HARRY 	"Because I couldn't not kiss you. Not sleep with you, not see you."
HARRY 	"Believe me, I never thought a shiksa goddess like you would fall for a putz like me."
CHARLOTTE	You're not a putz.
HARRY 	"Do you even know what ""putz"" means?"
CHARLOTTE	"Yes, schmuck."
HARRY 	Sure you're not Jewish?
CARRIE	And from Jewish to pooish.
STEVE	You got a little doody on your forehead.
IRANDA	What? Where? No.
STEVE	Now you got more.
STEVE	The other side.
IRANDA	Which side? Help! It's not funny.
IRANDA	Baby-wipe me.
IRANDA	Get it off!
STEVE	"""Baby-wipe me."""
IRANDA	""" I did not say it like that."
IRANDA	Just get it off.
STEVE	"""Baby-wipe me."
IRANDA	""" Let's see how you like it."
STEVE	
STEVE	What?
IRANDA	I don't think it's funny. You weren't the one with shit on your face.
STEVE	You were chasing me.
IRANDA	I don't have time for this.
IRANDA	I have to get up early.
IRANDA	I don't know why you're here.
IRANDA	You dropped off the baby hours ago.
IRANDA	I don't have time to stand around while you read the paper and order food in Don't you have a life?
STEVE	I got a life.
IRANDA	"Bye, Brady."
IRANDA	I'm in love with Steve.
IRANDA	Hold this.
CARRIE	"Oh, my God, I can't believe it."
IRANDA	"Come on, are you seriously telling me you didn't know?"
CARRIE	I knew. I just can't believe you admitted it.
IRANDA	I need a drink.
IRANDA	What have you got?
CARRIE	It's 11:30 on a Saturday morning.
IRANDA	Did you not hear me just say I was in love with Steve? I think I got an old bottle of KahlÃºa somewhere.
CARRIE	I think I got an old bottle of KahlÃºa somewhere.
CARRIE	"Okay, hold on there, Brady."
CARRIE	Mama needs a cocktail.
IRANDA	"Last night, we were in the dining room, and we were laughing."
IRANDA	"All of a sudden, I looked over at him and I realized we belong together."
IRANDA	So I picked a fight and threw him out of my apartment.
CARRIE	Good thinking.
CARRIE	These Triscuits have been here since the mid-'80s.
IRANDA	I so cannot be in love with Steve.
IRANDA	Steve so is not the guy for me.
CARRIE	Miranda
IRANDA	You're right.
IRANDA	Steve so is the guy for me.
CARRIE	"No, I was just asking if Brady can eat crackers yet."
IRANDA	No.
IRANDA	How can I have been wrong all these years?
CARRIE	You weren't wrong. It just took you a while to get here.
CARRIE	What are you gonna do?
IRANDA	I don't know. I have a lot invested in this relationship.
IRANDA	plus we have the baby.
CARRIE	plus You said You were in love with him.
CARRIE	So how are you gonna tell him?
IRANDA	Maybe I should take him somewhere romantic where I can't start a fight.
CARRIE	"My God, Miranda."
CARRIE	Do you know what this means? You're asking Steve out on a date.
LEATHER DUDES	"Hi, Samantha."
SAMANTHA	Hiya.
LEATHER DUDES	"You're looking good, Sam."
CARRIE	"That night, as Samantha walked home past her friendly neighborhood bar, the Rampole she saw something truly upsetting."
SAMANTHA	Just what we need: Another Wall Street asshole with money.
SAMANTHA	"Hold the door! Hi, thanks."
SAMANTHA	I live here.
SAMANTHA	"See, here are my keys."
CHIP KILKENNY	Chip Kilkenny.
CHIP KILKENNY	I've just moved in.
SAMANTHA	Samantha Jones.
SAMANTHA	3F.
CHIP KILKENNY	I'm 4F.
CHIP KILKENNY	You're right under me.
SAMANTHA	That sounds promising.
SAMANTHA	That's quite a car.
SAMANTHA	I love a nice Hummer.
SAMANTHA	Good night.
CARRIE	"And uptown, in a slightly less obvious maneuver -"
HARRY 	I'm close.
CHARLOTTE	
HARRY 	No! God!
CARRIE	"The next morning, bright and early"
CHARLOTTE	Good morning.
HARRY 	There's a happy face.
CHARLOTTE	I am a happy face.
CHARLOTTE	"It's a beautiful morning, and the sun is shining."
CHARLOTTE	And you changed your mind about the Jewish thing.
HARRY 	What Jewish thing? When? last night.
CHARLOTTE	I asked you if it was that important to you and you said no.
HARRY 	I did?
CHARLOTTE	"Yeah. When we were making love, right before you came."
CHARLOTTE	How could you not remember?
HARRY 	"Charlotte, honey, I can't remember my own name right before I come."
CHARLOTTE	That's what you said.
HARRY 	Asking me to renounce Judaism during sex is a clear manipulation.
CHARLOTTE	"Blah, blah, blah! I just don't understand."
CHARLOTTE	Why is it so important to you?
HARRY 	I promised my mother I would marry a Jew.
CHARLOTTE	Your mother?
CARRIE	Charlotte had had her fill of potential husbands and their demanding mothers.
CARRIE	Harry's stock suddenly began to plummet.
HARRY 	Right before she died.
CARRIE	"And just like that, it was up again."
CHARLOTTE	I'm very sorry your mother is no longer with us because if she met me
HARRY 	She'd fall in love with you like I did and not care? No.Jews don't think like that.
HARRY 	Keeping tradition alive was very important to her.
HARRY 	She lost family in the Holocaust. What?
CHARLOTTE	Now I can't say anything because you've brought up the Holocaust.
"ANSWERING MACHINE (CARRIE'S)
"	"Hi, it's me."
"ANSWERING MACHINE (CARRIE'S)
"	Leave a message.
JACK	"Hi, it's Jack."
JACK	"Berger, not Kerouac."
JACK	I wanted to clear that up.
JACK	"So, you're probably standing there screening."
JACK	Way to play it.
JACK	I'm a big fan of the screen.
JACK	"In fact, don't pick up or I'll just I'll panic and hang up."
JACK	Don't pick up.
JACK	I'm not ready for actual voice-on-voice action.
JACK	So I'm jumping right in and suggesting dinner and a movie for the big date.
JACK	"Everybody's really been loving that movie, Craig's Room."
JACK	Why don't we go and hate it? Here come the movie times.
JACK	We have 5.
JACK	"15, we have 7."
CARRIE	"And he calculated which times and which theaters would be least crowded, which says, ""take charge."
CARRIE	""" Yet left the restaurant choice to me, which says, ""flexible."
CARRIE	""" All in all, the perfect machine message."
CARRIE	I think Berger and I are going to be very happy together.
CARRIE	I love this time before the first date when you can say things like that and almost believe them.
IRANDA	Why All the drama?
CARRIE	because I really like him.
CARRIE	And you can imagine what that does to a girl.
IRANDA	Got it.
IRANDA	Say no more.
IRANDA	"Really, say no more."
CARRIE	"Right after, I got a message from this other fellow who I've known for a year, suddenly asking me out which only proves my theory: The only thing a girl needs to get a date is another date."
SAMANTHA	Your stock is up.
CHARLOTTE	and did You say Yes?
CARRIE	"No, I already have a date."
CHARLOTTE	Which is why you should say yes to the other one.
CHARLOTTE	You're putting a lot of pressure on this Berger date.
SAMANTHA	Charlotte's right.
SAMANTHA	You need to do something to take the edge off.
CARRIE	I am not going on a simu-date.
CHARLOTTE	How many new outfits have you bought for this movie? Be honest.
CARRIE	None.
CARRIE	Six.
CARRIE	All returnable.
CARRIE	"All right, maybe just a casual coffee to take the edge off Berger."
CHARLOTTE	Exactly.
CARRIE	"Later that day, I got to thinking about the stock market and dating."
CARRIE	"Are they really that different? If you have a bad stock, you can lose your shirt."
CARRIE	"If you have a bad date, you can lose your will to live."
CARRIE	"And if the date is good, the stakes get even higher."
CARRIE	After weathering all the ups and downs you could one day find yourself with nothing.
CARRIE	When it comes to finance and dating I couldn't help but wonder.
CARRIE	"""Why do we keep investing?"" And speaking of high-risk investments"
STEVE	"Hey, it's me."
STEVE	I'm not here.
STEVE	Try me at Scout.
STEVE	957-7297.
STEVE	Don't forget the 212.
IRANDA	"Hi, Steve."
IRANDA	I need to talk to you about something.
IRANDA	How about we do it over dinner? How's tomorrow night? Magda can sit with Brady.
IRANDA	Let me know.
IRANDA	Bye.
IRANDA	It's Miranda and Bye.
CARRIE	Miranda feared it was possibly the most imperfect machine message ever.
CARRIE	And Samantha decided to say it with a basket.
SAMANTHA	Welcome Wagon.
CHIP KILKENNY	Hi.
CHIP KILKENNY	Excuse the towel.
CHIP KILKENNY	I was just gonna shower.
SAMANTHA	I brought you a basket filled with goodies to acquaint you with your new neighborhood.
SAMANTHA	"Cheese, prosciutto, condoms, handcuffs."
CHIP KILKENNY	Handcuffs?
SAMANTHA	from the bar Next door.
SAMANTHA	Enjoy.
CHIP KILKENNY	"If I reach for that, my towel will fall."
SAMANTHA	I'm no fool.
CARRIE	"A little while later, Samantha blew Chip the stockbroker."
CHIP KILKENNY	Yes!
SAMANTHA	Now that's what I call eating in.
CHIP KILKENNY	"I never do this, but here's a tip."
CHIP KILKENNY	Elan Pharmaceuticals is gonna go straight through the roof.
SAMANTHA	Elan Pharmaceuticals.
SAMANTHA	Thanks.
CHIP KILKENNY	"No, Thank you."
CHIP KILKENNY	That was the best F-ing head of my life.
CARRIE	"Just like that, their mutual fun turned into mutual funds."
CARRIE	"Later that week, I met graphic designer Willy Applegate for a late afternoon simu-date."
CARRIE	This is a cute place.
WILLY APPLEGATE	I hope it's okay.
WILLY APPLEGATE	I didn't know.
WILLY APPLEGATE	"But I figured, you can't go wrong with a garden, right?"
CARRIE	"Yeah, it's great."
WILLY APPLEGATE	I hope it's okay.
WILLY APPLEGATE	I didn't know.
WILLY APPLEGATE	I just said that.
CARRIE	It suddenly became clear that a simu-date for me was a first date for him.
WILLY APPLEGATE	Are you looking at my sty?
CARRIE	Excuse me?
WILLY APPLEGATE	My sty. I have a sty.
WILLY APPLEGATE	"See, right here."
WILLY APPLEGATE	"I was gonna cancel, but then I thought: ""Maybe she won't even notice it."
CARRIE	""" I didn't even No, I wasn't looking at it."
WILLY APPLEGATE	That's good.
WILLY APPLEGATE	What was that? Have you ever seen anything like it?
CARRIE	"No, I have never."
WILLY APPLEGATE	This is a bad choice of place.
WILLY APPLEGATE	I'm sorry.
CARRIE	"No, it's fine."
CARRIE	It's fun.
CARRIE	"It's like a ""cappuccino wilderness safari."
WILLY APPLEGATE	""" Balsamic vinegar in my sty."
CARRIE	"God, here."
WILLY APPLEGATE	Thanks.
WILLY APPLEGATE	Could this go any worse? What the fuck? I'm fine.
CARRIE	It was a sudden crash no analyst had seen coming.
CARRIE	And in yet another type of market I hope you're happy now.
CARRIE	I'm twice as nervous about my Berger date.
CARRIE	Caring too much is like a disaster magnet.
CHARLOTTE	Poor guy.
CARRIE	"Can you catch a sty helping someone up from gravel? Where's the homeopathic section? Maybe they make something called ""Sty-B-Gone."
CHARLOTTE	""" Did you know that Elizabeth Taylor converted to Judaism for Eddie Fisher?"
CARRIE	"I'm thrown by the change of topic, but I do appreciate the trivia."
CHARLOTTE	I'm reading her book My Love Affair with Jewelry.
CARRIE	Not surprising.
CHARLOTTE	She changed her religion for the man she loved.
CARRIE	"And a big old, honking piece of jewelry."
CHARLOTTE	Don't be so cynical.
CARRIE	"Sorry, it's my potential sty talking."
CHARLOTTE	Love.
CHARLOTTE	She did it for love.
CARRIE	Are you thinking of pulling an Elizabeth Taylor?
CHARLOTTE	I need more information. There's more to being a Jew than jewelry.
CARRIE	Wise words.
CARRIE	I'll meet you at the checkout.
CARRIE	Charlotte wondered just how far she would go for her true love.
CHARLOTTE	Did you know that Elizabeth Taylor converted to Judaism for Eddie Fisher? Now don't get too excited.
CHARLOTTE	We're just trading information here.
HARRY 	Okay.
HARRY 	"From a not excited place I ask, is this something you might consider?"
CHARLOTTE	I'm just trying to understand what's so special about being a Jew.
HARRY 	I feel like I'm on a game show.
CHARLOTTE	I'm serious.
CHARLOTTE	"If this is really your bottom line, then you're gonna have to try and give me a reason, aside from your mother, that I can relate to."
HARRY 	"If we were to get married Now, we're just trading information here."
HARRY 	I would want our children to be raised Jewish.
CARRIE	Charlotte realized it was time to reveal to Harry her bottom line.
CHARLOTTE	"If that's really the reason, then I have to tell you something."
CHARLOTTE	I may not be able to give you children.
CHARLOTTE	I'm challenged in the reproductive area.
CHARLOTTE	"It's not hopeless, but it's difficult."
CHARLOTTE	"I guess I should have brought it up sooner, but I never thought we'd even I understand if you"
HARRY 	Charlotte.
HARRY 	I love you.
HARRY 	You are the most wonderful thing that could ever happen to a schmuck like me.
CHARLOTTE	You're not a schmuck.
CHARLOTTE	You're a putz.
CHARLOTTE	"Seriously, Harry you want a family and what if I couldn't give that to you?"
HARRY 	We'd adopt or something.
CHARLOTTE	But they wouldn't be your own.
HARRY 	What are you gonna do?
CARRIE	"Charlotte York was deeply touched by Harry's humor, compassion, and acceptance."
CARRIE	"""If this is Jewish,"" she thought, ""that's worth looking into."
CARRIE	""" Meanwhile, downtown, Samantha had moved her neighbor from stocks and bonds to stockings and bondage."
CHIP KILKENNY	Go away.
CHIP KILKENNY	I'm busy.
JUAN	Miss Jones.
SAMANTHA	Juan.
CHIP KILKENNY	who the Fuck are you?
FBI AGENT	FBI. get dressed.
FBI AGENT	You're under arrest for insider trading.
CARRIE	"Turns out, Chip Kilkenny was quite the ladies' man."
CARRIE	"And every time a woman went down, the Dow went up."
FBI AGENT	"Ma'am, can you undo your cuffs so we can use ours?"
SAMANTHA	Surely. All the good ones are getting arrested.
CARRIE	"And at a romantic restaurant, a 37-year-old single mother found herself on a first date."
STEVE	You look pretty.
STEVE	You got a date later?
IRANDA	"No, it's just the dress."
STEVE	"Jeez Louise, it's dark in here."
STEVE	I can barely read my menu.
STEVE	We need like another candle or something.
IRANDA	I think it's kind of nice.
IRANDA	I asked you here because I wanted to explain why I picked a fight with you last week.
STEVE	"Miranda, I know you."
STEVE	And I know why you picked a fight with me.
IRANDA	You do?
STEVE	Yeah. You're upset 'cause I'm hanging around too much.
STEVE	You think I'm getting too close.
STEVE	But you don't have to worry.
STEVE	I just started seeing someone else and it's going really good.
STEVE	So please relax.
STEVE	I'm not in love with you anymore.
IRANDA	All that stuff I said to you about Steve never happened.
IRANDA	Don't mention it to anyone.
IRANDA	Don't think about it.
IRANDA	Don't even so much as give me a look like you might be thinking about it.
IRANDA	Like that look.
IRANDA	"I can't ever, never see that look again."
IRANDA	Calm down.
CARRIE	I think you're overreacting to that thing that never happened.
IRANDA	"If you think I'm overreacting here, you should be inside my head."
CARRIE	I have to say this next thing but I will play along and not look at you while I say it.
CARRIE	Maybe if you had told Steve anyway
IRANDA	"I swear to God, I love you but I will have to kill you."
IRANDA	"Brady, come on."
IRANDA	Work with Mommy here.
IRANDA	Please!
CARRIE	"I'm sorry, but I'm looking and I'm talking."
CARRIE	This is your life.
CARRIE	You two have a baby together.
CARRIE	It is not high school.
IRANDA	Isn't that Berger?
CARRIE	"God, I look like shit!"
IRANDA	You don't look like shit.
CARRIE	I look like shit.
CARRIE	This is not my perfect outfit.
IRANDA	are You leaving?
CARRIE	"Yeah, bye. Oh, God."
CARRIE	Shit! I was just entering the safety zone when There he was.
CARRIE	My emotional equivalent to the big crash of '29.
CARRIE	Aidan.
AIDAN	look at you.
CARRIE	look at you.
AIDAN	I had a baby.
CARRIE	I have a date.
AIDAN	That's wonderful.
CARRIE	This is him?
AIDAN	"No, this isn't him. This is a stunt baby."
AIDAN	"Yeah, it's him."
AIDAN	This is the man: Tate.
AIDAN	"I call him Tater 'cause he looks like one, you know."
AIDAN	"No hair, big eyes."
AIDAN	He's cool.
AIDAN	"Aren't you, Tate? So where are you running to?"
CARRIE	home. So things are good? they look Good.
AIDAN	I'm just hanging out in front of this fabric store waiting for Tate's mom.
AIDAN	"All right, don't laugh."
AIDAN	I married another furniture designer.
CARRIE	Really?
AIDAN	What are you gonna do?
CARRIE	Yep. You can't fight city hall.
AIDAN	Cathy.
AIDAN	She's great.
AIDAN	You Wanna come and meet her?
CARRIE	another time. I really have to run.
AIDAN	Okay.
CARRIE	"Bye, Tate."
CARRIE	"Oh, God, Aidan."
CARRIE	It's good to see you.
AIDAN	"You, too."
AIDAN	We should get together and have coffee sometime and catch up.
CARRIE	Great.
CARRIE	"Okay, we'll do that."
CARRIE	Bye.
CARRIE	There is the type of date you can't wait to keep.
CARRIE	And the type of date you both know you'll never keep.
CARRIE	"A block later, I realized if Aidan and I could survive that huge a crash and both get out alive there was nothing I could do on a first date I couldn't bounce back from."
CARRIE	"Berger, it's Carrie."
CARRIE	"Hi, listen."
CARRIE	I'm standing outside the Sony Theater near Lincoln Center and Craig's Room starts in half an hour.
CARRIE	And there are no lines.
CARRIE	Can you go now?
STEVE	That's so weird. I'm right in that neighborhood.
CARRIE	Really? Must be fate.
STEVE	I'll be right there.
CARRIE	Okay.
CARRIE	Bye.
STEVE	This blows.
STEVE	I had my special outfit all picked out for tonight.
CARRIE	I got the tickets.
STEVE	Then I got the popcorn and the assorted chocolate goodies.
STEVE	are You a candy gal?
CARRIE	I am the candy gal.
STEVE	'Cause I'm a candy man.
CARRIE	Yeah?
STEVE	"No, I am serious."
STEVE	Sammy Davis ripped me off.
CARRIE	Sammy Davis.
CARRIE	You don't feel the need to use the Junior?
STEVE	No. Not at all.
CARRIE	Really?
STEVE	Nope.
CARRIE	"And by close of Wall Street that day the NASDAQ was down, but amazingly, our stock was still up."
CARRIE	The only thing as delicious as those first few bites of a truly great burger are those first few dates with someone truly great like Berger.
JACK	"So I thought, ""That's cool, I'll do a book reading in my hometown."
JACK	""" Right about after the fifth question I realized that my mother is heckling me."
CARRIE	she was not.
JACK	"No, she was."
JACK	Ask anybody at the Downers Grove Barnes & Noble.
JACK	They still talk about it.
JACK	Come here.
CARRIE	Everything is fresh.
CARRIE	Everything is a first.
JACK	You like your beef.
CARRIE	Everything is foreplay.
CARRIE	Even a trip to Bed Bath & Beyond can become an ecstatic errand.
CARRIE	I don't see you as a fish person.
JACK	The problem with the fish is you're into the whole fish theme.
JACK	"You have the fish soap, fish bathmat."
CARRIE	"It's a pyramid scheme, this shower curtain."
JACK	"Now, this is the one I have at home."
JACK	"Except on mine, China's covered in mold."
CARRIE	And here they thought communism was a problem.
CARRIE	"You know, it's a very intimate thing, shopping for shower curtains."
JACK	Yeah? Wait till I get you into bedding.
CARRIE	"And, of course, those first kisses are the greatest kisses in the world."
AN IN RESTAURANT	Good night.
JACK	We should get out of here before they turn the lights off.
CARRIE	The wait staff couldn't wait any longer and neither could I.
CARRIE	"I wanted Berger in my bed, bath, and beyond immediately."
JACK	I'm either leaving a very big tip or a dry cleaning receipt.
CARRIE	my hair.
JACK	Sorry.
JACK	Was that
CARRIE	"No, I just"
CARRIE	"The next night, Samantha convinced us to go to Raw where the scene was hot and the food was not."
CARRIE	You'd think a place that eliminated cooking could eliminate waiting.
IRANDA	"What do you mean? They don't cook the food, here?"
SAMANTHA	That's why they call it Raw.
SAMANTHA	The raw food movement? People love it.
SAMANTHA	"Sting, Demi, Soon-Yi, soon me."
CHARLOTTE	"Now, what is raw food exactly?"
SAMANTHA	"Vegan non-dairy, and nothing is cooked over 118 degrees."
IRANDA	"So, in other words, raw vegetables."
CARRIE	and Sometimes flowers.
IRANDA	and You knew about this?
CARRIE	I read a review in the times.
IRANDA	"where, in the gardening section?"
CHARLOTTE	I heard it's delicious.
IRANDA	"people, the emperor has No oven."
CARRIE	Sorry.
CARRIE	I didn't get enough sleep last night.
SAMANTHA	Really? did You finally bugger Berger?
CARRIE	how long have You been Waiting to say that?
SAMANTHA	It Just occurred to me.
CARRIE	"Yes, we finally buggered."
CHARLOTTE	Yay
IRANDA	You realize you're now applauding intercourse?
CHARLOTTE	"It was her first time, and she really likes him."
HOSTESS	"Jones, your table is ready."
SAMANTHA	"So, details?"
CARRIE	It was Good.
CARRIE	It was Fine.
IRANDA	Fine?
CARRIE	I don't want to talk about it.
SAMANTHA	He couldn't get it up?
CARRIE	He could get it up.
CARRIE	That wasn't the
CARRIE	"You know what, there was no problem."
CARRIE	Moving on.
HOSTESS	Enjoy your meal.
CARRIE	What? I don't want to make a big deal about it.
CARRIE	It was just the first time.
CARRIE	We're so good everywhere else.
CARRIE	"We're great in restaurants, it's like poppity pop-pop."
CARRIE	"And the kisses are great, and then in bed there was no sexual chemistry."
CARRIE	I don't know what happened.
CARRIE	He just
SAMANTHA	Couldn't find your clit?
CARRIE	He knows what he's doing.
SAMANTHA	Then what are we talking about?
CARRIE	It was Just quiet.
CHARLOTTE	"I wouldn't worry about it, Carrie."
CHARLOTTE	"If the kisses were good, the sex will eventually be good."
CARRIE	I'm not worried.
IRANDA	how Quiet was it?
CARRIE	It was so quiet that at one point I heard the M11 bus.
CARRIE	"I heard the doors open, I heard people getting off."
SAMANTHA	At least someone was getting off.
SAMANTHA	And speaking of
SMITH	Welcome to Raw.
SAMANTHA	Hello.
SMITH	We'd like to get you started with a little amuse-bouche.
SAMANTHA	I'd like him to amuse my bouche.
CHARLOTTE	this Just looks delicious.
SMITH	It's our summer vegetable soup.
SMITH	"I see you guys are set for drinks, I'll give you a minute with the menus."
SMITH	Our specials tonight if you're interested
SAMANTHA	I'm extremely interested.
SMITH	Leek papaya patties and zucchini enchiladas.
IRANDA	I'm gonna need a pizza after this.
SAMANTHA	I'm gonna need a napkin to dry off my seat.
SAMANTHA	That waiter was hot.
IRANDA	And the soup is not.
CHARLOTTE	What is this?
IRANDA	"bad, this is bad."
IRANDA	It is like lawn in a bowl.
CARRIE	Maybe some things should be over 118 degrees.
SAMANTHA	"Like sex, for example."
CARRIE	Can we please forget I said anything? Seriously.
CARRIE	Who else has news?
CHARLOTTE	"I do, but you have to put down your menus, because I need your undivided attention."
SAMANTHA	You'll have to shoot our waiter.
SAMANTHA	Will you look at that ass?
CHARLOTTE	Do you mind? I have something a bit shocking to say.
CHARLOTTE	"After I say it, I don't want anyone to react because I'm very happy with my decision."
CHARLOTTE	I'm becoming a Jew.
IRANDA	what?
CHARLOTTE	I can feel You reacting.
CHARLOTTE	"I love Harry very much, and he loves me."
CHARLOTTE	"So, tomorrow, I'm meeting with a rabbi to discuss converting."
SAMANTHA	Isn't that a lot of hoop-jumping for a man?
CHARLOTTE	"Look, Harry is not who I expected to fall in love with, but I did."
CHARLOTTE	"And he makes me laugh, and he says what he means and I feel like I can be myself around him."
IRANDA	But yourself is Episcopalian.
CHARLOTTE	And it is still the most exciting sex I've ever had.
CARRIE	Mazel tov.
IRANDA	"Now, this is food."
IRANDA	You know what's even better? While I'm eating this slice of pizza my boyfriend is home taping my favorite TV show.
CARRIE	and to Which Boyfriend are we referring?
IRANDA	my Boyfriend TiVo.
CARRIE	You've traded Steve-o for TiVo.
IRANDA	We don't talk of Steve-o anymore.
CARRIE	I thought if I changed his name
IRANDA	"Who needs him? With TiVo, when there's something I don't enjoy, I speed right through it."
CARRIE	if Only we Could do That in life.
IRANDA	Exactly.
IRANDA	"He surprises me with things I might like, which is how I got hooked on Jules & Mimi."
CARRIE	I stopped watching TV when people started putting leeches down their pants.
IRANDA	"No, this is BBC America."
IRANDA	It's about a beautiful black man from Brixton and a white woman from Hampstead Heath.
IRANDA	"I don't know what that means, but apparently there's a great divide and he rents the flat above her hat shop and tonight, they're finally having sex."
CARRIE	Good luck to them.
IRANDA	"Carrie, It was the first time."
CARRIE	I know.
IRANDA	and Sometimes You have to work at it.
CARRIE	have You had to work at it?
IRANDA	I'm dating a digital recording device.
CARRIE	I have never had to work at it with someone I really like.
IRANDA	You should probably Keep That to yourself.
CARRIE	"Okay, But, Miranda I got to Tell You, It was not Good."
CARRIE	There was no throw down.
CARRIE	It was more like a slow down.
CARRIE	It caught me completely off guard because I thought it would be amazing.
IRANDA	Maybe that's the problem.
CARRIE	what?
IRANDA	Your expectations were too high.
IRANDA	Of course you were disappointed.
IRANDA	"From now on, people should tell it like it is."
IRANDA	First-time sex: Tricky.
IRANDA	Non-dairy vegan ravioli: Kindergarten paste.
CARRIE	"As I tried to scrub the smell of uncooked okra off me I started thinking about ""sexpectations""."
CARRIE	"We're aware as smart, single women that we can't expect perfection but life still manages to throw us curve balls."
CARRIE	"Maybe once you're into your mid-30s, it shouldn't be called dating."
CARRIE	"It should be called ""Waiting for the other shoe to drop."
CARRIE	""" If it's not the sex between me and you then someone has to become a Jew."
CARRIE	Why is it always something? Unless you're in a problem-free relationship with TiVo.
IRANDA	No.
IRANDA	Maybe later.
IRANDA	Hello.
IRANDA	Shut up.
IRANDA	Thank you.
IMI	"Jules, are you there?"
JULES	"Hello, Mimi."
IMI	Do you always answer the door without your shirt on?
JULES	The heat isn't working.
JULES	That's why I rang you up.
IMI	It seems to be working.
IMI	It's definitely balmy in here.
JULES	The problem is in the bedroom.
IMI	"Right, of course."
IMI	The bedroom.
CARRIE	"The next day, Charlotte boldly went where no York had gone before."
CARRIE	The synagogue.
CHARLOTTE	Shalom.
CHARLOTTE	Where would I find the rabbi?
JANITOR	His study.
JANITOR	Inside.
CHARLOTTE	Thank you.
CHARLOTTE	are You the rabbi?
RABBI MINSCH	Yes.
CHARLOTTE	"Hi, my name is Charlotte York and I'm here today because I would like to consider joining the Jewish faith."
RABBI MINSCH	We're not interested.
CHARLOTTE	Hello.
CHARLOTTE	I need to report a very rude man.
CHARLOTTE	I was saying my name is Charlotte York and I would like to consider joining the Jewish I don't know what is with these people.
CHARLOTTE	I never!
HARRY	"Do you know how much I love you for doing this? Do you know how sexy you look? That's it, I have to have you immediately."
CARRIE	Harry definitely had throw down but Charlotte was too thrown and down to care.
CHARLOTTE	"Stop, Harry."
CHARLOTTE	I'm feeling very rejected by your people.
HARRY	"That's the game, baby."
HARRY	They try to make it hard for you.
CHARLOTTE	what?
HARRY	It's part of the process.
HARRY	"Traditionally, they turn you down three times to make sure you're serious."
CARRIE	Suddenly Charlotte understood.
CARRIE	They were playing hard to get.
CARRIE	They were rules rabbis.
CHARLOTTE	I can play that game.
CHARLOTTE	I invented that game.
CARRIE	No man rejects Charlotte York.
HARRY	I don't care what any rabbi says.
HARRY 	You are my chosen person.
CARRIE	Miranda was looking forward to another perfect night with her perfect boyfriend.
CARRIE	"But unfortunately, there was another woman."
AGDA	I think I did something bad.
IRANDA	What do You mean? Brady? I Just checked on him.
AGDA	"No, boy is Beautiful, is Fine."
IRANDA	TiVo? What did you do? Exactly what did you do? I sit on and then nothing.
IRANDA	You sat on TiVo? Is it okay? Nothing is recorded.
IRANDA	"How could you do this? This is Jules & Mimi, the morning after."
IRANDA	No!
AGDA	Yes.
CARRIE	"And across town, I lay in bed willing Berger to call me which never works."
CARRIE	Hello?
JACK	"Hey, it's me."
JACK	Sorry for not calling earlier.
JACK	"This is the same excuse every guy gives, but in my case it's true."
JACK	A 60-foot raccoon was attacking the village and I had to trap it and kill it and stuff it and everybody's safe now even the little Flanders girl who was stuck in a tree.
JACK	But I might have rabies.
JACK	What have you been up to?
CARRIE	Same old.
CARRIE	"Did The Times crossword puzzle, found a cure for cancer."
JACK	You did The Times crossword puzzle?
CARRIE	"Monday's, not Sunday's."
JACK	Okay.
CARRIE	"I need three people to do Sunday's, one has to have the answers."
CARRIE	"I was thinking that if two people can be good in bed when they're not in the same bed, how hard a conversion could it be?"
CARRIE	I have some answers if You have cab fare.
BIG	Yeah?
SAMANTHA	Dump him.
SAMANTHA	"Fuck me badly once, shame on you."
SAMANTHA	"Fuck me badly twice, shame on me."
CARRIE	Is that the saying?
SAMANTHA	That's my saying.
CARRIE	I don't want to dump him.
CARRIE	I think he's fantastic.
CARRIE	Aren't we getting a little old to jump to the dump?
CARRIE	"What about working on things? Look at Charlotte, she's becoming a Jew."
SAMANTHA	I need something that will make a guy come in his pants as soon as he sees me.
SALES PERSON	Got it.
CARRIE	You talk to sales people like that?
SAMANTHA	I'm here all the time.
SAMANTHA	They love me.
CARRIE	Is this for a specific gentleman or do you just look for that generally?
SAMANTHA	It's for that hot waiter from Raw.
SAMANTHA	"I'm sleeping with him tonight, but he doesn't know it yet."
CARRIE	I think I have to talk to him.
SAMANTHA	No!
CARRIE	we talk about Everything else.
SAMANTHA	"Honey, when it comes to sex, spray it, don't say it."
CARRIE	"Okay, That was unnecessary."
SAMANTHA	I'm trying to salvage your love life.
SAMANTHA	The only words you should be saying in bed are dirty ones.
CARRIE	I can't do that without alcohol.
SAMANTHA	"Then start drinking, because if you want a hotter sex life you're going to have to turn up the heat."
SAMANTHA	Starting with
CARRIE	I don't wear furry shoes.
SAMANTHA	"They're not for you, they're for him."
CARRIE	he Mostly wears Loafers.
CARRIE	Are you sure I can't talk to him about it?
SAMANTHA	"Honey if the sex isn't great, it doesn't help to say it's not great."
SAMANTHA	"That's usually a downer, and by that I mean"
CARRIE	"Plus, he must know it's not great."
CARRIE	He can't think this is good.
CARRIE	"Oh, God."
CARRIE	Is it possible he thinks this is good?
SALES PERSON	Here we are.
SAMANTHA	"As a matter of fact, I'm gonna take this."
CARRIE	We'll take two.
CARRIE	And these in a 7.
CARRIE	That evening Miranda had one of those regrettable discussions that results from the belief that you and your partner should be able to talk through any problem.
IRANDA	We have been over this before.
IRANDA	I feel like you are not listening to me.
IRANDA	I turned the system off for 10 minutes and nothing changed.
IRANDA	I'm sorry.
IRANDA	I'm upset.
IRANDA	I'm just so disappointed.
IRANDA	I got used to coming home to something.
IRANDA	Can't you work with me on this? You told me to do that already.
IRANDA	What is wrong with you?
CARRIE	Friday night with Berger.
CARRIE	I had my sexy lingerie under my cool couture and I was feeling good.
CARRIE	You look so hot in that shirt.
JACK	You being serious?
CARRIE	"Okay, we're gonna need some drinks."
WAITRESS	"It's happy hour, so frozen margaritas are two-for-one."
CARRIE	"All Right, Okay."
CARRIE	When in Rome
JACK	Sure.
CARRIE	"Since we were 0 for two, I figured two-for-one was a good idea."
CARRIE	"And after three unreturned phone calls, Charlotte decided to make a house call."
CHARLOTTE	"Hello, rabbi."
CHARLOTTE	I brought you some kosher wine.
RS. MINSCH	"I'm sorry, but my husband can't see you now."
CHARLOTTE	"Excuse me, I don't mean to be rude, but I think he can."
RS. MINSCH	Miss.
CHARLOTTE	"What I am 37 years old, I'm reproductively challenged."
CHARLOTTE	"I'm in love with a Jewish person, it took me 20 years to find him."
CHARLOTTE	I don't have time to play these games.
RABBI	"All right, Charlotte, lesson number one: You have to give it a rest because it's about to be Sabbath, the day of rest."
RABBI	You want to be a Jew? Sit.
RABBI	Watch.
RABBI	Learn.
CHARLOTTE	That is so sweet.
CHARLOTTE	"But actually, I'm supposed to meet my boyfriend I can skip it."
RS. MINSCH	"Come, girls, gather."
CHARLOTTE	Sorry.
RS. MINSCH	(Jewish prayer)
CHARLOTTE	Amen.
CARRIE	"And Samantha was at Raw, ready to get things cooking."
SMITH	Welcome to Raw.
SAMANTHA	Hello.
SAMANTHA	I was here the other night.
SMITH	That's what happens.
SMITH	"You come once, and you keep coming over and over."
SAMANTHA	Here's hoping.
SMITH	I'll be with you soon.
SMITH	I'm getting slammed.
SMITH	For some reason the hostess keeps seating everyone in my section.
SMITH	Be right back.
CARRIE	Suddenly Samantha realized why the raw food movement was a movement.
CARRIE	Women weren't there for the cold food they were there for the hot waiter.
IRANDA	Sorry.
STEVE	Look who's home.
IRANDA	I got held up at work.
IRANDA	Thanks for filling in.
IRANDA	"Hi, cutie."
IRANDA	Did the TiVo guy come?
STEVE	"No, they called and said that they'd have to reschedule for a week from Thursday."
IRANDA	A week from Thursday?
STEVE	"Yeah, but I played around with a few things, and I think it's okay now."
IRANDA	"What do you mean, it's working?"
STEVE	Yup.
IRANDA	I love you.
IRANDA	"I mean, you know, for fixing that."
STEVE	"Yeah, Magda said it was kind of important."
STEVE	"Listen, I gotta take off."
IRANDA	Hot date?
STEVE	"Yeah, I got this dinner thing."
STEVE	"See you later, champ, all right?"
CARRIE	"Some things, like a broken TiVo, can be repaired."
CARRIE	"And others, like a broken heart, are a little more complicated."
CARRIE	Four hours and four courses of uncooked food later Samantha and her competitors waited it out.
CARRIE	"Maybe they were less horny, maybe it was all that roughage but one by one, women threw in the napkin."
SMITH	Can I get you anything else?
SAMANTHA	"No, I'm just enjoying my delicious mushroom tea."
SMITH	Okay.
SMITH	did You want Anything else?
CUSTOMER	You know what? I Would like to have some Of That key lime custard.
CUSTOMER	It sounds too good to pass up.
SMITH	Okay.
SAMANTHA	"Honey, you've put up a good fight but you have no idea who you're dealing with."
SAMANTHA	I'm going home with him and you're going home with Key lime custard.
SAMANTHA	So what do you say I buy your dinner and we call it a night.
CUSTOMER	"Oh, okay."
SAMANTHA	Check!
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, I was finally confident I could heat up my sex life because I was a sex columnist."
CARRIE	"I was resourceful, and I was drunk."
JACK	I'm sorry.
CARRIE	I got a little something for you.
CARRIE	And you're gonna love it.
CARRIE	Look at that.
CARRIE	"Get ready, mister 'cause I got something under here for you."
CARRIE	And there are shoes.
CARRIE	Wait till you see me in these.
JACK	Are you okay?
CARRIE	"Yeah, I'm fine."
CARRIE	And after a night of raw food Samantha enjoyed an all-nighter of raw sex.
SMITH	can I Tell You a secret?
SAMANTHA	You're 12?
SMITH	You didn't have to order all that shit.
SMITH	I was ready to go home with you last Tuesday.
SAMANTHA	"Now you tell me, I ate a fucking cactus."
SAMANTHA	get back down There and make It up to me.
SMITH	awesome.
CARRIE	Samantha was still having sex when it dawned on me that Berger and I hadn't.
JACK	Hey.
CARRIE	Hey.
CARRIE	"We both knew, it was now or never."
CARRIE	That morning I resigned myself to the idea that I would never again have frozen drinks or hot sex.
JACK	"I suck, this is awful."
CARRIE	I know.
JACK	I've never been this bad.
JACK	"Look, I don't want to toot my own horn here, but I'm way better than this."
JACK	I've been told I'm good at this.
JACK	I don't know what's happening.
CARRIE	We're so good everywhere else.
JACK	Would You look at us in restaurants?
CARRIE	We're the best.
JACK	We're the couple you want to be.
JACK	"All right, we gotta make the bed more like a restaurant."
CARRIE	Are you coming back?
JACK	Yeah.
JACK	Grab something that'll help.
JACK	Now we're talking.
JACK	"What do you have there, a pet?"
CARRIE	Shoes.
CARRIE	"Berger, what if we're just not good together in bed?"
JACK	"No, don't say that."
JACK	"All right, look, I choked."
JACK	we had It All going on.
CARRIE	we did.
JACK	"I thought it'd be great, and I wanted it to be great and I choked."
JACK	I came over the next night and thought it would be better and
CARRIE	I choked.
JACK	"What's up? We should be smoking, not choking."
JACK	I think sometimes the rhyme helps.
CARRIE	I agree.
JACK	"Boy, those are some very sexy shoes."
CARRIE	"Shall I put them on? Yeah, couldn't hurt."
JACK	"Here, throw some of that over your left shoulder."
JACK	"Come on, you want things to get worse?"
JACK	"I was gonna talk to You about It, But"
CARRIE	"I wanted to talk to You, But"
JACK	Let's make a deal.
JACK	"I talk to you, you talk to me."
CARRIE	We should be able to talk about these things.
JACK	Let's talk about it.
CARRIE	We'll talk.
CARRIE	"That morning the other shoe dropped, and it wasn't bad at all."
CARRIE	"In fact, it was kind of hot."
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
CARRIE	"In New York City, it is a statistical fact that once every seven minutes, an unsuspecting woman"
SMITH	Shut the fuck up!
CARRIE	dates an actor.
SAMANTHA	Let me go.
SAMANTHA	My husband will be home any minute!
CARRIE	"For Samantha, one of the perks of dating Jerry the actor was getting to stage full-scale fantasy productions."
SAMANTHA	Please don't hurt me.
SAMANTHA	I'll do anything.
SMITH	Just shut the fuck up!
SAMANTHA	You are really good.
SMITH	"I said, shut the fuck up."
SAMANTHA	"No, you shut the fuck up, and fuck me before my husband gets home."
SAMANTHA	Now!
SAMANTHA	"And then he pretended to tie my hands behind my back and the whole time he kept screaming, ""Shut the fuck up""."
SAMANTHA	"I tell you, it is so refreshing to be with someone who likes to fuck outside the box."
CARRIE	"and this is my friend, Samantha."
JACK	the wallflower.
JACK	Right.
CHARLOTTE	That is incredibly offensive.
CHARLOTTE	Violence against women is a very serious issue.
SAMANTHA	"Please, it was a fantasy."
SAMANTHA	Fantasies can't be censored.
IRANDA	"Actually, I think the Supreme Court is working on that right now."
SAMANTHA	All fantasies are healthy and harmless.
SAMANTHA	Don't you agree?
JACK	"You know, as a guy, I've always been under the impression that rape, or anything in the rape family is just not a good idea."
JACK	Can I go home now?
CARRIE	There is no greater sound than your friends laughing at your new boyfriend's jokes.
SAMANTHA	That's not the only scenario we play.
SAMANTHA	"Sometimes he's Senator Smith, or Principal Smith."
SAMANTHA	Cellmate Smith
CARRIE	"Okay, moving on."
CARRIE	"Miranda, how was your date with the real estate guy?"
IRANDA	"Actually, it wasn't horrible."
IRANDA	"He was kind of cute, and funny, and"
SAMANTHA	"Hello? Dr. Smith, thank you for returning my call."
SAMANTHA	"Excuse me, he thinks I may have the mumps."
SAMANTHA	"Yes, I'm swollen."
JACK	"Now, that's hot."
CHARLOTTE	So how did the date end?
IRANDA	He walked me home
IRANDA	"I'm sorry, are you maxed-out on girl talk?"
JACK	"No, I'm good."
JACK	I'll let you know.
IRANDA	"So he kissed me goodnight at the door, I invited him up."
IRANDA	He couldn't because he had an early meeting.
IRANDA	We kissed again.
IRANDA	Then he said he'd call.
CARRIE	Two kisses.
CARRIE	Very promising.
IRANDA	"You think, even though he didn't come up?"
CHARLOTTE	Definitely.
CHARLOTTE	"It means he likes you, but he wants to take it slow."
CHARLOTTE	That's nice.
IRANDA	"Berger, what do you think?"
JACK	You really want to know?
IRANDA	"Please, I would love to have a man's opinion for a change."
JACK	All right.
JACK	I'm not gonna sugarcoat it for you.
JACK	He's just not that into you.
CHARLOTTE	That's not true!
CARRIE	Don't listen to him.
IRANDA	"No, I'm intrigued."
IRANDA	Elaborate.
JACK	"Look, I'm sorry, but when a guy's really into you he's coming upstairs, meeting or no meeting."
CARRIE	That is ludicrous!
CARRIE	What about extenuating circumstances?
CARRIE	"What about you're stressed out, you're on deadline, you have a migraine?"
CHARLOTTE	Or a lot of guys are afraid of getting their feelings hurt and they don't want to ruin a friendship.
IRANDA	Or they're freaked out by their own feelings.
IRANDA	There's a lot of push-pull out there.
IRANDA	A lot of mixed messages.
JACK	"Yeah, I have to say that's all code for, ""He's just not that into you""."
JACK	"I'm sorry, but with guys it's very simple."
JACK	"If we're into you, we're coming upstairs."
JACK	We're booking the next date.
JACK	There are no mixed messages.
CHARLOTTE	No mixed messages? But
IRANDA	I've spent my whole life deciphering mixed messages.
CARRIE	I've made a whole career of it.
IRANDA	Wow.
IRANDA	He's just not that into me.
CARRIE	"Honey, ignore this person."
CARRIE	He doesn't know what he's talking about.
CARRIE	You're fired.
JACK	"Look, if he's not into you, the guy's obviously a weenie, so"
IRANDA	"No, I love it."
IRANDA	It is the most liberating thing I have ever heard.
IRANDA	Think how much time and therapy I could have saved over the last 20 years if I had known this.
CHARLOTTE	I still think the real estate guy is gonna call.
JACK	"I think you've got an uncomfortable e-mail coming your way, you know? Something like, ""Sorry I haven't called."
JACK	"""I'm in a place in the world where they don't have phones."""
IRANDA	[silently] I love him.
CARRIE	The best part of a night out with your friends is talking about them all the way home.
JACK	"Charlotte is a trip, Samantha's hilarious."
JACK	They all are.
CARRIE	they thought You were Hilarious.
JACK	how do You not love Miranda?
CARRIE	I know.
CARRIE	I love her.
CARRIE	And I love that you loved her.
CARRIE	"God, she loved you."
CARRIE	They all did.
CARRIE	And they're a tough crowd.
JACK	I'm a tough crowd.
CARRIE	
CARRIE	"We're perfect! When you went to the men's room, they were"
JACK	stop.
CARRIE	"What, am I talking Too much?"
JACK	"No, I wanna say something and I don't want you to say anything back, okay? You promise?"
JACK	I love you.
CARRIE	"I love you, too."
CARRIE	And I'm not saying it because you said it to me.
CARRIE	I promise.
CARRIE	I was gonna say it before.
CARRIE	I've been thinking it the whole night.
CARRIE	I love you.
CARRIE	I just wanted to say it again on my own.
CARRIE	In my euphoric state I knew there was only one kind of person who could tolerate me.
CHARLOTTE	"I'm in love, too! I'm so happy for you."
CARRIE	"It's the fastest I've ever said, ""I love you,"" but I could not hold it in my mouth."
CHARLOTTE	And why should you? There's no reason.
CHARLOTTE	You're in love.
CARRIE	I'm in love.
CHARLOTTE	"I love Harry So much, It hurts."
CARRIE	"Sometimes I look at Berger, and he's so cute I just wanna squeeze his face off!"
CHARLOTTE	This Friday night is my first official Shabbos.
CHARLOTTE	"So I am cooking a big, traditional dinner for Harry."
CHARLOTTE	I'm so excited to finally be a real Jew.
AN	"Here's your brisket, lady."
CHARLOTTE	"Listen, I said lean."
CARRIE	Just when I thought my week couldn't get any better I came home to find a little surprise from Berger.
CARRIE	From Berger's book to Samantha's books.
SMITH	"I'm sorry, Ms. Jones but you owe the U.S. Government $300,000 in back taxes."
SAMANTHA	"But, Auditor Smith, I don't have that kind of money."
SAMANTHA	"What are you going to do, take the shirt off my back? Take the shirt off my back."
SAMANTHA	Now this is what I call internal revenue.
CARRIE	"In my fantasy, Hurricane Pandora would be brilliant."
CARRIE	In reality it was.
JACK	"If you're still not finished, it's all over between us."
CARRIE	"I just finished it, just this minute."
CARRIE	I swear.
JACK	Did you stop for meals? It's been two days.
CARRIE	It's 400 pages.
JACK	"Well, I can't date a slow reader."
CARRIE	are You done?
JACK	"The question is, are you done?"
CARRIE	"Yes, I'm done, and if you would shut your trap I could tell you that I love, love, loved it."
CARRIE	I loved it! Except for one huge problem.
CARRIE	You have your leading lady running all over town wearing a scrunchy.
JACK	The hair thing? What's wrong with that?
CARRIE	"Nothing, unless you're writing about women in Manhattan."
CARRIE	"In which case, where do I begin?"
JACK	What are you talking about? Many New York women wear scrunchies.
CARRIE	"In the bathroom maybe, when they're washing their faces."
JACK	You're full of shit.
JACK	I've seen women every single day all over New York City wearing scrunchies.
CARRIE	But here's the thing.
CARRIE	Here's my crucial point.
CARRIE	"No woman who works at W magazine and lives on Perry Street would be caught dead at a hip, downtown restaurant wearing a scrunchy."
CARRIE	"Man, it's a good thing I came along because you may know the fellows, but I know the ladies."
JACK	Great.
CARRIE	"Okay, can I read you my favorite part?"
JACK	"No, I'm done talking about the book."
JACK	Are we ordering in?
CARRIE	He completely shut down.
CARRIE	Why? Why did I have to get up on my sassy horse and ruin everything?
IRANDA	"Yeah, sass will bite you on the ass."
CARRIE	And the thing that kills me is I love the book.
CARRIE	I could have gushed about it all night.
CARRIE	Why did I have to go straight to the negative and just pick at it?
IRANDA	Because you're in a relationship.
IRANDA	"I used to pick at Steve about everything: The way he held his fork, his grammar his dirty fingernails."
CARRIE	used to? he has a New girlfriend for That now.
IRANDA	Debbie.
CARRIE	do You think Debbie picks at Steve?
IRANDA	Of course.
IRANDA	All women pick.
IRANDA	It's in our DNA.
IRANDA	It's our little way of showing that we care.
CARRIE	I think I made it abundantly clear just how much I care.
IRANDA	You have to work it out with him.
IRANDA	Berger has single-handedly changed my life.
IRANDA	"I still haven't heard from the real estate guy, but it's fine."
IRANDA	He's just not that into me.
CARRIE	"I think, right now, Berger's just not that into me."
IRANDA	So talk to him about it.
IRANDA	You two seem like you could laugh your way through anything.
CARRIE	"Yeah, it's that kind of thinking that got me into this in the first place."
CARRIE	One of the signs that a female gorilla is in love is that she can be seen picking nits off her male companion.
CARRIE	"And yet, in humans, nit-picking can ruin a perfectly good evening not to mention a relationship."
CARRIE	Women are known to be more verbal than men.
CARRIE	But when does criticism that's constructive become destructive?
CARRIE	Are there times when the ladies should just shut the fuck up?
CARRIE	"The next morning, another woman was making too much noise."
RS. COLLIER	What on earth is all that banging?
CHARLOTTE	"Good morning, Mrs. Collier."
CHARLOTTE	I'm a Jew now.
CHARLOTTE	How are you?
PAM	I know he'll call eventually.
PAM	He's just going through a really hard time right now.
PAM	His boss got laid off.
CARRIE	"Later, on her lunch hour, Miranda checked her Blackberry."
CARRIE	There it was.
CARRIE	The uncomfortable e-mail Berger had predicted.
PAM	"Then, when they get busy, it's like, ""I can't call."
PAM	I'm so stressed.
PAM	""" But he's gonna call."
PAM	And his kitchen's being rewired.
ARCY	It's all so complicated.
PAM	That's a two-day process.
ARCY	at least.
IRANDA	"Excuse me, I couldn't help but overhear your conversation and I hope what I'm gonna say will save you a lot of time and energy."
IRANDA	He's just not that into you.
IRANDA	So move on.
IRANDA	Have a great day.
CARRIE	Having passed on the gospel to these New York women Miranda could only hope they would spread the word far and wide.
PAM	Bitch.
ARCY	who the hell asked her?
PAM	Not me.
ARCY	I know you didn't.
PAM	crazy people in New York.
ARCY	he is So gonna call you.
PAM	I know.
CARRIE	And as two women's fantasies were being shattered another's were being brought to life.
SMITH	"Detective Smith, Department of Homicide."
SMITH	"I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you some questions, ma'am."
SAMANTHA	"Why, certainly, Detective."
SAMANTHA	"Am I in some kind of trouble? Two martinis, please, straight up."
BARTENDER	"Yes, ma'am."
SMITH	"Actually, make Mine a seltzer."
SAMANTHA	"Of course, you're working."
SAMANTHA	"But, you know, Detective one little drink won't kill you."
SAMANTHA	He'll have a martini.
SMITH	"No, it's a seltzer."
SMITH	"Seriously, Samantha, I'm in AA."
CARRIE	That sobered Samantha right up.
SMITH	Totally fucked up for eight years in Seattle
SAMANTHA	"You know, I just realized."
SAMANTHA	I have a presentation first thing in the morning.
SAMANTHA	"So, sorry."
CARRIE	Jerry had taken the fantasy into dangerous territory.
CARRIE	Reality.
BARTENDER	two martinis.
SMITH	"No, dude, I said a seltzer."
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, Charlotte was hard at work on her fantasy role."
CARRIE	Martha Jewart.
CHARLOTTE	"The kugel's in the oven, the matzo balls are boiling."
CHARLOTTE	It's three hours till Shabbos.
CHARLOTTE	We should start braiding the challah.
CARRIE	"Doesn't Shabbos mean ""day of rest,"" i.e. ordering in?"
IRANDA	We're wearing aprons.
IRANDA	Do you own aprons?
CHARLOTTE	The challah!
CARRIE	"Okay, you don't have to holler."
CHARLOTTE	"Miranda, like this."
IRANDA	I don't know what I'm doing.
IRANDA	Why did you call me over here?
CARRIE	"Because I didn't want to spend the entire week saying, ""Guess you had to be there."""
CHARLOTTE	Did Harry's friend ever call you?
IRANDA	Yes.
IRANDA	"As a matter of fact, I'm seeing him tonight."
IRANDA	You think I can get away with this outfit?
CARRIE	"Definitely, the apron softens you."
CHARLOTTE	"Can you read me what's next, after it's braided?"
CARRIE	"With her high school boyfriend, Charlotte doodled."
CARRIE	"With Harry, she Jew-dled."
IRANDA	I think it calls for two cups of Mrs. Harry York-Goldenblatt.
IRANDA	Did I miss something? Did you get married while I was at work?
CHARLOTTE	"No, but that's where we're headed."
CARRIE	You forgot Charlotte Yorkenblatt.
CHARLOTTE	"Actually, I've been making some calls and I was wondering how you both felt about November."
IRANDA	November? For what?
CHARLOTTE	For our wedding.
CHARLOTTE	Most of the synagogues are booked through the fall.
CARRIE	November Works for me.
IRANDA	has Harry even proposed yet?
CHARLOTTE	"No, but he will."
IRANDA	Aren't you counting your matzo balls before they rise?
CARRIE	"Miranda, zip the lip."
CHARLOTTE	We have an understanding about our future.
CHARLOTTE	We don't have to talk about it all the time.
CHARLOTTE	It's b'shert.
IRANDA	I don't know what that means.
CHARLOTTE	It's meant to be.
CHARLOTTE	I would never have gone through all this trouble if I didn't know for sure that we were getting married.
IRANDA	"I'm sorry, I just don't want to see you get hurt again."
CARRIE	And ever since her reality check with Jerry Samantha had no interest in seeing him again.
CARRIE	"However, when a certain government official called she was more than happy to take a meeting."
SAMANTHA	"Secret Service Agent Smith, if you're here who's protecting the President?"
SMITH	"You know, I changed my mind."
SMITH	I thought of something even hotter for us to play.
SAMANTHA	Hotter than Secret Service sluts?
SMITH	"I'm me, you're you."
SMITH	Go.
SMITH	"You know, when I told you the other night I was in AA, you bolted."
SMITH	What's up with that?
SAMANTHA	"It is Jerry, isn't it?"
SAMANTHA	I'm afraid we want different things.
SAMANTHA	You want to tell me all about you and I don't want you to tell me all about you.
SAMANTHA	It spoils the fantasy.
SMITH	That's harsh.
SAMANTHA	"Yeah, I am harsh."
SAMANTHA	"I'm also demanding, stubborn, self-sufficient, and always right."
SAMANTHA	"In bed, at the office, and everywhere else."
SMITH	I already knew that.
SAMANTHA	And that's just a little bit about me.
SMITH	"All right, cool."
SMITH	Let me tell you one little thing about me.
SAMANTHA	"see, this is Exactly"
SMITH	at least let me Tell You my last name.
SMITH	It's Jerrod.
SAMANTHA	Your parents named you Jerry Jerrod?
SAMANTHA	No wonder You drank.
SMITH	Right.
CARRIE	There would still be accountants and undercover agents in their future.
CARRIE	"But that night, Samantha and Jerry got off on playing themselves."
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, I was looking forward to putting the scrunchy moment behind us."
CARRIE	"Unfortunately, it was staring us in the face."
JACK	"Okay, I'm sorry to have to do this but I do believe we are in the presence of a scrunchy."
JACK	"I also do believe, and correct me if I'm wrong that we are in New York City proper."
JACK	This woman does not appear to be washing her face.
JACK	"She appears to be standing in line at a hip, downtown restaurant."
JACK	So it kind of kills your New York woman theory.
JACK	"Tough break, Bradshaw."
CARRIE	She's not from New York.
JACK	What? Doesn't matter.
CARRIE	Doesn't matter.
CARRIE	Did they say how long the wait was gonna be?
JACK	Excuse me.
JACK	"Hi, I'm sorry to bother you."
JACK	We're just wondering what part of New York you live in.
RESTAURANT PATRON	"Me? I am from Macon, Georgia."
RESTAURANT PATRON	"But thanks, you made my whole day."
RESTAURANT PATRON	"Honey, did you hear that? These people think I live in New York."
RESTAURANT PATRON	I'm so hungry.
RESTAURANT PATRON	When are they gonna let us sit down?
CARRIE	"Downtown, over curried lamb and chutney Miranda found herself pleasantly surprised by Charlotte's matchmaking skills."
PAUL	That was one spicy biryani!
IRANDA	"I know, I've lost all feeling in my tongue."
IRANDA	"Listen, I know a great place around the corner if you wanna get coffee."
PAUL	"I wish I could, but I really should call it a night."
IRANDA	"It's fine, I understand."
IRANDA	"You're just not that into me, and it's okay."
IRANDA	I get it.
PAUL	"No, I like you."
PAUL	I just really have to go.
IRANDA	"Paul, come on, You can Stop lying."
PAUL	I am not lying.
IRANDA	"Come on, be a man."
IRANDA	Tell the truth.
PAUL	I have diarrhea.
CARRIE	Apparently there is one rare exception to Berger's rule and it often involves curry.
CARRIE	"After dinner, Berger ate banana cream pie and I ate my words."
CARRIE	Another thing I loved was the way you used the sister's phone calls as little landposts.
CARRIE	"I mean, landmarks or mileposts."
CARRIE	Anyway I just loved how those sort of punctuated the story.
CARRIE	It was just a really nice touch.
CARRIE	"Oh, my God, the introduction Brilliant! You're instantly on this guy's side, even though he's a complete mess."
CARRIE	"You know, you really just nailed him."
CARRIE	While I was working overtime Charlotte's work was finally coming to an end.
CHARLOTTE	"Harry, you can come on in now."
CHARLOTTE	Sorry it's so late.
HARRY 	What's all this?
CHARLOTTE	"Since it's our first Shabbos together, I wanted to make it a little special."
HARRY 	A little?
HARRY 	This is phenomenal.
CHARLOTTE	I just need to get the candles and then we can say the bracha.
CHARLOTTE	Come on.
CHARLOTTE	"Honey, please turn that off."
CHARLOTTE	We're about to eat.
HARRY 	It smells incredible.
HARRY 	And you made brisket.
HARRY 	I cannot believe you made brisket.
CHARLOTTE	good Shabbos.
HARRY 	"good Shabbos, sweetie."
HARRY 	I cannot believe you made all this.
HARRY 	What did I do to deserve you?
CHARLOTTE	I feel the same way.
CHARLOTTE	I've been thinking about blessings and you are such a blessing to me.
CHARLOTTE	What are you
CHARLOTTE	Why is the TV on?
HARRY 	It's on mute.
CHARLOTTE	Mute? We're having Shabbos dinner.
HARRY 	"It's a big game, honey."
CHARLOTTE	Turn it off.
CHARLOTTE	I want you to turn it off right this minute.
HARRY 	But it's
CHARLOTTE	off now.
HARRY 	Let me just watch this one pitch.
CHARLOTTE	I gave up Christ for you and you can't give up the Mets?
HARRY 	It's gonna be a long life if you keep that up.
HARRY 	"""I gave up Christ for you, take out the trash."
HARRY 	"""I gave up Christ for you, pick up your socks."""
CHARLOTTE	Do you have any idea how hard I worked to prepare this meal for you?
CHARLOTTE	I went to Zabar's every day this week I had to make 30 matzo balls just to get four that were the right size and shape.
CHARLOTTE	Not to mention the months of studying and cramming like a maniac to convert to Judaism.
CHARLOTTE	And what have you done for me? Set the date.
HARRY 	What are you talking about?
CHARLOTTE	You said you couldn't marry me unless I was Jewish and now I'm Jewish.
CHARLOTTE	Set the date!
HARRY 	You're acting crazy! Do you hear yourself?
CHARLOTTE	Do you know how lucky you are to have me? Do you know how we look? Do you know what people out there think when they see us together? Do you?
HARRY 	"Yeah, I know what people are thinking."
HARRY 	I just didn't think you were one of them.
CARRIE	Finally it was Charlotte who was on mute.
HARRY 	I don't need this.
HARRY 	I'm leaving.
HARRY 	To think I bought a ring.
CARRIE	"The Mets won that night, 5 to 4."
CARRIE	But Charlotte lost everything that mattered to her.
CARRIE	I just remembered another hilarious part.
CARRIE	"And later, on the corner of 73rd and mea culpa"
CARRIE	You know the scene where the dishwasher guy is spooning up the Rice Chex and he's putting them back in the box?
CARRIE	It's perfection.
CARRIE	How did you come up with that?
JACK	It's so lame.
CARRIE	"No, It was not."
CARRIE	It was hysterical.
JACK	I'm not talking about the book.
JACK	I'm talking about what you're doing right now.
CARRIE	I just wanted you to know how much I loved your book because I did.
CARRIE	And I'm sorry I muddied it up with the whole scrunchy thing.
JACK	It's not that big a deal.
JACK	I think I'm gonna call it a night.
JACK	I gotta get an early start tomorrow.
CARRIE	are You kidding?
JACK	no.
JACK	Thanks for dinner.
JACK	I'll call you tomorrow.
CARRIE	And then there are times when a New York woman should not shut the fuck up.
CARRIE	Hey. Berger. Berger. You can't just pull that line on me and walk away.
JACK	This time it's true.
CARRIE	"You're obviously still pissed, and I'm sorry but you can't just shut down like this."
CARRIE	We have to be able to say what's on our minds.
CARRIE	If you thought that I had made some kind of mistake I would want you to tell me.
JACK	Nice hat. Carrie
CARRIE	"It's fabulous, and you said that to hurt my feelings."
JACK	That's how you made me feel that night.
CARRIE	Fabulous.
JACK	"So, You Could Just walk away now?"
CARRIE	"Yes, I can."
JACK	"I'm sorry, all right?"
JACK	What was I supposed to do with that scrunchy comment?
JACK	Was I supposed to hop in my time machine and fix my entire book?
CARRIE	"I don't know what your problem is, but it has nothing to do with a scrunchy."
JACK	"Yeah, it's about the fact that my book is a big, fat, fucking failure."
CARRIE	Wait.
CARRIE	What?
JACK	"It's just, I already feel like shit."
JACK	"You trying to pump me up all night, not helping."
JACK	I'm sure this is all very sexy.
JACK	You probably never really
CARRIE	Stop.
CARRIE	I want to say something and I want you to listen.
CARRIE	You're a beautiful writer and I loved your book.
CARRIE	And I love you.
CARRIE	And I still think you're very sexy.
CARRIE	And I'm not gonna let you make a joke right now.
JACK	Then I got nothing.
CARRIE	Come on.
CARRIE	"Saying ""I love you"" is easy."
CARRIE	What comes next is a little scrunchier.
CARRIE	Harry hadn't called in two days except to say he was sending someone over to pick up his TV.
CARRIE	Just what New York needs.
CARRIE	Another single Jewish girl.
CARRIE	Good morning.
JACK	Good morning.
JACK	mind if I get in There and wash my face?
CARRIE	not at all.
CARRIE	"Oh, my God, where did you get that?"
JACK	"Macon, Georgia."
JACK	"Why, you wanna try it on?"
JACK	You're gonna look so pretty with this scrunchy on.
CARRIE	"No, I hate you!"
CARRIE	"In every relationship, there comes a time when you take that next important step."
JACK	do I look All right?
CARRIE	"Don't worry, they'll love you."
JACK	I Just want to make the Right impression.
CARRIE	They'll love you because I love you.
CARRIE	Here we are.
CARRIE	"For some couples, that step is meeting the parents."
CARRIE	"For me, it's meeting the Prada."
JACK	Holy shit.
JACK	"You know, on my planet, the clothing stores have clothes."
JACK	Ladies.
JACK	So how often do you shop here?
TONY	Carrie.
CARRIE	Hi.
JACK	I'm gonna guess more than once.
TONY	"If all my customers were this beautiful, yes?"
CARRIE	"this is my Boyfriend, Jack."
JACK	how are you?
JACK	"Okay, two."
JACK	Bonus round.
JACK	I'm down with that.
TONY	"He's funny, yes?"
CARRIE	Yes.
CARRIE	And this is his first time at Prada.
TONY	we have some amazing New things for men.
JACK	I'm here for my amazing new girlfriend.
PRADA CLERK	"Can I get you something to drink? Cappuccino, bottled water, champagne?"
JACK	Champagne?
TONY	Yes.
CARRIE	Some couples spend Saturday afternoon shopping.
TONY	"Look, everybody, it's Carrie."
CARRIE	Other couples spend it sexing.
SAMANTHA	Aren't you gonna shower?
JERRY	Nope.
JERRY 	I want to smell you on me all night.
SAMANTHA	Dirty boy.
SAMANTHA	So how's Friday at 9:00?
JERRY	I can't do Friday.
SAMANTHA	"But we always do Friday, it's T.G.I.Fuckday."
JERRY	my play starts previews this week.
SAMANTHA	play?
JERRY	I was thinking you could come check it out. It's a kick-ass play.
SAMANTHA	"""Kick-ass play."""
SAMANTHA	Three words I hope never to hear again.
JERRY	come on.
JERRY	It's in Brooklyn.
SAMANTHA	I don't do borough.
SAMANTHA	Don't give me that look.
SAMANTHA	I'm the one who should be hurt.
SAMANTHA	You always spend Fridays in me.
JERRY	"Okay, here's the deal."
JERRY	"You come see me in Brooklyn and afterwards, I'll make sure you come and come and come in the bedroom."
CARRIE	What do You think?
JACK	two things.
JACK	"One, you look damn fine."
JACK	"Two, I'm a little hammered."
TONY	"Here, for you."
TONY	Try.
CARRIE	"Now, that is fabulous."
JACK	"You know, I never say fabulous, but if I did, I would."
JACK	That's what a real shirt looks like.
TONY	But You will wear Forever.
JACK	"Yeah, I'd have to."
JACK	Does it also somehow open into a small studio apartment?
TONY	"Carrie, tell him."
TONY	"My girlfriend used to talk me into things, and I'm a better man for it."
JACK	This is our first shopping trip together.
JACK	I want to take it slow.
CARRIE	So how is Claudia?
TONY	We broke up.
TONY	"Yes, is tragic."
TONY	Only thing more tragic is Jack not having Prada.
JACK	"What can I say, except thanks for the hooch."
TONY	"Carrie, do you know any fantastic gorgeous single women like yourself I could go out with?"
CARRIE	"Cheer up, sweetie."
CARRIE	I may have found you the impossible dreamboat.
CARRIE	"Straight, single, and works for Prada."
CHARLOTTE	is he Jewish?
CHARLOTTE	what? did You think I Would throw away All my New religious beliefs Just because Harry and I are No longer together?
IRANDA	Yeah.
CHARLOTTE	I am not a fair-weather Jew.
CHARLOTTE	"Besides, I can't even think about dating again."
CHARLOTTE	I'm way too sad about losing Harry.
SAMANTHA	"Now, Charlotte, honey."
SAMANTHA	You will start dating eventually and by then this Prada item may be off the rack.
IRANDA	"If she's not ready to move on, she's not ready to move on."
IRANDA	People can't move on before they're ready.
IRANDA	I'm just saying.
CHARLOTTE	I can't even imagine dating again.
CHARLOTTE	"I mean, what would I say about myself? ""I was married and then I got divorced ""then I fell in love with my divorce lawyer and we were gonna get married ""but then I blew it and we split up, too."""
CHARLOTTE	It's depressing.
CARRIE	Now you went and told the truth.
CARRIE	What are we gonna do about it? I say we get all dressed up and go out for drinks Friday night.
CARRIE	I'll wear my new Prada.
SAMANTHA	I'm in.
IRANDA	Excellent.
SAMANTHA	"Shit, motherfucker fuck shit."
IRANDA	"There's a ""Shit, motherfucker fuck shit"" situation?"
SAMANTHA	I have to Go to the theatre.
CARRIE	they finally made That mandatory?
SAMANTHA	A new play in Brooklyn.
SAMANTHA	Jerry's in it.
IRANDA	So it's children's theatre?
CHARLOTTE	I think that's sweet.
SAMANTHA	"It's not sweet, it's pathetic how far a gal will go for a good fuck."
CARRIE	"And speaking of the theatre, that night Miranda continued performing her one-woman show I'm Not In Love With Steve."
IRANDA	How was life on the playground?
STEVE	The little bratty girl had a birthday.
IRANDA	Bratty had a birthday?
STEVE	"Yep, here."
STEVE	I scammed you a cupcake.
STEVE	It's chocolate.
STEVE	I had to fight for it.
IRANDA	For me? Thanks.
STEVE	I'm getting a gut from all the cupcake action on that playground.
IRANDA	You don't have a gut.
STEVE	"Okay, so I gotta run."
STEVE	I wanna get home to see the Knicks game.
IRANDA	Why don't you watch it here?
IRANDA	"I pay for ESPN and all, and I've got all this extra food and all."
IRANDA	"Unless you have plans with someone, in which case"
STEVE	Debbie's got shit to do.
STEVE	I wouldn't be crowding you?
IRANDA	For the guy who scammed me the chocolate cupcake.
STEVE	Cool.
CARRIE	The Knicks overtime turned into Steve's overnighter.
JACK	"All right, now I have to call somebody."
JACK	You have a Prada abuse problem.
CARRIE	"I do, do I? Here."
CARRIE	For you.
CARRIE	"It's the ""I never say fabulous"" fabulous shirt."
JACK	"Carrie, thanks, but you can't afford this."
JACK	You can't afford that stuff you bought yourself.
CARRIE	"Last week I couldn't, but voilÃ ."
CARRIE	It's a check from our publishers.
CARRIE	They sold my book in Paris.
CARRIE	It's an advance from France.
JACK	That's quite an advance.
CARRIE	"I know, I can't believe it."
CARRIE	"Half off at home, big deal in France."
CARRIE	I'm the literary Jerry Lewis.
CARRIE	"So, you see, you have to have the ""I never say fabulous"" fabulous shirt because you are the most fabulous of all the fabulous men who never say ""fabulous."""
JACK	"Okay, thank you."
CARRIE	I'm starving.
CARRIE	What looks good?
CARRIE	The next day I met Miranda and little lord Brady for an early evening walk.
CARRIE	"If I get tired in about a block, can you push me around in that?"
IRANDA	Sure.
IRANDA	Steve slept over the other night.
IRANDA	On the couch.
IRANDA	We were watching the Knicks game and it got late.
CARRIE	Someone's gonna get hurt.
IRANDA	"Carrie, I can't help it."
IRANDA	It was the most fun I've had in a long time.
IRANDA	I like Being around him.
CARRIE	"then Tell Him That, I beg Of you."
IRANDA	"he has a girlfriend, did You forget?"
CARRIE	"No, did you?"
IRANDA	no.
CARRIE	he probably already knows how You feel.
IRANDA	"No way, I'm acting my ass off."
CARRIE	"There is no Academy Award for that, just so you know."
CARRIE	"My God, Courtney."
CARRIE	Hi.
COURTNEY	"Carrie Bradshaw, the toast Of Europe."
CARRIE	Hardly.
CARRIE	"Miranda, this is Courtney, my publisher."
COURTNEY	Ex-publisher.
COURTNEY	I just got the boot.
COURTNEY	Hence the gin.
COURTNEY	I'm gonna go home and make myself a welfare martini.
CARRIE	Wait.
CARRIE	Why?
COURTNEY	"Quote, Disappointing sales in my sector. End quote."
CARRIE	I'm sorry.
COURTNEY	Fuck them. end quote
COURTNEY	If it weren't for the European interest in your book I'd have gotten the boot a week ago when they started dropping all my authors.
COURTNEY	How's Berger handling it? He's so frigging talented.
COURTNEY	I can't stand it.
COURTNEY	They should've never dropped his second book option.
COURTNEY	Shortsighted A-holes.
COURTNEY	You tell him to get the phone book out and give me a call if he needs a drinking buddy.
COURTNEY	Cute kid.
COURTNEY	See you.
CARRIE	Berger never said anything to me.
CARRIE	My God.
CARRIE	And I'm running around buying him shirts and shoving my big check in his face.
IRANDA	You didn't know.
CARRIE	"God, I feel awful."
CARRIE	Why did I have to parade in and brag about that check?
IRANDA	Because you're proud of it.
IRANDA	And you earned it.
IRANDA	It's okay to be proud of it.
CARRIE	this is not Good.
CARRIE	So what now? Should I tell him I know?
IRANDA	Maybe you should wait till he brings it up.
CARRIE	"Move over, Brady, I'm getting tired."
CARRIE	And in Central Park
ANTHONY	Not him.
ANTHONY	Gay.
ANTHONY	Gay and doesn't know it.
ANTHONY	Here.
ANTHONY	"Pale with no arms, straight, and Jewish."
CHARLOTTE	"Please, Harry and I just broke up."
ANTHONY	"Char, you loved Harry, I loved Harry."
ANTHONY	We all loved Harry.
ANTHONY	But it's been two weeks.
ANTHONY	Next.
CHARLOTTE	No next.
CHARLOTTE	It doesn't work like that.
ANTHONY	"It do, and it better, because you are knock, knock, knocking on sad-gal door."
ANTHONY	And nobody loves a sad gal.
CHARLOTTE	You don't understand what this feels like.
CHARLOTTE	You've never Never mind.
ANTHONY	What? I've never what? Lost the love of my life? Wrong.
ANTHONY	Paolo.
ANTHONY	Brazilian.
ANTHONY	Broke my heart.
ANTHONY	I've never gotten over him.
CHARLOTTE	Anthony.
ANTHONY	Had an ass like two scoops of butter pecan ice cream.
ANTHONY	Him.
ANTHONY	I could see you with him.
CHARLOTTE	I'm not interested.
ANTHONY	You better get interested or you're gonna end up all alone and with no mans.
CHARLOTTE	Maybe I am.
ANTHONY	Would that be the worst thing that could happen?
ANTHONY	Nice day to get laid.
ACTOR	The corn.
ACTRESS	Harvested.
ACTOR	The hay.
ACTRESS	Harvested.
ACTOR	My youth?
ACTRESS	My youth
CARRIE	Samantha wondered if perhaps she'd judged the arts too quickly.
SMITH	So was it worth the trip?
SAMANTHA	"I'm not usually a fan of the theater, but get your cock out."
SMITH	did You like the play?
SAMANTHA	I felt like I was hit with a tranquilizer dart.
SMITH	did You at least like my monologue?
SAMANTHA	"What monologue? after You dropped trou, All I Could think was I got to get me some Of that."
SAMANTHA	This.
SMITH	I hope the critics like it more than you.
SMITH	I quit my restaurant job today.
SMITH	They wouldn't let me off to do the play.
SMITH	So Fuck them.
SMITH	Maybe it'll be a big hit.
SAMANTHA	How? the promotion Of this thing is All out Of whack.
SAMANTHA	"You have this pathetic, sad little flyer and nowhere on it does it say the most important thing about the play."
SMITH	What's that?
SAMANTHA	"full frontal, You, naked."
SAMANTHA	"Now, that's a reason to go to the theater."
SAMANTHA	Who's doing the P.R.?
SMITH	No one.
SMITH	They don't have money for that kind of thing.
SMITH	"We're getting paid, like, $30."
SAMANTHA	Is this really what you want to do with your life? Stand in an empty theater talking some harvest-to-harvest bullshit?
SMITH	Yeah.
SMITH	I love it.
SMITH	I'm an actor.
SAMANTHA	Then I'm gonna help you.
SMITH	You're gonna help me be an actor?
SAMANTHA	"No, I'm gonna help you be a star."
SAMANTHA	"Look, if I have to go see you act, there better be a red carpet involved."
SMITH	I don't need help.
SMITH	All I gotta do is work on my craft.
SAMANTHA	All you have to do is work on your abs.
SAMANTHA	But we have to do something about your name.
SAMANTHA	Jerry Jerrod.
SAMANTHA	Awful.
SMITH	Stop talking.
SAMANTHA	Whatever You say.
SAMANTHA	Matt? Toby? Ryan.
CARRIE	Is something wrong?
JACK	"No, I'm just preoccupied."
CARRIE	"Berger, it's okay."
CARRIE	I know.
CARRIE	About the book option.
CARRIE	I bumped into Courtney a few days ago.
JACK	Why didn't you say anything sooner?
CARRIE	Because I didn't know if
JACK	Does Anyone else know?
CARRIE	like Who?
JACK	Any of your friends?
CARRIE	"Miranda was with me, but she"
JACK	I don't want her to know.
CARRIE	"She's fine, it's no big deal."
JACK	It is to me.
CARRIE	"No, I meant to her."
JACK	Right.
CARRIE	I'm sorry.
JACK	What do you have to be sorry about?
CARRIE	The shirt and the check.
CARRIE	I feel awful.
CARRIE	I would never
JACK	This has nothing to do with that.
JACK	I think that check is great.
JACK	Don't feel bad about that.
JACK	You earned that.
JACK	Good for you.
JACK	I'm proud of you.
CARRIE	"Berger, do you want me to talk to my new editor?"
JACK	Jesus Christ.
JACK	"No, thank you."
JACK	It's just a dropped option.
JACK	I'll be fine.
CARRIE	"Yes, you will be."
CARRIE	Because you're great.
CARRIE	He grunted.
CARRIE	End of discussion.
CARRIE	I shouldn't have said anything.
SAMANTHA	"look, when men are failing"
CARRIE	Berger is not failing.
SAMANTHA	"Fine, when men are flailing"
CARRIE	"Okay, yes, there's a bit of a flail."
SAMANTHA	they need strong women to charge in there and help.
SAMANTHA	Like I did with Smith.
CARRIE	Who?
SAMANTHA	Jerry.
SAMANTHA	I changed his name.
SAMANTHA	I'm helping him with his career and Smith is the perfect name for the next big thing.
SAMANTHA	"""Smith, the next it boy, is so it ""that the glitterati are migrating to Brooklyn to see him act."""
CARRIE	Are the glitterati migrating to Brooklyn?
SAMANTHA	"Yes, you are."
SAMANTHA	I got tickets for us all opening night.
SAMANTHA	"Invite everyone fabulous you know, and dress up."
SAMANTHA	I've got a whole red-carpet thing happening.
CARRIE	Why are you doing all this?
SAMANTHA	He's 28 and making $30 a week.
SAMANTHA	The poor guy was dying.
SAMANTHA	"I could help, so I did."
CARRIE	And he isn't threatened by you offering to help?
SAMANTHA	"No, he's a whole different generation."
SAMANTHA	Younger guys aren't threatened by strong women having power.
CARRIE	Is it a whole generation or just him?
CARRIE	"As women's roles evolve and change, we assume that men's do as well."
CARRIE	There are hundreds upon hundreds of articles written about the new man.
CARRIE	But does this new man really exist?
CARRIE	Perhaps he's just the old man renamed and repackaged by some clever P.R. Woman.
CARRIE	Are the men of today less threatened by a woman's power or are they just acting?
STEVE	Hang on.
STEVE	You're early.
IRANDA	am I?
STEVE	Yeah.
STEVE	You look nice.
IRANDA	Do I? Looks like it's someone else's turn to make cupcakes.
IRANDA	That is so cute.
STEVE	"I never did it before, but it can't be that hard, right?"
IRANDA	do I look like the baking type?
STEVE	Right.
IRANDA	"""Mix batter in a large bowl."""
IRANDA	"Okay, here's a bowl."
IRANDA	"Look at me, I'm baking."
STEVE	"Miranda, you don't have to do that."
IRANDA	"Someone needs to help you, and Brady really has no motor skills."
IRANDA	One condition: I get to lick the bowl.
STEVE	Deal.
STEVE	I have the milk and eggs right here.
IRANDA	You really are gonna score points on the playground this week.
STEVE	It's not for the playground.
STEVE	They're birthday cupcakes for Debbie.
IRANDA	Fun.
STEVE	"We're having a party, and she said she didn't want a cake but she didn't say anything about cupcakes."
IRANDA	So how many cupcakes are we making?
STEVE	H-A-P-P-Y-B-l-R-T-H-D-A-Y-D-E-B-B-l-E.
STEVE	-20
IRANDA	20. Great.
STEVE	"That's bad, right?"
IRANDA	"here, let me do it."
STEVE	Shit.
STEVE	It's 6:30.
STEVE	I gotta go to work.
STEVE	"Okay, let's just I'll finish those later."
IRANDA	Just go.
IRANDA	I'll do it.
IRANDA	You can't do letters anyway.
STEVE	"really, You sure?"
IRANDA	go.
STEVE	Thanks.
STEVE	"Miranda, you're the best."
CARRIE	Jello.
IRANDA	"I'm not going, I'm not up for it."
CARRIE	"If I'm going to the theater, you're going to the theater."
IRANDA	I can't.
CARRIE	Are you all right? What's wrong?
IRANDA	"I'm at Steve's, and he had to go to work and I got stuck helping him make 20 cupcakes for his girlfriend's birthday."
CARRIE	Why Would he Ask You do that?
IRANDA	He didn't.
IRANDA	"I thought they were for the playground, and then it was too late to back out."
IRANDA	It's my own fault.
IRANDA	"What did I think would happen? He would see how great I make cupcakes and be back in love with me? Damn it! I fucked up Debbie's ""B."""
CARRIE	put down the icing.
IRANDA	I have to finish.
CARRIE	Debbie cannot have your tears.
CARRIE	No way.
IRANDA	"If I don't finish, Steve will know something's up."
CARRIE	"Miranda, you can't make those cupcakes and live with yourself."
CARRIE	Move away from the icing.
IRANDA	What'll I tell Steve?
CARRIE	blame the baby.
CARRIE	That's what they're there for.
IRANDA	I put It down.
CARRIE	good girl.
CARRIE	"God, that's Berger in a cab."
CARRIE	I'm not dressed yet.
CARRIE	Listen to me.
CARRIE	"You get out of there, you go home, and I'll call you later, okay?"
CARRIE	Okay.
CARRIE	I love you.
CARRIE	Bye-bye.
IRANDA	me too.
IRANDA	Bye.
JACK	Surprise.
CARRIE	That's not a cab.
JACK	"No, this'll be much more fun."
JACK	I haven't had her out on the open road for a long time.
CARRIE	I'm not really dressed very biker chick.
CARRIE	Prada and all.
JACK	"It'll be fine, come on."
CARRIE	Not to be a total girl about it but I really can't have the helmet hair when there's a red carpet situation.
JACK	We haven't been out on this thing the whole time we've been dating.
JACK	I really want to take the bike tonight.
JACK	Think about how much fun it's gonna be going over the Brooklyn Bridge.
JACK	"Come on, Carrie."
JACK	For me?
CARRIE	"All right, just don't go fast."
JACK	"Good hat, huh?"
CARRIE	There is a little-known relationship law.
CARRIE	"When your man is down and out, you have to get up and on."
CARRIE	I told you not to go fast.
JACK	It wasn't that fast.
JACK	It just feels fast because you're on the bike.
CARRIE	Bullshit.
CARRIE	Couldn't you feel my hands digging into you?
JACK	"Yeah, I thought You were excited."
CARRIE	I was terrified.
JACK	"All right, calm down, you're safe."
CARRIE	I am not gonna die on a bridge so that you can feel like some big man on a bike.
JACK	What the Fuck Does That mean?
CARRIE	You know Exactly What It means.
CARRIE	"And I am sorry, but I'm not sorry I made that money."
CARRIE	"I worked really hard for it, and I never thought you would be the type of guy that would have a problem with that."
JACK	Neither did I.
JACK	"But I guess I do, don't I?"
JACK	I'm sorry about the bike.
CARRIE	Are you gonna look at me?
JACK	I didn't think I was going that fast.
JACK	"I'm sorry, I'll never do it again."
CARRIE	"Well, I'll never get on that bike again."
JACK	"Look, I don't want to be this guy."
JACK	I don't want to be the guy threatened by your success.
JACK	"I swear to God, I will do anything, I'll do whatever it takes."
JACK	I don't want to be this guy.
JACK	I think you are magnificent.
JACK	I do.
CARRIE	That was for the helmet.
CARRIE	"Come on, let's get this over with."
PHOTOGRAPHERS	"Carrie, over here."
PHOTOGRAPHERS	"Right here, Carrie."
JACK	They know you?
CARRIE	I used to be a party girl.
PHOTOGRAPHERS	Can we get one alone?
JACK	"Yeah, Sure."
CARRIE	"No, we're together."
PHOTOGRAPHERS	What's his name?
CARRIE	Jack.
CARRIE	"He's a writer, too."
PHOTOGRAPHERS	"Lovely, thanks a lot."
PHOTOGRAPHERS	Cheers.
CARRIE	They just do that so that they can get it right for the papers.
JACK	This just isn't my night.
JACK	"Look, I'm really not up to going in."
JACK	I'll just wreck it for everybody.
JACK	"Would it be okay if I took off? You can get home with the girls, right? You okay?"
STANFORD	"""Hello, gorgeous."""
CARRIE	That is the worst Barbra Streisand I have ever heard.
STANFORD	"When in Brooklyn, do as the Brooklyns do."
STANFORD	"Speaking of the worst, I have, like, the worst seat I've ever had."
CARRIE	Not anymore you don't.
CARRIE	You're sitting with me.
CARRIE	"And speaking of ""one alone"" Charlotte sat in the theater surrounded by couples and in one, clear, crystallized moment she felt what her life would be like with no mans."
CARRIE	Miranda's not coming.
CARRIE	So my friend Tony from Prada is sitting next to you.
CHARLOTTE	Hello.
CARRIE	"After all, what single girl in New York would turn down a gift from Prada?"
SAMANTHA	All of Manhattan is here.
STANFORD	Who's watching the Island?
ACTOR	My youth?
ACTRESS	My youth?
SMITH	The rain came down.
SMITH	"Hard, then soft."
SMITH	It hit the grass.
SMITH	"Green, then wet."
SMITH	"Wet, so wet."
SMITH	It reminded me of you.
SMITH	You always smelled like the rain.
STANFORD	A stud is born.
CARRIE	That night Smith's Full Moon became a sensation.
STANFORD	"full frontal, and he can act."
SAMANTHA	who knew?
SAMANTHA	Where's Berger?
CARRIE	he left.
CARRIE	He's coming down with a cold.
SAMANTHA	I'll see you later.
CARRIE	Okay.
CARRIE	Good night.
CHARLOTTE	You want to come out with me?
TONY	Sure.
CARRIE	"Maybe we were all acting, all the time."
CARRIE	And tonight I was playing the part of the woman in the great relationship whose boyfriend was coming down with a cold.
CARRIE	"In New York city where no good event gets going before 9 pm,"
CARRIE	it's a very bad sign when you get invited to something that starts at 9... am.
JACK	What are you going to say?
CARRIE	"I'm just going to tell them that before 10 am,"
CARRIE	"as far as I'm concerned, everybody's guilty."
CARRIE	I figure I'll be out in no time.
JACK	"Well, as long as I'm down here,"
JACK	I'm going to head over to J&R to look at some computer shit.
JACK	"When you get off, call me. We'll meet up do something."
CARRIE	"Well, aren't you going to write today?"
JACK	What does that mean?
CARRIE	It doesn't mean anything. It was just a question.
JACK	What did you think I was going to do?
JACK	Sit on my ass all day? Slack off?
CARRIE	"No, I didn't mean it like that."
CARRIE	"Look, it's early."
JACK	"Right, it's early."
CARRIE	And it's also a very bad sign
CARRIE	when a couple is fighting before 9 am.
JACK	You know what we need right now? A Hollywood kiss.
CARRIE	Here? We have coffee.
JACK	Come on. Hollywood kiss.
JACK	Better?
CARRIE	Better.
JACK	I'll see you later. I love you.
CARRIE	Ok. I love you too. Wish me luck.
JACK	Hang 'em high.
CARRIE	Hi. I hope you can help me with this.
CARRIE	I feel terrible but I don't think that I can serve jury duty today.
CARRIE	"You see, I work for myself as a freelance writer,"
CARRIE	and no one can cover for me.
WOMAN	Welcome to jury duty.
CARRIE	Meanwhile another woman was having trouble juggling her duties
IRANDA	"Oh, is it 8:30 already?"
AGDA	Good morning.
IRANDA	Fuck!
AGDA	"Don't say ""F""."
IRANDA	"I'm, uh, I'm going to be a little late tonight, work stuff."
IRANDA	"It's Ok, Brady."
IRANDA	Mommy's just got to go to work.
AGDA	Boy's fine.
AGDA	He just misses Mom.
AGDA	"Oh, look at that. Yes. Say bye-bye."
AGDA	"Bye bye, Mommy."
AGDA	"No no, it's not big deal"
IRANDA	"Bye bye, Brady."
CARRIE	"Along with her coffee, feeling guilty have become a part of Miranda's daily routine."
LENORE	"Let me help you, darling."
CHARLOTTE	Thanks Lenore.
LENORE	You have done such a wonderful job with this event.
LENORE	"Macaroom's on the outside, dear."
CHARLOTTE	I just hope people will enjoy it.
LENORE	I'm sure they will.
CARRIE	Charlotte had been guilted into joining the synagogue sisterhood society.
LENORE	"Now I know since Harry puh, puh, puh..."
LENORE	You've been coming to temple alone
LENORE	The break-up was bad news for you
LENORE	but good news for me.
LENORE	Hence... good news for you!
BARBARA	"Lenore, what are you saying over there?"
LENORE	I have someone for you.
LENORE	"Now I know, I don't look old enough to have a son your age but"
LENORE	I do!
BARBARA	"Charlotte, darling."
BARBARA	I have two single sons both perfect for you.
ELAINE	"Ah-ha, Barbara, I told you I wanted to fix her up with my David."
CARRIE	Charlotte may have been there to arrange the cookies
CARRIE	"but Barbara, Elaine and Lenore were there to arrange her next marriage."
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, Samantha had used her pushiness to parlay her new man's hit off-broadway show"
CARRIE	into a hot on-broadway poster.
SMITH	Fuck me!
SAMANTHA	"Well, that's the first thing every woman in town will be saying after she sees it."
SMITH	It's huge!
SAMANTHA	And that's the second.
SAMANTHA	"And honey, I'm not even sure the poster does you justice."
SMITH	Come on! My dick's like 3 stories long.
SAMANTHA	The way God had Madison avenue intended!
ACTRESS IN JURY PREPARATION VIDEO	"Sometimes when you're sitting on a jury,"
ACTRESS IN JURY PREPARATION VIDEO	it may seem as if all you're doing is a lot of waiting around.
ACTRESS IN JURY PREPARATION VIDEO	"but to the contrary, the catalyst for the resolution of the lawsuit is"
ACTRESS IN JURY PREPARATION VIDEO	the fact that you're there ready to hear the evidence and
ACTRESS IN JURY PREPARATION VIDEO	render a verdict.
ACTRESS IN JURY PREPARATION VIDEO	You're not just sitting around but
ACTRESS IN JURY PREPARATION VIDEO	rather playing an indispensible role in our justice system.
ACTRESS IN JURY PREPARATION VIDEO	But now let's take a look at the flow of a typical trial.
ACTRESS IN JURY PREPARATION VIDEO	"Whether you're serving on a civil or criminal trial,"
ACTRESS IN JURY PREPARATION VIDEO	there's a general procedure that is followed.
ACTRESS IN JURY PREPARATION VIDEO	"You may hear opening statements by the opposing attorneys,"
ACTRESS IN JURY PREPARATION VIDEO	each presenting their sides of the dispute.
ACTRESS IN JURY PREPARATION VIDEO	This is not evidence
CARRIE	It's just so weird!
CARRIE	"I mean, a mango wasn't even a fruit you can buy into."
CARRIE	I do believe it is the oddest thing you can pull out of a briefcase.
JACK	Except for pineapples.
JACK	"The moment he pulls out a pineapple,I want you to call me."
CARRIE	"Charlotte, what are you doing?"
CARRIE	Why are we hiding?
CHARLOTTE	I'm on the worst date of my life!
CARRIE	"Honey, I'm so sorry."
CHARLOTTE	This woman from the temple set me up with her son
CHARLOTTE	and he's awful! You have to help me.
CARRIE	Ok.
CHARLOTTE	Call me on your cell phone and tell me something bad happened.
CHARLOTTE	Then I'll rush out.
CARRIE	"Ok, then when the guy leaves I'll call you,"
CARRIE	you'll come back in and eat with us.
CHARLOTTE	Yes!
CARRIE	We've been dating a long time. We have contingency plans.
AVERAGE DATE	I asked for more bread but they haven't brought it yet.
CHARLOTTE	"Oh, I'm sorry. I wouldn't normally get that but maybe something bad happened."
CARRIE	"Hey, Charlotte, it's me. Something bad happened."
CHARLOTTE	Something bad happened?!
CHARLOTTE	I know it was going to be terrible.
CHARLOTTE	The man brought me carnations.
CARRIE	I see.
JACK	"Wait, hold up! The man brought you flowers?!What~ an asshole!"
CHARLOTTE	"Not flowers, carnations!"
JACK	What's so wrong with carnations?
CHARLOTTE	"Uck, they're filler flowers."
JACK	Would you dump a guy if I brought you carnations?
CARRIE	"Me? No, but I happened to like carnations, especially the pink ones."
CARRIE	"In fact, I think they're making a comeback."
CARRIE	"I would, however, throw away a guy for wearing dark siders or top-siders or any of the above."
CHARLOTTE	"No, those are cute!"
JACK	"So, basically guys are just fucked."
CHARLOTTE	"No, that's not true."
CHARLOTTE	None of that matters with the right guy.
CHARLOTTE	Harry was bald and he talked with his mouth full.
CHARLOTTE	but I loved him anyway.
JACK	Right. Because he didn't bring you filler flowers.
CHARLOTTE	No... becaue I loved him.
CARRIE	"Of course you did, sweetie. You don't say that to her."
JACK	"Oh, I'm sorry. I was just trying to be funny."
CARRIE	"Well, it wasn't funny."
JACK	"Yeah, it wasn't funny, I'm a slacker."
JACK	"I guess if I wear a top side, I wouldn't be here."
WAITER	Good evening. You folks are ready to order?
CARRIE	Um... yes!
CARRIE	"Let's see, um,..."
CARRIE	I'm going to start with goat cheese salad and
CARRIE	"then I'll have the tuna but, sir,"
CARRIE	can you make sure there's no parsley on anything?
CARRIE	I'm just really allergic. Not even a sprinkling ever on the plate.
JACK	"Hey, he got it. No parsley."
CARRIE	"and, can... actually can, uh,..."
CARRIE	can you ask the chef if the marinade for the tuna has parsley in it?
CARRIE	Because if it does I should probably change my order.
WAITER	I'll go check.
CARRIE	Thank you.
JACK	You're not allergic.
CARRIE	What?
JACK	You're not allergic.
CARRIE	I don't like it!
JACK	Why don't you just say that?
CARRIE	"Because when I say that, parsley somehow,"
CARRIE	magically appears on the plate and I feel bad
CARRIE	because I have to send it back.
JACK	You didn't even order something that usually comes with parsley.
CARRIE	It comes with everything.
CHARLOTTE	"You know what? Guys, I actually have to"
CHARLOTTE	I... I totally forgot I... I have to
CHARLOTTE	"uh,... go."
CHARLOTTE	Bye.
CARRIE	Charlotte decided to leave her second bad date of the night.
JACK	"Uh, you can just drop us at the corner of uh 73rd and Madison. Thanks"
CARRIE	"Whoa, actually, can you go around at 73rd between Park and Madison?Thank you."
CARRIE	I'm in heels.
JACK	I can't believe you put me down in front of your friend.
CARRIE	I didn't put you down.
JACK	"Oh, okay, great."
JACK	Now you're going to tell me what I feel?
CARRIE	I'm not telling you what you feel.
JACK	"Ah, here we go again."
CARRIE	What's going on with us?
JACK	When did you stop being on my side?
CARRIE	When did you stop being on my side?
CARRIE	This isn't working.
JACK	You're right.
JACK	I think we should take a break.
CARRIE	Are you serious?
JACK	I think we need some time apart.
CARRIE	"Well, nothings haven't been great but..."
CARRIE	How long have you been thinking about this?
JACK	Right up here's fine.
JACK	At third brownstone on the right.
JACK	"Ah no, actually wait. There's going to be 2 stops."
CARRIE	"Wait, you want to take the break starting now?"
CARRIE	I thought you would at least come up and we need to talk.
JACK	I... I don't need to talk.
JACK	Ok? I need some time to think.
CARRIE	"Well, how much time?"
JACK	About a week?
JACK	I'm going to go out to my Hamptons house.
JACK	I just need some distance.
JACK	sort through stuffs. Is that okay?
CARRIE	What?
CARRIE	I'm supposed to decide what I feel about this with the meter runnung?
CARRIE	"Yeah, okay. Go."
JACK	I'll call you when I get back.
CARRIE	"Well, thanks for dinner!"
CARRIE	I knew we were having problems but a break?
CARRIE	What am I? Some horrible job he needs to get away from?
CHARLOTTE	A break isn't always a bad thing.
CARRIE	"Oh, come on it's a hop, skip and a week from a break up."
CHARLOTTE	Or it's the thing that saves you from saying the things that you wish you could take back
CHARLOTTE	but you can't!
CHARLOTTE	"If Harry and I had taken a break, then maybe I wouldn't be out on blind dates again."
CARRIE	"Hey, remember when a break was a good thing?"
CARRIE	"Spring break, coffee break,..."
CARRIE	Now it's break-up.
CARRIE	Break down.
CARRIE	They keep getting worse. What's next?
IRANDA	Hip break?
SAMANTHA	You know what I think?
SAMANTHA	"I think ""Don't do that. """
CARRIE	Do what?
CARRIE	"Well, I'm sorry I'm upset."
SAMANTHA	"Well, don't be."
SAMANTHA	You'll be even more upset when your faces are all lined.
SAMANTHA	"As far as I'm concerned, the test of a good relationship is"
SAMANTHA	are you like this... or like this...?
CHARLOTTE	That is the test of a good relationship?
SAMANTHA	Um-hmm.
IRANDA	Or good a dermatologist.
SAMANTHA	Make fun but a bump in the road is never good.
SAMANTHA	And you shouldn't bother staying around to find out how not good.
CARRIE	"Well, it's not all frowns."
CARRIE	Berger and I have a lot of good stuff too. It's complicated.
CARRIE	Complicated by the fact that the man had to go all the way to Long Island to think this through.
SAMANTHA	Maybe you can send him a postcard!
IRANDA	That is the most blatant agenda pushing I have ever seen.
CARRIE	And the most effective.
CHARLOTTE	Wow!
CARRIE	I just wish I knew what he was thinking.
SAMANTHA	"Oh, who cares? Look at his pecs."
CARRIE	I meant Berger.
CARRIE	It's so frustrating. What am I supposed to do?
CARRIE	"Just sit around, waiting to find out whether he chooses me?"
CARRIE	I'm doing that all day at Jury duty and it sucks!
SAMANTHA	Here's an idea.
SAMANTHA	Why don't you use this time to think about what you want.
SAMANTHA	Remember you? What do you want?
CARRIE	The next day I got to thinking about trials and trial separations.
CARRIE	"In a court room, a jury decides the outcome."
CARRIE	"In a relationship, the victims have to decide their own fate."
CARRIE	How can 2 people mired in the mess ever figure it out?
CARRIE	Do we need distance to get close?
IRANDA	Sorry. Cab gridlock situation.
IRANDA	They should rename the west side highway the no way highway.
IRANDA	Ah... let me just pull out my files on the McKenzie case.
AURICE WHITE	We're not here to discuss the McKenzie case.
IRANDA	I'm sorry then. What is this meeting about?
AURICE WHITE	You.
AURICE WHITE	We're concerned.
AURICE WHITE	It's been noted recently that you've been late to important meetings and struggling to handle your case load.
IRANDA	"I'm sorry, Maurice. I don't know what you mean."
IRANDA	"I was late today, but..."
FERN	"Actually,"
FERN	you've been late rather frequently. There was
FERN	the deposition last Tuesday and the motion hearing last Friday
FERN	and you left early on Monday
IRANDA	"Way to watch my back, Fern."
AURICE WHITE	I understand it's been difficult.
FERN	With the new baby and all.
IRANDA	Got it.
IRANDA	No problem. Won't happen again.
IRANDA	"But let me say as far as the McKenzie brief, Miranda Hobbs' kicking ass."
IRANDA	Where I'm doing a bad job is at home.
IRANDA	"So, if you'll excuse me, I have work to do."
IRANDA	"And may I remind you that when my mother died, I was back in the office on Monday."
SAMANTHA	Guess what I'm drinking.
SAMANTHA	An absolute hunk. Your drink!
SAMANTHA	And you're delici...
SAMANTHA	Take off that ski cap.
SAMANTHA	Let people see you.
SMITH	I don't want people to see me.
SMITH	Everybody's giving me shit about the poster.
SAMANTHA	"Oh, you're insane. People love it!"
SMITH	Not my people.
SMITH	My sober buddies are pissed that I'm shelling for liquor company.
SMITH	My acting class thinks I'm a sell.
SMITH	My Ma's running around every grocery store in Seattle
SMITH	hiding magazines so my 96 year old grand mother doesn't see my dick.
SAMANTHA	"Drunks, nobodies, prudes."
SMITH	And I just don't see where this is going.
SMITH	"For one thing, I was getting auditions."
SMITH	But nothing's happening.
GAY GUY	I'm sorry to bother you but
GAY GUY	Are you the absolute hunk?
SAMANTHA	Yes! He is!
GAY GUY	"I just wanted to say that my friends and I are huge, huge fans."
SAMANTHA	It's working! What did I tell you?
SMITH	How dose those guys toasting me mean my acting career's happening?
SAMANTHA	First come the gays then the girls
SAMANTHA	Then... the industry.
(MALE)	Cheers
SAMANTHA	Cheers
CARRIE	"And speaking of absolute gay,"
CARRIE	Charlotte was on a lunch date with Yenta number 2's son.
JONATHAN	So... I mean I guess I just knew it wasn't going to work out.
JONATHAN	I mean I like practicing pilates but I don't want to talk about it at all day with my significant other.
CHARLOTTE	And... what are you looking for exactly in a
CHARLOTTE	significant other?
JONATHAN	Look.... We don't need to do this.
JONATHAN	I mean you know I'm gay.
JONATHAN	I know I'm gay.
JONATHAN	The only person who doesn't know I'm gay is my mother.
JONATHAN	So do you really want to know what my type is?
JONATHAN	That's it.
CHARLOTTE	I know him!
JONATHAN	Get out!
JONATHAN	Get out!
JONATHAN	Could you introduce me?
CHARLOTTE	Actually he's straight.
JONATHAN	Oh...
JONATHAN	My brother will be so disappointed. We're obsessed with him.
ELAINE	"Charlotte, honey."
CHARLOTTE	Hi Elaine
ELAINE	You went out with Fagel and Miskite and you can't go out with my David?
CHARLOTTE	It's just these blind dates are so...
ELAINE	"Hey, not so blind!"
ELAINE	I showed David your picture from the last newsletter
ELAINE	and he thought you were a knockout!
CHARLOTTE	"Well, that's nice."
ELAINE	I told him you'd be at the next single in Mingle night at the temple
ELAINE	You could meet there.
ELAINE	He's a looker! My David.
ELAINE	Now I know most people say that about their childeren but he is.
ELAINE	and he's even better looking in person.
ELAINE	So you'll meet him.
ELAINE	Never had braces. Can you imagine?
CARRIE	Some people are bullied into blind dating
CARRIE	Charlotte was bubbied.
IRANDA	I'm here!
IRANDA	I'm here!
IRANDA	Is he still awake?
AGDA	"No, no, no."
AGDA	The boy got to sleep an hour ago.
IRANDA	Great! It's great!
IRANDA	"Well, I just guess I can stay here and get back to my work then."
CARRIE	That night the only thing Miranda put to bed was the McKenzie brief.
CARRIE	The next day the verdict was in.
CARRIE	"Century 21, the downtown discount store was the best part of jury duty."
CARRIE	Hello.
BIG	I'm with 2 men in plaid pants and I'm carrying a 9 iron.
BIG	Greetings from California.
CARRIE	"Ah, you think that's bad? I'm discount shopping."
CARRIE	What are you doing golfing?
BIG	I'm just in it for the scotch afterwards.
BIG	How are things?
CARRIE	"Ah, pretty good so far. I found the most unbelievable Anna Molinari dress"
CARRIE	and a Dolce Kimono.
BIG	I meant in your life.
BIG	How's tricks?
CARRIE	Tricks are for kids.
BIG	"Ok, kid."
BIG	"So how's it going with that guy, hot dog?"
CARRIE	Berger. Why do you ask?
BIG	Because we're friends and
BIG	friends ask other friends how things are in their lives.
BIG	besides I don't tee off another for 10 minutes.
CARRIE	"Ah, we're great! Great!"
BIG	Moved in together yet?
CARRIE	Um... actually we're taking it slow.
BIG	What's that mean?
CARRIE	"Well, we're kind of taking a break."
BIG	You're taking a break?
CARRIE	A little break.
CARRIE	I don't know why I told him. I think I crumbled under questioning.
BIG	You haven't been together that long. What are you taking a break from?
CARRIE	"Well, sometimes a person needs a little space."
BIG	From you? This guy must be crazy.
CARRIE	"Spoken by the man who moved 3,000 miles away."
CARRIE	"You know, a break can be a very good thing."
BIG	As long as you're alright with it.
CARRIE	I am very okay with it. In fact...
BIG	You're breaking up.
CARRIE	"No, we're not! Berger and I will figure..."
BIG	"No, your cell phone is..."
BIG	breaking up. I can hardly hear you.
CARRIE	Hello?
CARRIE	"With an armful of discount clothing, I realized I could no longer discount my feelings."
CARRIE	I decided to rent a car
CARRIE	and drive the distance to get closer to Berger.
CARRIE	I paid 187 dollars to drive 40 feet.
CARRIE	What did I think I was going to do?
CARRIE	Badger my boyfriend into being with me?
IRANDA	"Well, that's one option."
CARRIE	"I just keep thinking you know if I, if I stick with it,..."
CARRIE	just try a little harder...
IRANDA	Carrie.
IRANDA	You know how much I like Berger but come on.
IRANDA	No one can accuse you of not having tried.
IRANDA	You did good.
CARRIE	I mean Berger can be...
CARRIE	threatened and...
CARRIE	insecure and somtimes he shuts down but
CARRIE	but he's also smart and funny like
CARRIE	"he made up this thing,..."
CARRIE	"this, this Holywood kiss thing"
CARRIE	whenever we're being pissy with each other
CARRIE	we did this fake Hollywood kiss bit.
CARRIE	That makes us laugh.
IRANDA	You guys need a bit?
CARRIE	I know. It isn't working.
IRANDA	Why is it so hard to admit that?
CARRIE	"God, I've got to break up with him."
CARRIE	If he ever comes back.
AGDA	All clean. Here's the mommy.
IRANDA	"Hey, guy! How was your bath?"
IRANDA	"Magda, see you at eight tomorrow. Thank you for everything."
IRANDA	It's okay.
IRANDA	Don't cry. Magda will be back tomorrow.
IRANDA	"Hey, I missed you today."
IRANDA	How are you?
AGDA	"Bye bye, Brady."
AGDA	No no crying. Oh you darling. Bye bye.
CARRIE	What's wrong with him?
IRANDA	"Oh, he'll be fine. He just misses his mommy."
IRANDA	Magda. It's okay.
CARRIE	The next day Miranda decided to do something about that.
IRANDA	We both know that this isn't working.
IRANDA	"and as much as I would like it to, it's not just going to magically change."
AURICE WHITE	What are you saying?
IRANDA	I can't keep working like this.
IRANDA	I'm going to have to cut way back.
IRANDA	To 50 hours a week.
IRANDA	55 tops.
CARRIE	That night Miranda was there to put Brady to bed.
CARRIE	but there would still be times when she wouldn't be around.
CARRIE	"so Miranda found a way to be... a ""round""."
CARRIE	"And at bus stops, all around town"
SMITH	Fuckin' eh.
SMITH	Everybody in New York thinks I'm an asshole.
SAMANTHA	"Listen, blondie."
SAMANTHA	If you're going to be in this business you're going to have to be a lot more thick skinned than this.
SMITH	What business? Naked hustle business?
SAMANTHA	"Ok, I understand you're upset but you're going to have to take a step backwards"
SAMANTHA	and see the big picture!
SMITH	I need some time to think. I'll see you later.
SAMANTHA	Stop right there.
SAMANTHA	So there's a bump on the road.
SAMANTHA	You can't bail the minute things get rough.
SAMANTHA	Now trust me. This will all work out.
SMITH	What if you're wrong?
CARRIE	There it was. A frown.
CARRIE	Or as close to a frown as Samantha and her dermatologist doctor Peterson would allow.
CATHOLIC SCHOOL GIRL	Oh my God! Look! There he is! The absolute hunk!
SAMANTHA	"What did I tell you? First, the gays, now the girls!"
CARRIE	"A hop, skip and a week later, the industry followed."
CARRIE	Gus Fiansent offered Smith a part of a model / hustler / junkie in his latest movie.
CARRIE	which he happily accepted.
DAVID	So you grew up in Connecticut? I went to school there.
CHARLOTTE	Really? Where did you go?
DAVID	Yale.
CHARLOTTE	Oh
DAVID	Something wrong with Yale?
CHARLOTTE	"No, no, it's just..."
CHARLOTTE	Yale.
CARRIE	Charlotte knew how silly she sounded
CARRIE	The problem wasn't that David went to Yale.
CARRIE	The problem was... he wasn't Harry.
CHARLOTTE	David
CHARLOTTE	You're really nice and
CHARLOTTE	in fact... you're perfect.
CHARLOTTE	"but for where I am right now, you might as well be a gay man with carnations."
DAVID	I'm sorry?
CHARLOTTE	I'm just not ready to date.
DAVID	Okay.
DAVID	You want to go back to my apartment and have sex?
CHARLOTTE	No.
DAVID	"Well, I think it was worth asking."
DAVID	Okay. I think I'm going to head out. Bye.
JEWISH SINGLE #1	This blows! The only cute guy just left.
JEWISH SINGLE #2	All that's left is the fatties and the baldies.
CARRIE	Charlotte could only hope that one of the baldies was her baldie.
HARRY	"Out of all the synagogues and all the cities, you had to walk into mine."
CHARLOTTE	Harry .
HARRY	How you've been?
CHARLOTTE	Not good.
CHARLOTTE	I miss you.
CHARLOTTE	And... being away from you just only made it all the more clear how much I love you.
HARRY 	Charlotte
CHARLOTTE	Wait!
CHARLOTTE	Let me finish.
CHARLOTTE	I don't care if you ever marry me.
CHARLOTTE	I just want to be with you.
CHARLOTTE	I would be lucky... to have you.
CHARLOTTE	"So if you can find some way to forgive me, if you could just call me,"
CHARLOTTE	or just ask me out again.
HARRY 	"Well, that's not good enough."
HARRY 	Charlotte York.
HARRY 	Will you marry me?
CHARLOTTE	Yes!
CHARLOTTE	"Yes, I'll marry you."
JEWISH SINGLE #1	I am so coming back next week!
CARRIE	It wasn't a pineapple but it was just as weird.
CARRIE	and there was only one other person who would really appreciate it.
CARRIE	"At that moment,"
CARRIE	I knew I wasn't ready to let Berger go.
(FEMALE)	"Ok, people. You're released."
CARRIE	Who is it?
JACK	It's me. I'm back.
CARRIE	"Oh, well, come on up."
CARRIE	"When it comes to a trial, you have to listen to the evidence."
CARRIE	"But when it comes to the trials of love, you have to listen to your heart."
CARRIE	I didn't know what Berger's verdict would be
CARRIE	but I knew mine.
JACK	I hear they're making a come-back.
CARRIE	"Hey, Berger. I know things have been bad but I really think..."
JACK	I know.
JACK	"I love you, Carrie."
CARRIE	I want to try to make this work.
CARRIE	"Hey, you're never going to believe it. Do you know the mango guy?"
CARRIE	He pulled out...
JACK	A pineapple?
CARRIE	A coconut.
JACK	Ah... so close.
CARRIE	I know!
CARRIE	New York City is a great place to be engaged.
WOMAN	Miss?
CHARLOTTE	I'm sorry. Did you want this cab?
WOMAN	"Why, Thank you."
CHARLOTTE	Sure.
CARRIE	And it's an even better place to be enraged.
CARRIE	You're so busy!
CARRIE	"boy, do I have news."
CHARLOTTE	So do I.
CHARLOTTE	I didn't want to say anything until we were all together but Harry and I made up and he asked me to marry him.
IRANDA	"Oh, my god."
IRANDA	Congratulations!
CARRIE	That's great.
SAMANTHA	Look at that ring.
CHARLOTTE	I know.
CHARLOTTE	He had it made based on the one that Richard Burton gave Elizabeth Taylor.
CARRIE	"Well, it is fabulous."
SAMANTHA	Even more fabulous than your first one.
CHARLOTTE	"So, Carrie, what was your news?"
CARRIE	Berger broke up with me on a Post-it.
IRANDA	On a Post-it?
CARRIE	Yep.
CARRIE	"Read it and weep, my friends."
SAMANTHA	"""I'm sorry."
SAMANTHA	I can't.
SAMANTHA	"Don't hate me""."
SAMANTHA	The motherfucker's concise.
IRANDA	I thought you were going to break up with him.
CARRIE	"Yeah, I was, and I should have but he said that he wanted to try to work things out: A.k.a. Leave in the middle of the night."
CHARLOTTE	A Post-it.
CHARLOTTE	That's infuriating.
CARRIE	I remember when breaking up over the phone was considered bad form.
IRANDA	I once was broken up with by a guy's doorman.
IRANDA	"""I'm sorry, Miss Hobbes."
IRANDA	"Jonathan won't be coming down, ever."""
SAMANTHA	I miss having a doorman.
CHARLOTTE	are You gonna call him?
CARRIE	no.
CARRIE	I am not going to dignify his behavior with a response.
CARRIE	I am not even going to leave him one of those angry answering machine messages.
CARRIE	"""Hi, it's me."
CARRIE	"You're a dick!"""
CARRIE	"But it sure felt good saying it right now, even to you."
SAMANTHA	That's what we're here for.
CHARLOTTE	I'm sorry.
CARRIE	"Yeah, I'm sorry, too."
CARRIE	That relationship was a complete waste of time.
CHARLOTTE	It's never a complete waste of time.
CHARLOTTE	"Even in the worst relationship, you always learn something."
CARRIE	You might not wanna say that to a woman carrying a loaded Post-it.
CHARLOTTE	"But everything happens for a reason, even if you don't know what it is yet."
IRANDA	That's such bullshit.
CHARLOTTE	It's not.
CHARLOTTE	Look at me.
CHARLOTTE	"If I had never married Trey, then I never would have gotten divorced and I would have never met my divorce lawyer, Harry and I wouldn't be engaged now."
CARRIE	Paper covers rock.
CARRIE	Maybe everything does happen for a reason.
CARRIE	If Berger hadn't left me in the most horrible way anyone could ever imagine I wouldn't be free to walk you to your hair appointment.
SAMANTHA	We're all being protected by the universe.
CARRIE	"When it comes to men, you may have had it right all along."
CARRIE	Keep it light.
CARRIE	Don't get too involved.
CARRIE	Don't get too hurt.
SAMANTHA	Exactly.
SAMANTHA	"If you're never someone's girlfriend, you can never be someone's ex-girlfriend."
CARRIE	You know what? I'm gonna spend as much time mourning this relationship as he spent ending it.
CARRIE	"Okay, I'm over it."
CARRIE	Let's go somewhere fantastic tonight and have a fantastic time.
CARRIE	What can we do that would be fantastic? I know.
SAMANTHA	I'm taking you to Bed.
CARRIE	I'm not that off men.
SAMANTHA	"No, Bed."
SAMANTHA	It's a new club opening tonight.
SAMANTHA	We'll all go.
SAMANTHA	I think I have the invitation.
CARRIE	Listen to me being all hurt.
CARRIE	"Look how many men have broken up with you, and you're fine."
CARRIE	"""Come to Bed"". Wow."
CARRIE	People say everything happens for a reason.
CARRIE	These people are usually women.
CARRIE	And these women are usually sorting through a break-up.
CARRIE	It seems that men can get out of a relationship without even a goodbye.
CARRIE	"But apparently, women have to either get married or learn something."
CARRIE	Why are we in such a rush to move from confused to Confucius?
CARRIE	Do we search for lessons to lessen the pain?
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, Samantha was at home dressing a man, for a change."
SAMANTHA	"I called some designers and I told them that the Absolut Hunk was going to do TRL on MTV, and they jumped ASAP."
SAMANTHA	"Gucci, YSL, D&G."
SAMANTHA	Take your pick.
SMITH	"You know, I'm not really comfortable wearing labels."
SMITH	"If it's okay with you, I thought I'd just wear some jeans and this."
SAMANTHA	"That'll work, too."
SAMANTHA	You are going to be the fantasy of every adolescent girl and sexually confused boy in America.
SMITH	How'd I get hooked up with such an amazing girlfriend?
CARRIE	And that was a label Samantha wasn't comfortable wearing.
SAMANTHA	You should get ready.
SAMANTHA	The car will be here any minute.
SMITH	You sure you can't come?
SAMANTHA	I can't.
SAMANTHA	I promised Carrie and the girls.
SAMANTHA	But I will catch the replay tonight.
SMITH	should I hook up with You later?
SAMANTHA	no.
SAMANTHA	Go out with the MTV crowd and have fun.
SAMANTHA	You're the Absolut Hunk.
SAMANTHA	Work it.
SAMANTHA	"And as your publicist, let me just say calling someone your girlfriend isn't a good idea right now."
SMITH	"someone, Or you?"
SAMANTHA	Either way.
SAMANTHA	So when anyone asks if you have a girlfriend you should say you are still looking and haven't found anyone special yet.
SMITH	That's what you want?
SAMANTHA	That's what I want.
SMITH	Samantha.
SAMANTHA	But I do insist you top up that tank with some Dior sunglasses.
SAMANTHA	It's MTV.
SAMANTHA	If you're not wearing something the kids can't afford how will they know to look up to you? There.
SAMANTHA	Much better.
CARRIE	"That night, as Charlotte was deciding what to wear she noticed that everything went with her new engagement ring except her old wedding dress."
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, in another closet"
IRANDA	I don't think I can go.
IRANDA	I'm not feeling so hot.
CARRIE	are You sick?
IRANDA	"No, I mean, literally."
IRANDA	"Openings of hot new clubs are for hot, childless people."
IRANDA	I'm not even one of the hot mommies at Mommy & Me.
CARRIE	I don't want to have to resort to this.
CARRIE	"But if I have to, I will play the Post-it card."
IRANDA	Just explain to me why I have to leave my house to go to Bed.
CARRIE	Because this can't be the day that I was broken up with by a Post-it.
CARRIE	This has to be the day that something else happened.
IRANDA	How about the day your friend discovered all her clothes are covered in spit-up?
CARRIE	You are going.
CARRIE	No excuses.
IRANDA	Okay.
CARRIE	"And speaking of no excuses, there they were."
CARRIE	her skinny jeans.
CARRIE	The jeans every woman keeps in the vain hope that someday she'll fit into them again.
IRANDA	"Ladies, this is a miracle."
IRANDA	I am in my skinny jeans.
IRANDA	I haven't fit into these since 1985 and that is only because I had mono.
SAMANTHA	"Miranda, I've never noticed before, but you've got one hot ass."
IRANDA	Really?
SAMANTHA	Yeah!
CARRIE	and You look Good.
CHARLOTTE	How'd you do it?
IRANDA	"I got pregnant, became a single mother, and stopped having any time to eat."
SAMANTHA	That's a diet I won't be trying.
IRANDA	I can't believe I am in my skinny jeans.
IRANDA	I am never taking them off.
IRANDA	"Charlotte, can I wear these to your wedding?"
IRANDA	I'm kidding.
CHARLOTTE	"No, it's just I just feel kind of silly that I made such a big fuss about my ring earlier."
SAMANTHA	"Honey, a diamond that big deserves a parade."
CHARLOTTE	But this is the second time around.
CHARLOTTE	I already did the showing of the ring and the big wedding.
CHARLOTTE	You were there.
CARRIE	It was lovely.
CHARLOTTE	So this time I've decided that it should just be really small and tasteful.
IRANDA	So No denim?
CHARLOTTE	Right.
CHARLOTTE	And I don't want to disappoint you: I've decided not to have bridesmaids.
CARRIE	Hallelujah!
SAMANTHA	"Okay, let's go to Bed."
CARRIE	Since people often go to bars to try to get someone into bed it was only a matter of time till someone cut out the middleman and put the beds in bars.
SAMANTHA	Now this is my kind of place.
CARRIE	And I thought they were being ironic.
IRANDA	"If I had known it was gonna be like this, I would have brought my bite guard."
CHARLOTTE	"bed for four, please."
HOSTESS	All the beds are booked Right now.
CARRIE	"Damn, that always happens to me."
SAMANTHA	We're on the VIP list.
SAMANTHA	Samantha Jones.
SAMANTHA	Perfect.
IRANDA	I'll be right back.
IRANDA	I have to find a bathroom.
IRANDA	I need to pee.
CARRIE	Really?
CARRIE	Or do you just wanna stare at your ass in the mirror?
IRANDA	"Well, that, too."
SAMANTHA	"Shake it, sister."
HOSTESS	We're ready.
HOSTESS	Follow me.
CARRIE	That was fast.
SAMANTHA	"What can I say, I know how to work it in Bed."
PETER	And I didn't even have to buy you dinner.
IRANDA	"I'm sorry, someone pushed me."
PETER	You want me to have them killed?
IRANDA	Would you?
PETER	Just say when.
IRANDA	when.
PETER	"Okay, I'm bluffing."
IRANDA	"Yeah, I knew you were all talk."
PETER	Yeah.
PETER	I'm Peter.
IRANDA	Miranda.
IRANDA	And thank you for letting me crash.
PETER	Why don't you hang out? It's not that often I have such a beautiful woman in bed with me.
IRANDA	"Okay, but move over."
IRANDA	That's my side.
SAMANTHA	All the men in here seem kind of old.
CHARLOTTE	That's because you're dating Smith.
CARRIE	Who's basically a zygote.
SAMANTHA	"I'm not dating him, I'm fucking him."
SAMANTHA	Now I'm looking for someone else to fuck.
CARRIE	"Well, I think you may have come to the right place."
CARRIE	"Oh, no."
CARRIE	It's Berger's friend.
SAMANTHA	Where?
CARRIE	in the Next bed.
CARRIE	"God, I hate New York."
CARRIE	Is there no other club opening tonight?
CARRIE	What should I do?
SAMANTHA	ignore them.
CARRIE	"No, I can't."
CARRIE	It'll get back to Berger that I acted childish.
CHARLOTTE	Just go over there and say hi.
CHARLOTTE	Act like Berger is the last thing on your mind.
CARRIE	Right.
CARRIE	I'll take the high road.
CARRIE	"I'll be calm, classy, and just say hello."
CARRIE	"Billy, Hi."
BILLY	"Hey, Carrie."
CARRIE	"Hi, how are you?"
BILLY	fucking great.
BILLY	"Chris, Andrew, this is Berger's girlfriend, Carrie."
BILLY	Is Berger with you?
CARRIE	This is kind of uncomfortable but we broke up this morning.
BILLY	I'm sorry to hear that.
BILLY	"Yeah, I knew you guys had all kinds of problems."
CARRIE	Yeah.
CARRIE	And he was bad in bed.
CARRIE	"You look great, Billy."
CARRIE	You know that angry message I didn't wanna leave on Berger's machine? I just left it on his friend.
SAMANTHA	What happened?
CARRIE	I took the lowest possible road.
CARRIE	"I told him Berger was bad in bed, which isn't even true."
CARRIE	Two times!
CARRIE	Don't you forget anything?
CHARLOTTE	Why did you say that?
CARRIE	It just came out.
SAMANTHA	It's understandable.
SAMANTHA	You're suffering from Post-it traumatic stress syndrome.
CARRIE	I need to find a way to erase that message.
CHARLOTTE	Go back over there and explain.
CHARLOTTE	Just tell them you're hurt and that you didn't mean it.
CARRIE	"Great, now I have to admit that I'm hurt?"
SAMANTHA	"First, a little nerve Clicquot."
CARRIE	That thing I said before terrible and not true.
CARRIE	He was fine in bed.
CARRIE	"Great, in fact."
CARRIE	"Fireworks, rockets."
CARRIE	I don't even know why I said that.
CARRIE	"I'm hurt, okay?"
BILLY	Sure.
BILLY	Break-ups are tough.
CARRIE	"Yes, under normal circumstances they are tough."
CARRIE	"And in this case, tougher."
CARRIE	"Look, I don't wanna drag you into this but Berger broke up with me on a Post-it."
CARRIE	"I know as Berger's friend you can't have a normal reaction but just so you know, the normal reaction has been"
CARRIE	"Not that I'm going around telling everyone, just some girlfriends."
CARRIE	"You know, I'm trying to understand why someone would do that."
BILLY	"Well, Maybe he was afraid."
CARRIE	interesting.
CARRIE	How so?
BILLY	Women can get really angry.
CARRIE	"I assure you, I would have been very understanding."
ANDREW	Right.
CARRIE	Excuse me?
ANDREW	"You all say that, but then you just freak and get all psycho-bitch."
CARRIE	Really?
CARRIE	So now it's our fault?
BILLY	"All we're saying is there really is no good way to break up with someone, is there?"
CARRIE	"It's funny you should mention that, Billy, because actually, there is."
CARRIE	You can have the guts and the courtesy to tell a woman to her face that you no longer wanna see her.
CARRIE	"Call me crazy but I think that you can make a point of ending your relationship in a manner that does not include an e-mail, a doorman, or a missing persons report."
CARRIE	I think you could all get over your fear of looking like the bad guy and actually have the uncomfortable break-up conversation because here's what:
CARRIE	Avoiding that is what makes you the bad guy.
CARRIE	"and Just So You know, Alan"
ANDREW	Andrew.
CARRIE	"Most women aren't angry, irrational psychos."
CARRIE	We just want an ending to a relationship that is thoughtful and decent and honors what we had together.
CARRIE	"So my point, Billy, is this: There is a good way to break up with someone and it doesn't include a Post-it!"
BILLY	Okay.
SAMANTHA	Much better.
CARRIE	You think?
CARRIE	We have to get out of here immediately.
PETER	"So, what, you have a boyfriend?"
IRANDA	"me, no."
PETER	Right.
IRANDA	I don't.
PETER	"Come on, how's that possible?"
IRANDA	I have no idea.
PETER	"Well, neither do I."
IRANDA	You're hot.
CARRIE	"Hi, sorry."
CARRIE	We're leaving.
CARRIE	I just learned you should never go to Bed angry.
IRANDA	Well
PETER	It was really Great meeting you.
IRANDA	It was good to meet you.
IRANDA	I'll see you.
IRANDA	and Thanks.
PETER	for what?
CARRIE	"Okay, so I'm angry."
CARRIE	So those guys will tell Berger that I'm angry.
CARRIE	I can live with that.
GUYS	"Come on, bro, give me a hit."
GUYS	"You wanna pass that back? Be good, ladies."
CARRIE	do You smell that?
SAMANTHA	Pot.
CARRIE	Let's get high.
SAMANTHA	I'd get high.
CHARLOTTE	"Wait, are you serious?"
CARRIE	"Yes, that's exactly what my mind needs: Cloudiness."
CARRIE	I'm still too lucid on the facts of the day and night.
CARRIE	When was the last time you smoked pot?
IRANDA	I think I was wearing these jeans.
CHARLOTTE	I'm not smoking pot.
CARRIE	Post-it.
CHARLOTTE	How do we even get any?
SAMANTHA	"I'd call my dealer, but he's at the Cape."
CARRIE	Damn those dealers and their summer houses.
IRANDA	I'll ask those guys.
IRANDA	"Excuse me, fellas."
IRANDA	My friends and I were wondering
SAMANTHA	I like her in those jeans.
CHARLOTTE	Is it safe to buy pot from strangers?
CARRIE	They're not strangers.
CARRIE	They're our new friends with pot.
GUYS	Okay.
GUYS	"You're such an idiot, dude."
IRANDA	They're going around the corner to Drown the Hound.
IRANDA	There's a guy there who deals.
IRANDA	And I get the one with the glasses.
CARRIE	"My, when she scores, she scores."
CARRIE	"""Drown the Hound."""
CARRIE	And I thought they were being ironic.
IRANDA	I see our guys.
CARRIE	Yeah! Go get 'em.
CHARLOTTE	"If that last place was called ""Bed,"" then this should be called ""Smell."""
SAMANTHA	Hold your nose.
SAMANTHA	I promised Smith I'd watch him on TRL and this dump has a TV.
CHARLOTTE	What have they got All over the floor?
CARRIE	Peanut shells.
CHARLOTTE	Why?
CARRIE	I don't know.
CARRIE	Do peanut shells have to happen for a reason?
BARTENDER	What can I get you?
SAMANTHA	Here's $20.
SAMANTHA	"I assume, in a place like this, that covers three drinks and a channel change."
BACHELORETTE #1	Does the bride need another Jell-O shot?
BRIDE	"No, I can't!"
BACHELORETTES	Yes! Great! One More!
CARRIE	"Look at them, so happy."
CARRIE	"Hey, sweetie, what's wrong?"
CHARLOTTE	I just I wish I'd never been married before.
CARRIE	"But if you hadn't married Trey, you wouldn't have met Harry."
CHARLOTTE	I know.
CHARLOTTE	It's just I hate that this is my second ring.
CHARLOTTE	And that this is my second marriage.
CHARLOTTE	"I hate that I finally found the love of my life and I can't celebrate it in a big, big way."
CARRIE	You can do whatever you want.
CHARLOTTE	"No, I can't."
CHARLOTTE	It's inappropriate.
BACHELORETTE # 2	"Excuse me, hi."
BACHELORETTE # 2	Would you take a picture of me and my girlfriends? She's getting married.
CHARLOTTE	Sure.
BACHELORETTE # 2	Thank you.
CARRIE	"You know, she got engaged last night."
BRIDE	Congratulations.
CHARLOTTE	"No, it's my second."
CARRIE	She's getting married to a wonderful man.
CARRIE	And look at this rock.
BACHELORETTES	"Oh, wow!"
BRIDE	It's beautiful.
CHARLOTTE	Thank you.
BRIDE	You have to be in the picture.
CHARLOTTE	That's okay.
BACHELORETTES	Come on.
CARRIE	Got the camera.
CARRIE	"All right, everyone say ""bride."""
ALL	Bride!
BRIDE	when are You getting married?
BACHELORETTES	What's the dress like? Where's the reception?
CARRIE	"Finally, Charlotte's inner judge was silenced by some very loud bachelorettes."
ETHAN	"Sorry, I guess he's not here tonight."
IRANDA	"Well, you can't cry over spilt pot."
DAVE	I can buy You a drink.
FRIEND	"I said I was buying her a Drink, dude."
DAVE	You have a girlfriend.
IRANDA	"Gentlemen, please."
CARRIE	That's the secret of the skinny jeans.
CARRIE	It's not so much a state of behind as a state of mind.
AN	What do I gotta do to get a beer around here?
LA LA	"Hey, what's up!"
LA LA	"I'm La La, and now you've seen him naked on a billboard right here in Times Square."
LA LA	And now he's on TRL wearing clothes.
LA LA	"Damn, but it's still all good."
LA LA	"He is the absolute hottest, the absolute awesome the Absolut Hunk!"
LA LA	Give it up for Smith!
LA LA	"Man, we have a lot of fans in the house."
LA LA	Let's get right to some questions.
AMBER	"Hi, I'm Amber."
SMITH	"Hey, what's up, Amber?"
SAMANTHA	"Nice, relaxed, sexy, and modest."
AMBER	One.
AMBER	What is it like to be the Absolut Hunk?
SMITH	I have to say it's been a real trip.
SMITH	I've met some really awesome people.
FRANKIE	You're hot enough to be on TV.
SAMANTHA	take That to the dartboard.
AMBER	And two.
AMBER	Do you have a girlfriend?
SMITH	"No, I'm still looking."
LA LA	For real?
LA LA	You're not dating anyone?
SMITH	"I am dating, but I'm not seeing anyone special."
CARRIE	"And even though Samantha had designed it herself she realized ""no one special"" was another label she didn't care for."
SAMANTHA	I changed my mind.
SAMANTHA	Kiss me.
CARRIE	And to prove that Smith was no one special to her she kissed someone even less special.
CARRIE	"Unfortunately, he was someone special to a somewhat drunk person."
GRACIE	What the fuck do you think you're doing?
CORRINE	What happened?
GRACIE	she kissed Frankie.
NICOLE	Who the fuck do you think you are?
ANNA	"Fucking city girls, you think you're such hot shit that you can go around kissing other girls' boyfriends?"
GRACIE	I'm gonna kick your ass.
CORRINE	I'm gonna slap the shit out of you.
CARRIE	"Oh, my God!"
SAMANTHA	Relax.
NICOLE	You fucking relax.
GRACIE	"If I ever fucking see you again I'm gonna put my shoes so far up your ass, you're gonna taste leather!"
CARRIE	"Okay, I get it."
CARRIE	Angry women can be scary.
SAMANTHA	Very few women can pull off anger in a tube top.
CARRIE	This night is turning into a total bust.
SAMANTHA	Not total
CARRIE	"Oh, my God, I love you! Where did you get that?"
SAMANTHA	"Apparently, $20 will buy you three drinks a channel change and a joint."
CARRIE	All Right.
SAMANTHA	Fucking men.
CARRIE	Men are bullshit.
SAMANTHA	That's what I'm talking about.
CARRIE	Being someone's girlfriend
CARRIE	No good can come Of it.
SAMANTHA	That's what I'm saying.
CARRIE	Wow! This is strong weed.
SAMANTHA	It's Smith.
SAMANTHA	Hello.
SMITH	Hi.
SMITH	Did you see me?
SAMANTHA	"Yes, we saw it."
SMITH	How'd I do?
SAMANTHA	"Perfect, just like we planned."
SMITH	We're all going to the
SAMANTHA	can You Hear me?
SMITH	Hello?
SAMANTHA	I'm not getting any reception here.
SAMANTHA	Let me
SAMANTHA	Are you there?
CARRIE	"As I contemplated the fact that my relationship had gone to pot, literally I realized no high or low would make this day any day other than the day I got broken up with by a Post-it."
OFFICER	Police.
OFFICER	Stay right where you are.
OFFICER	That's the way it goes.
OFFICER	We have to take her downtown.
IRANDA	"Officer, please."
IRANDA	I am a lawyer and a mother.
IRANDA	This woman is my friend.
IRANDA	She's an extremely law-abiding citizen.
OFFICER	Who just broke the law.
IRANDA	"Yes, but in her defense, she has had a very bad day."
CHARLOTTE	her Boyfriend Just broke up with her.
SAMANTHA	on a Post-it.
OFFICER	"Come on, that didn't happen."
OFFICER	"""I'm sorry."
OFFICER	I can't.
OFFICER	Don't hate me.
OFFICER	""" Wow, brutal."
OFFICER	"Tell you what, I'll write you up for smoking in a bar."
SAMANTHA	"Come on, can't you just let her off?"
OFFICER	I'm sorry.
OFFICER	I can't.
OFFICER	Don't hate me.
CARRIE	Hear that? It's midnight.
CARRIE	The official end to what will now be known as the day I got arrested for smoking a doobie.
CARRIE	I said doobie.
CARRIE	This is great!
IRANDA	You didn't get arrested.
CHARLOTTE	"See, your Post-it was your get-out-of-jail-free card."
CHARLOTTE	"If you never met Berger, you wouldn't"
SAMANTHA	"Stop, you're killing my buzz."
IRANDA	"I have to say, I'm starting to agree with Charlotte's way of thinking."
IRANDA	If I hadn't accidentally gotten pregnant by Steve I never would have had Brady.
IRANDA	I'm not finished.
IRANDA	And had no time to eat.
IRANDA	So I never would have fit into my skinny jeans and realize this city is full of cute men.
SAMANTHA	Now that's my kind of thinking.
SAMANTHA	Don't bogart the split.
CARRIE	"Okay, I know what I learned from my Berger relationship."
CARRIE	"Wait a minute, I just had it."
CARRIE	What?
CHARLOTTE	"You know what, I changed my mind."
IRANDA	You don't think everything happens for a reason?
CHARLOTTE	"No, not about that."
CHARLOTTE	About the wedding.
CHARLOTTE	I really want you guys to be my bridesmaids.
CHARLOTTE	"You don't have to wear the matching dresses, I promise."
CARRIE	Alright!
SAMANTHA	I'll eat to that.
IRANDA	can I get That in writing?
IRANDA	I think I've had enough.
IRANDA	My jeans just popped.
CARRIE	"I might never find a lesson in why Berger and I split but at least, for the moment, there was a banana split."
CARRIE	"My career had reached new heights, literally."
CARRIE	An editor at New York magazine thought I would be the perfect person to write about the ultimate challenge for swingers.
CARRIE	The flying trapeze.
STANFORD	Wouldn't you rather be at Geoffrey?
STANFORD	They're having a sale on stripes!
CARRIE	That's not supportive!
INSTRUCTOR	Step on up.
INSTRUCTOR	Good.
INSTRUCTOR	That's good.
INSTRUCTOR	Come around to my side.
INSTRUCTOR	We'll take off your climbing lines and strap on your safety harness.
CARRIE	Please strap on anything that'll keep me from plummeting to my death.
INSTRUCTOR	Toes over the edge.
INSTRUCTOR	"Feet shoulder-width apart, just a little bit more."
INSTRUCTOR	That's good.
INSTRUCTOR	Head up.
INSTRUCTOR	Now put your right hand out in front of you.
INSTRUCTOR	I've got you.
INSTRUCTOR	Good.
INSTRUCTOR	Are you ready to grab the bar?
CARRIE	I'm ready to go to the bar.
CARRIE	Does everyone say that?
INSTRUCTOR	Pretty much.
INSTRUCTOR	"Okay, hold the bar in one hand."
STANFORD	You're queen of the world.
CARRIE	You're queen of the world.
INSTRUCTOR	All right.
INSTRUCTOR	That's good.
INSTRUCTOR	Keep your head up.
INSTRUCTOR	Don't look down.
INSTRUCTOR	Are you ready?
INSTRUCTOR	And
STANFORD	"Swing out, sister."
CARRIE	"Two hours later, I was hooked."
CARRIE	Are you watching?
CARRIE	I'm about to try a catch.
STANFORD	Maybe you should quit while you're alive.
INSTRUCTOR	You can totally do this.
INSTRUCTOR	Just listen to me and trust me.
INSTRUCTOR	All right.
INSTRUCTOR	Legs up.
INSTRUCTOR	Take your hands off and reach for me.
INSTRUCTOR	This time you got it.
INSTRUCTOR	Let go.
INSTRUCTOR	Let go.
CARRIE	No.
CARRIE	That day I didn't get caught but Samantha's zipper did.
CARRIE	This is one of the frustrating things about living alone.
CARRIE	There's not always somebody around to rip your clothes off.
SAMANTHA	"Hey, Smith, wanna come over and do me?"
CARRIE	"What she meant was ""undo me."""
CARRIE	But two birds with one stone.
CARRIE	And in Central Park a photographer attempted to catch two lovebirds sitting on a stone.
CHARLOTTE	"Honey, a little less teeth."
CHARLOTTE	Just relax your lips.
CHARLOTTE	"No, now you're squinting."
CARRIE	A lesser man might have told Charlotte to take a flying leap but Harry loved her too much.
HARRY 	I thought the point was to look natural.
CHARLOTTE	That's what I'm trying to get you to do.
HARRY 	"One might ask, how natural is it to be sitting in Central Park in a suit?"
CHARLOTTE	I read the wedding section religiously and I know what they're looking for.
CHARLOTTE	Not all pictures are selected.
CHARLOTTE	And I really want there to be a York-Goldenblatt announcement of our wedding in the Sunday Times.
CHARLOTTE	"So, please, just a little less teeth."
HARRY 	"Charlotte York, I cannot wait to marry you."
CHARLOTTE	That's perfect.
CHARLOTTE	That's it.
HARRY 	I was having a moment.
CHARLOTTE	Lipstick!
CHARLOTTE	Wait!
CHARLOTTE	"No, sorry, no kissing pictures."
CHARLOTTE	It's tacky.
CARRIE	And speaking of tacky
STEVE	"Cute, huh?"
STEVE	Debbie bought it for him over at the Sixth Avenue flea market.
IRANDA	Did you wash it first?
STEVE	She also got something for you.
STEVE	It's aromatherapy.
STEVE	"You know, I was thinking, maybe we should figure out a time for the two of you to meet."
IRANDA	What? Why?
STEVE	She's around Brady.
STEVE	I know you're not comfortable with that.
IRANDA	I'm completely comfortable.
IRANDA	I don't need to meet her.
IRANDA	I trust you.
IRANDA	She bought me a fucking candle.
IRANDA	"And it was an aromatherapy candle, for serenity and calm."
IRANDA	I was much more serene and calm before the fucking candle.
SAMANTHA	Women with candles replace women with cats as the new sad thing.
IRANDA	And get this: He thinks I should meet her.
IRANDA	I sense that he wants us to become friends.
CARRIE	Forget it.
CARRIE	You do not need to become friends with the new girlfriend.
CARRIE	"It's unnatural, uncomfortable, insincere and rife with ulterior motive."
IRANDA	has this happened to you?
CARRIE	"No, I'm just being supportive."
CHARLOTTE	But There is a baby involved.
IRANDA	Exactly.
IRANDA	"She's using Brady to get to me, and I am not falling for it."
CARRIE	"Speaking of falling, I tried the trapeze yesterday for that piece that I'm writing."
CHARLOTTE	I could never!
CHARLOTTE	I have the most terrible fear of heights.
CARRIE	I do not.
CARRIE	You've seen my shoes.
IRANDA	So did you fly through the air with the greatest of ease?
CARRIE	"At first, but then I couldn't do a catch."
CARRIE	"I had to let go and reach for the guy, who was very cute, and I still couldn't do it."
SAMANTHA	You are insane for getting into a harness without even a hope of an orgasm.
HARRY 	"Hello, ladies."
CHARLOTTE	"Hi, honey."
CARRIE	"Hey, Harry."
CHARLOTTE	"Hi, Howie."
CHARLOTTE	"Everyone, this is Harry's best friend Howie Halberstein, in from Portland."
HARRY 	We're not crashing.
HARRY 	I'm just here to drop off the photo proofs and the seating chart.
HARRY 	"We're gonna have a quick bite to eat, then I'm taking the place cards to the calligrapher."
HOWIE HALBERSTEIN	"After that, we're gonna go around the corner and try to find our balls."
HOWIE HALBERSTEIN	"Yes, Harry knows how to show a guy a good time."
HARRY 	"Howie, this is Samantha and Miranda and Carrie."
HOWIE HALBERSTEIN	Hi.
CARRIE	"Hi, how are you?"
HOWIE HALBERSTEIN	Good.
CARRIE	Good.
HARRY 	Good guy.
HARRY 	"You two, I see it happening."
HARRY 	"So, Carrie, I was thinking maybe you might show Howie around a little later."
HOWIE HALBERSTEIN	Unless Harry needs me to ice a cake or something.
CARRIE	I'm kind of busy because I have to do a flying trapeze thing.
HOWIE	That is so weird.
HOWIE	"I have a lion-taming thing tomorrow, so that's out for me."
HOWIE	"But, you know, if you change your mind, I'll give you my business card."
HOWIE	There You go.
CARRIE	Thank you.
HOWIE	All my lines are on there.
HOWIE	"Call me, I'll be waiting by the phone."
CHARLOTTE	What's wrong with you?
IRANDA	he was funny and cute.
CARRIE	"Yeah, and in town for a week."
CARRIE	What's the point?
SAMANTHA	That is the point.
SAMANTHA	"It's the best possible scenario, because you know he's leaving."
CARRIE	"But it's like whatever happens, there's an expiration date."
CARRIE	It's expiration dating.
SAMANTHA	It isn't dating.
SAMANTHA	It's sex.
SAMANTHA	It's fun.
SAMANTHA	It's a fling.
CARRIE	"Please, I'm too old for a fling."
CARRIE	I can barely do a swing.
CARRIE	"If you'll excuse me, I have to go home so I can write about the fact that I couldn't do a catch."
CHARLOTTE	he is a catch.
SAMANTHA	You should do him.
CARRIE	"When you're young, your whole life is about the pursuit of fun."
CARRIE	Then you grow up and learn to be cautious.
CARRIE	You could break a bone or a heart.
CARRIE	"You look before you leap, and sometimes you don't leap at all because there's not always someone there to catch you."
CARRIE	And in life there's no safety net.
CARRIE	When did it stop being fun and start being scary?
CARRIE	I decided it was time to leave fear behind and have some fun.
INSTRUCTOR	"Okay, legs up."
INSTRUCTOR	That's good.
INSTRUCTOR	Let go and reach for me.
CARRIE	I can't.
INSTRUCTOR	"All right, this time."
INSTRUCTOR	Let go.
CARRIE	I can't.
ANTHONY	Don't tell me you can't.
ANTHONY	I want nothing but lilies on the chuppah.
ANTHONY	The theme is Yentl Chic.
CHARLOTTE	Don't forget the candles.
ANTHONY	This isn't the first wedding I've planned.
ANTHONY	"Jesus Christ, you're worse than me!"
ANTHONY	"We want candles, candles, candles."
ANTHONY	"And I don't want short, stubby, broken-up dick candles."
ANTHONY	I want long tapers.
ANTHONY	"All Right, call me Right back."
CHARLOTTE	Ta-da!
CHARLOTTE	It's okay?
ANTHONY	Okay? You're Audrey Hepburnowitz!
CHARLOTTE	I'm so excited about this wedding.
CHARLOTTE	We're doing everything according to tradition.
CHARLOTTE	"We're going to smash the glass, and the signing of the ketubah."
CHARLOTTE	The hora.
ANTHONY	Be careful.
ANTHONY	God forbid you fall off the chair.
ANTHONY	"Oh, the horror! The horror!"
CHARLOTTE	Maybe we won't do the chair thing.
ANTHONY	You have to.
ANTHONY	That's the big finish.
ANTHONY	"Remember, when you're up there, pretend you're having a good time hang on for dear life, and for fuck's sake keep your legs together."
ANTHONY	Nobody wants to see the bride's beaver.
CHARLOTTE	Don't say that in front of my dress.
ANTHONY	Hello.
ANTHONY	York residence.
ANTHONY	"Yes, we have a minute."
ANTHONY	It's The New York Times fact checker.
ANTHONY	"Yes, Goldenblatt has two ""T""s."
ANTHONY	Sure.
ANTHONY	Fax it over!
CHARLOTTE	"We're in, we're in!"
ANTHONY	This calls for a hora! Hey!
CHARLOTTE	"Oh, my God! What're you doing here? Don't look at me!"
ANTHONY	"Jesus Christ, Char, my ear."
CHARLOTTE	You're not supposed to see me in my dress.
CHARLOTTE	"This is bad luck, very bad luck! Close your eyes."
CHARLOTTE	"Keep them closed! Oh, no, this is so bad."
HARRY 	Are all brides like that?
ANTHONY	That's nothing.
ANTHONY	I once had a girl in Long Island give herself a stroke.
ANTHONY	"She pulled it together for the big day, though."
SMITH	Hopefully I'll get cell reception down in Mexico.
CARRIE	"Samantha, a fan of expiration dating was about to enjoy one of the benefits of dating an actor."
CARRIE	"Location, location, location."
SMITH	It's gonna be cool working with Gus Van Sant.
SMITH	Here.
SMITH	Let me.
SMITH	I can't believe we don't get to spend my last night together.
SAMANTHA	are You dying?
SMITH	no.
SAMANTHA	Then it's not your last night.
SMITH	There.
SMITH	"I'm gonna miss you, Samantha."
SAMANTHA	Save that performance for Mr. Van Sant.
SAMANTHA	It's just two weeks.
SMITH	It's a long time.
SAMANTHA	Would you get out of here already? I'm late as it is.
SMITH	"Yeah, yeah."
SAMANTHA	"And listen, when you're on location don't do anything I wouldn't do."
SMITH	What Does That rule out?
SAMANTHA	There are things.
SAMANTHA	Karaoke.
SAMANTHA	I don't do that.
IRANDA	(sings to baby)
STEVE	this is it.
DEBBIE	It's a very nice building.
STEVE	Miranda! I can't find my keys.
IRANDA	Magda!
DEBBIE	You Still have keys?
IRANDA	I'm not home.
STEVE	because Of Brady.
IRANDA	Do you understand?
IRANDA	I'm already at Charlotte's.
IRANDA	I am not home.
STEVE	is Miranda here?
AGDA	she is not home.
DEBBIE	That's too bad.
DEBBIE	I was really looking forward to meeting her.
AGDA	She is not home.
STEVE	"Magda, this is Debbie."
DEBBIE	Nice to meet you.
STEVE	"All right, we just need to grab some things out of Brady's crib."
STEVE	"The last time I forgot Mr. Elephant, Brady acted like a big baby."
STEVE	"Didn't you, B-Boy?"
DEBBIE	He is a big baby.
AGDA	But I have not cleaned in room yet.
STEVE	That's okay.
DEBBIE	This is a nice room.
DEBBIE	She has nice taste.
STEVE	Yeah.
STEVE	I helped build the crib.
DEBBIE	"Really? What's wrong, Brady? Did you drop your Binky? Where's your Binky?"
STEVE	It's right there.
DEBBIE	"Here you go, Bradylicious."
DEBBIE	"Hey, wanna go to Blockbuster and rent a tape or something?"
STEVE	"Okay, but this time I get to pick."
DEBBIE	Bye.
STEVE	"Bye, Magda."
IRANDA	There's a lot of dust down there.
IRANDA	You really should vacuum under
CARRIE	That night we all gathered at Charlotte's casual rehearsal dinner.
CARRIE	You're like a lint tray.
CARRIE	What's happening back here?
IRANDA	That Debbie is crazy.
IRANDA	She came to my apartment with Steve and totally ambushed me.
IRANDA	I had to hide under the bed to avoid them.
CARRIE	Seriously?
IRANDA	Maybe.
CARRIE	did You see her?
IRANDA	Just her Shoes and her nails.
CARRIE	And?
IRANDA	both acrylic.
CARRIE	Maybe you should just meet her and get it over with.
IRANDA	I don't want to meet her.
IRANDA	"If I meet her, she's real, and that means Steve has an actual girlfriend."
CARRIE	Apparently I wasn't the only one who had trouble letting go.
CARRIE	Hey.
CARRIE	What's happening there?
SAMANTHA	"Oh, you know."
SAMANTHA	"Bride, bride, bride."
SAMANTHA	"Blah, blah, blah."
SAMANTHA	I just saw your fling go into the bathroom.
SAMANTHA	It's like shooting fish in a barrel.
CARRIE	Still no.
SAMANTHA	It's just casual sex.
CARRIE	Nothing's casual anymore.
CARRIE	Not even when it says so on the invitation.
IRANDA	Just go in there and see what happens.
IRANDA	"Worst comes to worst, you could always hide under the bed."
CARRIE	I decided they were right.
CARRIE	It was time to get back in the swing of things.
HOWIE	good to see you.
AN	see You later.
CARRIE	"Hey, how are you?"
HOWIE	"Wow, this is kind of uncomfortable."
HOWIE	"Look, would you please stop calling me?"
HOWIE	I don't have time to chat.
HOWIE	I've got boutonnieres on my mind.
CARRIE	I'm sorry I never called.
HOWIE	"No, I understand, you're busy."
HOWIE	That time of year.
HOWIE	Final exams for Clown College or something.
CARRIE	"What would that entail, you think?"
HOWIE	"The seating arrangements in the little car, walking in the floppy shoes"
CARRIE	Squirting flower and nose application.
HOWIE	"continual pieing, the cloud-kissing"
CARRIE	Maybe I would have a fling.
CARRIE	"After all, how bad could it be?"
CARRIE	That night Howie and I had sex like we were teenagers again.
CARRIE	"Meaning he had no idea what he was doing, and I didn't say anything."
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, Samantha was banging around as well."
ANSWERING MACHINE	You have one new message.
SMITH	"Hey, I'm here."
SMITH	It's pretty cool.
SMITH	You miss me yet?
CARRIE	That's the thing about getting used to a man.
CARRIE	There's always a catch.
CHARLOTTE	It's here!
CARRIE	"Not just her wedding day, but The New York Times."
CHARLOTTE	"Oh, my God!"
CHARLOTTE	I have a moustache.
HARRY 	It's an ink stain.
HARRY 	But look at me.
HARRY 	"Now, that is a terrific smile."
CHARLOTTE	This is a nightmare!
HARRY 	It's probably just our paper.
HARRY 	"Anyway, who cares?"
HARRY 	We're getting married today!
CHARLOTTE	I look like Hitler!
CHARLOTTE	I'm having a Jewish wedding and I look like Hitler!
CARRIE	Hello?
CHARLOTTE	In your paper do I have a moustache?
CARRIE	What?
CHARLOTTE	"In your wedding section, does it look like I have a moustache?"
CARRIE	Hang on a minute.
CARRIE	"As I feared, my fling had become a pain in the neck."
HARRY 	You do not look like Hitler.
HARRY 	"Frito Bandito, maybe."
CHARLOTTE	The bad luck is starting already.
CARRIE	Yeah.
CARRIE	There's a little something but maybe it's just my paper.
CARRIE	And your paper.
CHARLOTTE	I have to go.
CARRIE	"Clearly, Charlotte was bent out of shape, and so was I."
STANFORD	"Come on, granny."
STANFORD	I'll take you to the Early Bird Special.
CARRIE	"Oh, God, don't make me laugh."
CARRIE	It hurts.
STANFORD	Is this still from your days as a Flying Wallenda?
CARRIE	"That's my official story, and it's partially true."
CARRIE	But this is a sex-sprain.
STANFORD	good for you.
CARRIE	"No, It was not good for me."
CARRIE	It was jackrabbit sex.
CARRIE	"You know, pound, pound"
STANFORD	are straight men Still allowed to do that?
CARRIE	"No, they aren't."
CARRIE	It's bad.
CARRIE	It's basically masturbating with a woman instead of your hand.
CARRIE	I don't enjoy it.
HOWIE	"Carrie, you made it!"
CARRIE	Hi.
STANFORD	The jackrabbit?
CARRIE	I better
STANFORD	Hop to it.
HOWIE	You look hot!
CARRIE	Thanks.
HOWIE	Guess what?
CARRIE	what?
HOWIE	I got a suite at The Mercer for later.
HOWIE	King-size bed.
HOWIE	Huge tub.
HOWIE	"We can have breakfast before I leave unless, of course, we're busy doing something else."
CARRIE	I don't know.
CARRIE	I'm pretty tired from last night.
HOWIE	"I'm only gonna be in town for another day, and I want to get to know you better."
CARRIE	"Okay, we'll see."
HOWIE	"We'll see? I know what ""we'll see"" means."
HOWIE	"It means ""see you."""
CARRIE	No.
CARRIE	"No, the thing is you're just visiting, so I figured it was a one-night kind of thing."
CARRIE	Just fun.
HOWIE	"If I'd known you were just using me, I wouldn't have made love to you like that."
RABBI MINSCH	We are here today to celebrate the union of two very special people: Harry and Charlotte York.
RABBI MINSCH	It's important for everyone here to be a witness to this moment for the Jewish wedding ceremony has two parts.
RABBI MINSCH	"The first designates to the community that the kallah, bride and the chatan, groom are for one another alone."
RABBI MINSCH	And the second part gives them to one another.
RABBI MINSCH	It's a gift and a huge responsibility.
CARRIE	As one man slipped a ring on one woman was still trying to slip a bracelet off.
CARRIE	Sorry.
CARRIE	It's a back spasm.
CARRIE	I'm sorry.
CARRIE	It seemed to Charlotte that the wedding had gone from Jewish law to Murphy's Law.
ANTHONY	Mazel tov.
CARRIE	"Charlotte, are you okay?"
CHARLOTTE	This is a disaster.
CHARLOTTE	It's the worst wedding in history.
CARRIE	That's not true.
CARRIE	Although I only saw most of it from here down.
CHARLOTTE	Harry never should've walked in on me wearing my wedding dress.
CHARLOTTE	Now we're cursed.
CARRIE	You're not cursed.
CARRIE	You're married.
CARRIE	You just got married.
CHARLOTTE	I know but I wanted everything to be perfect.
CHARLOTTE	"Okay, you have to stop with the tears."
CARRIE	"You already had the perfect wedding and the marriage, not so perfect."
CARRIE	I think this is a good sign.
CARRIE	"I think the worse the wedding, the better the marriage."
CHARLOTTE	I have a stain on my dress.
CARRIE	That's good! That's a good sign!
CHARLOTTE	You're just trying to make me feel better.
CARRIE	"No, I'm trying to get you to open your eyes, because you're missing it."
CHARLOTTE	what?
CARRIE	Everything! You're missing your wedding.
CARRIE	You have a wonderful man who loves you who'll be there to catch you when you fall.
CARRIE	Do you know how special that is?
CARRIE	I would love to find a man who's strong enough to catch me.
CARRIE	"So let's get to that reception, so you can fall on a cake or something."
CHARLOTTE	Okay.
CARRIE	okay?
CARRIE	"perfect Still, Of course."
CARRIE	"Oh, Christ!"
CARRIE	Are you okay?
SAMANTHA	Yeah.
SAMANTHA	I'm just feeling a little sad.
SAMANTHA	It was just so beautiful.
CARRIE	the ceremony?
SAMANTHA	my bracelet.
HOWIE	"Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention, please?"
IRANDA	"God, it's time for the toast."
IRANDA	"Top me off, I'm next."
HOWIE	I would like to raise a glass to Harry and Charlotte because they found each other despite all the bullshit.
HOWIE	It's tough out there.
HOWIE	"I mean, people don't care like they used to."
HOWIE	People leave you hanging.
HOWIE	People are a bitch.
STANFORD	Is this a toast or a roast?
HOWIE	So here's to love! And love means never ever having to say.
HOWIE	"""You used me for sex!"""
HARRY 	"Thanks, Howie."
HARRY 	That's nice.
HOWIE	Mazel tov.
CARRIE	It was a Mazel Tov cocktail.
CHARLOTTE	"Carrie said, ""The worse the wedding, the better the marriage."""
HARRY 	Then I think Howie just got us to our Silver.
IRANDA	Hi.
IRANDA	Hello.
IRANDA	Great.
IRANDA	"I would like to congratulate my very brave friend, Charlotte who knows what she wants and who goes for it."
IRANDA	Not everyone can do that.
IRANDA	Especially when it comes to love some of us can't even say the words.
IRANDA	But
ANTHONY	"Sorry, hon."
ANTHONY	"Good speech, though."
CHARLOTTE	Maybe Miranda just got us to our Gold.
STANFORD	He's certainly acrobatic.
CARRIE	"Oh, yeah."
CARRIE	He's the regular Jerk du Soleil.
CARRIE	Do you think everyone knows I slept with him?
STANFORD	Yes.
STANFORD	And they all think you're a big whore-ah.
CHARLOTTE	I don't like this.
CHARLOTTE	I'm afraid!
HARRY 	Of what? What's the worst that can happen?
HARRY 	We'll live happily ever after?
CARRIE	"And, of course, this being a wedding, there was one more catch to go."
CHARLOTTE	Okay!
CHARLOTTE	Who's ready to catch the bouquet?
IRANDA	Not me.
IRANDA	I've lit myself on fire.
IRANDA	I've showed emotion in public.
IRANDA	I think I'm done.
CARRIE	"Oh, You were Fabulous."
IRANDA	I believe You mean flammable.
CARRIE	"Okay, now you're done."
CARRIE	It wasn't a perfect catch and neither was mine.
CARRIE	But I survived because I have a good safety net.
CARRIE	The single New Yorker's weekend is all about buying.
CARRIE	"The latest Vogue, fresh flowers and gifts for previously-single New Yorkers."
CARRIE	Hi.
CARRIE	I'm here for the Welker wedding registry.
CARRIE	I'll take the Newport soup ladle and three Bimini steak knives.
CARRIE	The baby Peck list?
CARRIE	The burpy blanket.
CARRIE	"Okay, what is left?"
CARRIE	"Fine, I'll take four espresso cups and a pepper grinder."
CARRIE	"Yeah, okay, the Little Me activity chair."
CARRIE	"That night, Stanford and I were invited to celebrate the arrival of baby boy Bronson latest son of Kyra and Chuck."
STANFORD	"easy, baby girl."
CARRIE	Sorry.
CARRIE	"Hey, what you got in there, Stanny?"
STANFORD	The Peter Rabbit dish set with matching bib.
STANFORD	"Dang, you snagged that!"
CARRIE	"Thanks to you, I was left with the Little Me chair."
STANFORD	And get this.
STANFORD	I also got him a CD of Free to Be You and Me I loved Marlo Thomas!
CARRIE	I played that album all through the fifth grade.
CARRIE	I wanted to run as fast as the wind.
STANFORD	I played William Wants A Doll so many times I almost turned my little sister into a gay man.
ARGO	Welcome to the party.
ARGO	"I'm Margo, Kyra's sister."
ARGO	"The gifts go over on the table, and the shoes go there."
ARGO	Kyra and Chuck don't like outside dirt coming in.
ARGO	The twins are always picking things up off the floor.
CARRIE	But this is an outfit.
ARGO	They'd really appreciate it.
STANFORD	Good thing I wore my party socks.
CARRIE	"Jeez, if I'd known I was gonna be shoeless I would have compensated with a big hat or something."
CARRIE	Okay.
CARRIE	"Well, now I'm so teeny I might bump my head on the coffee table."
STANFORD	"Watch out, Little Me."
CARRIE	"Our hostess, Kyra Bronson, had made a name for herself in the early '90s taking pictures of anorexic actresses on beds at the Chelsea Hotel."
KYRA BRONSON	"Hey, you two."
CARRIE	Now she took pictures of fat babies in buckets.
CARRIE	"We come from the East 70s, bearing gifts."
CARRIE	Where is the blessed child?
KYRA BRONSON	The baby's in his room.
KYRA BRONSON	You can't miss him.
KYRA BRONSON	"He looks just like Chuck except without that sad, closed-up hole in his ear when he pierced it in the '80s."
KYRA BRONSON	"Anyway, here."
CARRIE	Thank you.
KYRA BRONSON	I've gotta go.
KYRA BRONSON	"Other people need drinks, and by ""others,"" I mean me."
KYRA BRONSON	"Hey, Milo, Allegra!"
STANFORD	"Waiter, there's a baby in my drink."
CARRIE	"Uptown, Miranda was putting her foot down in her co-op board meeting."
IRANDA	"Look, we all want to find the perfect tenant for $10,000."
IRANDA	All I'm asking is that we not prolong the interview.
IRANDA	"Whatever decision we make about Robert, let's make it quick."
IRANDA	I've got a baby downstairs getting over the chicken pox.
CATARACT LADY	I have a cataract.
BOARD PRESIDENT	Hello.
BOARD PRESIDENT	"Come in, won't you?"
ROBERT	Hi.
BOARD PRESIDENT	"Yes, hi."
CARRIE	"And suddenly, Miranda wasn't so bored at her board meeting."
IRANDA	"Hi, I'm Miranda Hobbes."
ROBERT	Hi.
IRANDA	And this is everybody else.
ROBERT	"And I'm Robert, but you probably know that already along with my social security number and my jacket size."
IRANDA	"So, Robert, you're a doctor for the Knicks?"
ROBERT	"Yeah, guilty as charged."
BOARD PRESIDENT	how long have You had That
IRANDA	"Hey, you've had a great season."
ROBERT	I take it you're not a basketball fan.
IRANDA	"Well, you've got me there."
IRANDA	I'm a baseball person.
ROBERT	Yankees Or Mets?
IRANDA	"Please, Yankees."
ROBERT	should have known.
IRANDA	and What is That supposed to mean?
BOARD PRESIDENT	On Page 4 of your tax return
IRANDA	"Lynn, please."
IRANDA	We'll get to it.
CARRIE	While Miranda was playing a game of pick-up
HARRY 	"You tell him I'll do depositions Friday, but only if my client is ready."
CARRIE	Charlotte was picking up as well.
HARRY 	Exactly.
HARRY 	"What, you gonna push me on this?"
HARRY 	"Don't push me! Because if you push me, then I push back."
HARRY 	I don't have to produce my client for this
CARRIE	"Charlotte knew when Harry moved in, he would unpack his bags."
CARRIE	She wasn't expecting the teabags.
HARRY 	And everything else?
HARRY 	Why are you hocking me on this?
HARRY 	Can you not hear what I'm saying to you? I'll repeat this slowly.
HARRY 	"Open your ears, ready, cause here it comes."
HARRY 	I don't think so! Clear?
CARRIE	One tax return and a half hour of eyelash-batting later
IRANDA	It was really Nice to meet you.
ROBERT	"You, too."
IRANDA	And I won't hold that Mets thing against you.
ROBERT	I appreciate that.
IRANDA	"Well, he's perfect!"
BOARD PRESIDENT	"Frankly, I am concerned about his financials."
BOARD PRESIDENT	His alimony payments are awfully high.
BOARD MEMBER	And he's never owned before.
IRANDA	You people are crazy.
CATARACT LADY	It's the single ones who always throw the wild parties with all the girls.
IRANDA	"Okay, I think we all know what's not being said here."
CARRIE	The unspoken thing was that Robert was cute and Miranda was horny.
KYRA	"And then we saw the most amazing house I swear, I had no idea who we were bidding against."
CARRIE	You liar.
CARRIE	You two know everything.
KYRA	That's true.
KYRA	We got the house but we could not get a table at Nick & Tony's for the rest of the summer.
STANFORD	"Well, it's getting late."
KYRA	"Oh, my! We have held you guys captive."
CARRIE	"No, we've had a swell time."
CARRIE	"It's just It's midnight, he's gay."
CARRIE	He has to start his night.
CARRIE	"Anyway, congrats on the baby."
KYRA	Thanks.
STANFORD	"Yeah, he's just precious."
CARRIE	"Okay, Bye."
KYRA	Bye.
CHUCK BRONSON	Nice to meet you.
KYRA	"Then, of course, our landscaper takes off with half of our trees."
CARRIE	"We might have been one foot out the door, but my shoes appeared to have already left."
CHUCK BRONSON	"Then they told us, ""That's what you get for stealing Billy Joel's firewood."""
CARRIE	was There another Room for the shoes?
KYRA	no.
CARRIE	Mine seem to have gone missing.
CHUCK BRONSON	That's crazy.
KYRA	"God, Carrie, I'm sorry."
KYRA	I just can't imagine where your shoes went.
KYRA	"You know, Jennifer was wearing sandals."
KYRA	Perhaps she took yours by mistake.
CARRIE	"Actually, they weren't sandals."
CARRIE	They were Manolos.
KYRA	I'm sure they'll turn up.
KYRA	I can loan you some shoes to go home in.
CARRIE	They say you shouldn't judge until you've walked a mile in someone else's shoes.
CARRIE	I made it six blocks.
CARRIE	"The next day, over dessert I was still not over the fact that my shoes had deserted me."
CARRIE	These were new Manolos.
CARRIE	I hadn't even done a full lap around the party.
CARRIE	I don't play favorites with my shoes but these were very special.
CHARLOTTE	Who would steal shoes from a party?
CARRIE	Someone size 7 with excellent taste.
SAMANTHA	Why in hell did you take your shoes off to begin with?
CARRIE	We had to for their kids.
CARRIE	Apparently we drag things in on our heels that make children sick.
IRANDA	"Please, it's children who drag the germs around."
IRANDA	Brady got the chicken pox courtesy of some kid who licked him at the playground.
SAMANTHA	"Oh, my God!"
CHARLOTTE	Kyra must have been mortified.
CARRIE	"Actually, I kept waiting for the mortification that never came."
CARRIE	She said they might turn up and sent me home.
SAMANTHA	Those shoes are not turning up anywhere but a pawn shop in Brooklyn.
CARRIE	Stop.
CARRIE	I'm gonna cry in my flan.
CARRIE	So that's it? They're just gone? Boo-hoo?
IRANDA	"Legally, she owes You for them."
CARRIE	I can't ask her to pay for my shoes.
SAMANTHA	"Why not? If you gave a party and told her to leave her baby outside in the hall and her baby was missing at the end of the night, believe me, there'd be payback."
CHARLOTTE	That is the craziest thing I've ever heard!
CHARLOTTE	Children are not shoes.
CARRIE	I know.
CARRIE	I'm not saying it.
SAMANTHA	You have every right to be upset about your shoes.
SAMANTHA	I am so sick of these people with their children.
SAMANTHA	"I'm telling you, they're everywhere."
SAMANTHA	"Sitting next to me in first class, eating at the next table at John Look at that."
SAMANTHA	"This place is for double cappuccinos, not double strollers."
SAMANTHA	I'm sorry.
IRANDA	"Hey, no need to apologize."
IRANDA	I wouldn't bring Brady here.
IRANDA	Mommy needs two hands to eat her $8 cake.
CHARLOTTE	You're not gonna defend children?
IRANDA	"No, I don't like any children but my own."
IRANDA	Look at that dirty little rugrat.
CHARLOTTE	That's just chocolate.
CHARLOTTE	"All children are beautiful, but not as beautiful as Brady."
IRANDA	That's true.
CARRIE	"Hey, so how goes the big matrimonial move-in?"
CHARLOTTE	Good.
CHARLOTTE	Harry's moved most of his stuff in.
CHARLOTTE	It's going well.
CHARLOTTE	"And I'm just trying to learn to compromise, because sometimes I can be a little rigid."
IRANDA	That's not true.
CHARLOTTE	"There's just one thing and it's small, but it really grosses me out."
CHARLOTTE	We have a teabag situation.
SAMANTHA	I understand.
SAMANTHA	Just breathe through your nose.
SAMANTHA	When you're sucking his balls.
CHARLOTTE	
SAMANTHA	"I thought you meant ""tea bagging,"" when you hold a guy's balls in your mouth."
IRANDA	"Why is it called Oh, I get it! Because they hang, and the dipping."
CARRIE	"Oh, great."
CARRIE	Now I've lost my shoes and my appetite.
SAMANTHA	This is very good.
HARRY 	"You now what I love about living with you, besides those nutty soaps in the bathroom?"
CHARLOTTE	what?
HARRY 	Living with you.
CHARLOTTE	Honey I need to talk to you.
HARRY 	"What's up, baby?"
CHARLOTTE	"I really don't mean to be a nag, but it's just, well It's this."
HARRY 	tea?
CHARLOTTE	"No, teabags."
CHARLOTTE	"You leave them all over the house, and they stain."
CHARLOTTE	Maybe you could just try to be a little more careful.
HARRY 	
CHARLOTTE	What do You mean?
HARRY 	"I've been really trying to watch my ass, now that I'm living in your house."
CHARLOTTE	It's our house now.
CHARLOTTE	I want you to be yourself.
HARRY 	"Yeah, well, myself is pretty much a bull in a china shop."
CHARLOTTE	Then you're a bull in our china shop.
HARRY 	It's a bull.
CHARLOTTE	I get it.
HARRY 	Just Making Sure.
ROBERT	Hold it.
ROBERT	"Hey, Yankee."
IRANDA	Welcome to the building.
ROBERT	I have a feeling you had a little something to do with that.
IRANDA	Let's just say you owe me bigtime.
ROBERT	You have a pock.
IRANDA	What?
ROBERT	"on your face, Right there."
IRANDA	
ROBERT	"Oh, I thought You were single."
IRANDA	I am.
CARRIE	It was the perfect first conversation.
CARRIE	Minus the pock.
ROBERT	"All right, give me the lotion and cotton balls."
ROBERT	Stat.
IRANDA	"You don't really say ""stat""?"
ROBERT	"No, but it sounds good, doesn't it?"
ROBERT	So this is the little germ-disseminator.
IRANDA	Also known as Brady.
IRANDA	Run while you're still breathing.
ROBERT	"No, it's okay."
ROBERT	I had the chicken pox when I was four.
ROBERT	"Hey, where are you going?"
ROBERT	He's a winner.
ROBERT	I really want one of these some day.
ROBERT	He looks just like you.
IRANDA	You think?
ROBERT	"Oh, Yeah."
ROBERT	"Okay, Mama."
IRANDA	"You know, I Could do this myself."
ROBERT	"Yeah, but I'm a professional."
IRANDA	"Magda, this is Robert."
IRANDA	He's moving in upstairs.
ROBERT	Hi.
AGDA	Nice to meet you.
AGDA	I'll take baby from there.
IRANDA	Okay.
ROBERT	You got another one.
ROBERT	"Okay, Miss Hobbes, I think you'll live."
ROBERT	But no scratching.
ROBERT	Doctor's orders.
IRANDA	Okey-doke.
CARRIE	"For Miranda, Robert was just what the doctor ordered."
KYRA	"Hey, Carrie, what a surprise."
CARRIE	I was in the neighborhood.
CARRIE	I thought you might want these back.
KYRA	You didn't have to return these.
KYRA	I had forgotten all about them.
CARRIE	Any news on my shoes?
KYRA	no.
KYRA	It's weird.
CARRIE	"So, this Jennifer"
CARRIE	Did you ever find her sandals?
KYRA	What?
CARRIE	"Well, if she took my shoes, she would have left her sandals."
CARRIE	Just being a bit of a shoe detective here.
KYRA	I haven't heard from her.
KYRA	"Oh, my gosh, Carrie, I am such a shit!"
KYRA	I should have offered to pay you for them.
CARRIE	"No, you don't have to do that."
KYRA	"You know, you have kids and you lose all sense of social decency."
KYRA	come in.
CARRIE	Okay.
KYRA	"Milo, honey, put your trucks back for Mommy."
KYRA	So how much were they?
CARRIE	485
KYRA	"Come on, Carrie."
KYRA	That's insane.
CARRIE	"Well, that's what they cost."
KYRA	I'll give you $200.
CARRIE	"Okay, this is an awkward conversation."
KYRA	I'm sorry.
KYRA	I just think that's crazy to spend that much on shoes.
CARRIE	You know how much Manolos are.
CARRIE	You used to wear Manolos.
KYRA	"Sure, before I had a real life."
KYRA	"But Chuck and I have responsibilities now: Kids, houses $485, wow!"
CARRIE	I have a real life.
KYRA	"No offense, but I don't think we should have to pay for your extravagant lifestyle."
KYRA	"I mean, it was your choice to buy shoes that expensive."
CARRIE	"Yes, but it wasn't my choice to take them off."
KYRA	They're just shoes.
ALLEGRA 	Shoes.
CARRIE	She shoe-shamed me.
CARRIE	I left there covered in shame.
IRANDA	She's a fucking bitch!
CARRIE	"But she isn't, that's the thing."
CARRIE	She's become this whole other person.
CARRIE	It's like she's had two caesarians and a lobotomy.
IRANDA	She owes you for those shoes.
CARRIE	"No, it's not about the money."
CARRIE	I don't care about that.
CARRIE	I'm talking about a woman's right to shoes.
CARRIE	Why did she have to shame me?
IRANDA	Because she's trapped in a hell of her own making.
IRANDA	"No, wait, that's me."
IRANDA	I am dying to scratch these!
IRANDA	"But if I do, it'll be worse."
CARRIE	How are they today?
IRANDA	Biblical.
IRANDA	There's literally a pox on my house.
IRANDA	If there wasn't a Jules & Mimi marathon on BBC America this weekend I'd have jumped out the window.
CARRIE	"Hey, speaking of handsome black men, have you spotted any more of Dr. Knicks?"
IRANDA	"Don't say ""spot."""
IRANDA	No.
IRANDA	"As a leper, I'm laying low."
IRANDA	"But according to my sources, he's officially in the building."
CARRIE	Is it bad that my life is filled with shoes and not children?
IRANDA	Stop it! And she is a fucking bitch for making you feel this way.
IRANDA	"Oh, God!"
CARRIE	When we were young Marlo Thomas sang to us about accepting each other and our differences.
CARRIE	But then we got older and started singing a different tune.
CARRIE	We stopped celebrating each other's life choices and started qualifying them.
CARRIE	Is acceptance really such a childish concept?
CARRIE	Or did we have it right all along?
CARRIE	When did we stop being free to be you and me?
CARRIE	"The next morning, Charlotte learned just how free the real Harry could be."
HARRY 	"Oh the shark has pretty teeth, dear"
HARRY 	And he shows them pearly white
HARRY 	morning.
CHARLOTTE	Hi.
CHARLOTTE	are You gonna take a shower?
HARRY 	in a little while.
CARRIE	"Apparently, it took next to nothing to make Harry feel comfortable."
CARRIE	Charlotte felt completely trapped.
CARRIE	She wanted to see Harry be himself in her home.
CARRIE	She just didn't need to see that much of him.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, I decided to bare all to Kyra."
KYRA	Hello.
CARRIE	"Hey, Kyra, it's Carrie."
CARRIE	Listen I feel weird about what happened the other day.
CARRIE	We've been friends a really long time and I just want to clear the air.
KYRA	"Oh, my God, Carrie, I'd forgotten about that days ago."
CARRIE	"Well, I didn't."
CARRIE	"I've been thinking a lot about it, and"
KYRA	"Man, you must have a lot of time on your hands."
KYRA	Milo! Pants stay on.
KYRA	I'm serious! Penises stay in the bathroom.
KYRA	"Carrie, can you hold on for one second? I'll be right back."
KYRA	Thanks.
ALLEGRA 	Hello.
ALLEGRA 	"Hello, Santa."
CARRIE	"You know what, I am Santa."
CARRIE	"I did a little mental addition and over the years, I have bought Kyra an engagement gift, a wedding gift."
CARRIE	"Then there was the trip to Maine for the wedding, three baby gifts."
CARRIE	"In toto, I have spent over $2,300 celebrating her choices."
CARRIE	"And she is shaming me for spending a lousy $485 on myself? Yes, I did the math."
CHARLOTTE	But those were gifts.
CHARLOTTE	"I mean, if you got married or had a child, she'd spend the same on you."
CARRIE	"And if I don't ever get married or have a baby, what? I get bupkis? Think about it."
CARRIE	"If you are single, after graduation there isn't one occasion where people celebrate you."
CHARLOTTE	we have birthdays.
CARRIE	"No, we All have birthdays."
CARRIE	That's a wash.
CARRIE	I am talking about the single gal.
CARRIE	Hallmark doesn't make a congratulations-you-didn't-marry the-wrong-guy card.
CARRIE	And where's the flatware for going on vacation alone?
CHARLOTTE	You're right! Why should I get wedding gifts?
CHARLOTTE	Finding Harry was gift enough.
CARRIE	"No, no."
CARRIE	I'm thrilled to give you gifts to celebrate your life.
CARRIE	I just think it stinks that single people are left out of it.
CARRIE	"So the moral of the story appears to be: Until I get married, I won't be seeing nothing from Kyra."
CARRIE	How's the pistachio?
CHARLOTTE	It's so good.
CHARLOTTE	You want some?
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, Samantha was trying to have a working lunch."
OTHER	Another bite?
SAMANTHA	We got cut off.
SAMANTHA	"Look, I need to get him three VIP seats and"
OTHER	Look at you! Look at you eating your pesto.
SAMANTHA	"No, I don't want any shitty house seats."
SAMANTHA	Listen to me.
SAMANTHA	"No, I can't have any"
WAITER	Excuse me.
WAITER	We don't allow cell phones.
SAMANTHA	are You kidding me?
WAITER	no.
SAMANTHA	I'll call you back.
SAMANTHA	I understand that my cell phone may be annoying to some but what are you doing about that noise?
WAITER	There's nothing we can do about that.
WAITER	That's a child.
CARRIE	And that was all Samantha had to hear.
OTHER	You're a big boy.
SAMANTHA	Hello.
SAMANTHA	I understand that your child and I have to coexist in this city.
SAMANTHA	But perhaps you could take him somewhere more appropriate for a Happy Meal so I could have a happier one.
OTHER	"Seamus, that wasn't very nice."
SAMANTHA	I've made my point and he's made his.
CHARLOTTE	Honey!
HARRY 	"Hello, beautiful."
CHARLOTTE	Hi.
HARRY 	Do you know what we need to bring back in this house?
HARRY 	Cocktail hour.
CARRIE	Charlotte realized there was something grosser than teabags all over her house.
CARRIE	Her husband's teabags all over her new white couch.
CHARLOTTE	Harry!
HARRY 	what?
CHARLOTTE	"No, I feel bad."
HARRY 	about what?
CHARLOTTE	"I'm trying to be less rigid, and I really do want you to be yourself in our house."
HARRY 	I know you do and I appreciate it.
CHARLOTTE	And I'm almost used to the whole naked thing.
HARRY 	I knew it was too much.
HARRY 	It's just me.
HARRY 	But I can put on clothes.
CHARLOTTE	No.
CHARLOTTE	I want you to be yourself.
CHARLOTTE	It's just
CHARLOTTE	Maybe you could put something between yourself and the white couch.
HARRY 	I get it.
HARRY 	We've got kind of an ass-white couch situation here.
HARRY 	I will put on shorts.
CHARLOTTE	Could you?
HARRY 	Of course.
CHARLOTTE	Now?
CHARLOTTE	Love you.
ROBERT	"Miranda, are you in there? I can see your feet under the door."
IRANDA	Damn.
ROBERT	I Just came by to Check up on you.
IRANDA	I'm fine.
ROBERT	I've seen it all.
ROBERT	"I'm a doctor, remember?"
IRANDA	I'm fine.
IRANDA	Come on in.
ROBERT	It's not that bad.
ROBERT	"I've seen a 7' tall man's shinbone poking through his calf, so"
ROBERT	Where's Brady?
IRANDA	He's asleep.
ROBERT	Too bad.
ROBERT	I wanted to give him this.
IRANDA	I'm pretty sure his hand-eye coordination is still a little sub-par to make the team.
ROBERT	"If he's gonna go pro, we gotta start him young."
ROBERT	What are you watching?
IRANDA	It's just Jules & Mimi.
IRANDA	It's silly.
ROBERT	Yeah? What's it about?
IRANDA	"Well, that's Mimi."
IRANDA	She's the landlord.
IRANDA	"Right next to her there is Jules, and they've slept together a couple of times but Jules may be involved with the girl who works in the sausage shop."
IRANDA	in a nutshell.
ROBERT	he seems to be pretty into her now.
ROBERT	I'm intrigued.
IRANDA	Really?
ROBERT	That and my cable's not hooked up yet.
IMI	"Jules, you know, you didn't have to bring the rent over in person."
JULES	What's a few tube stops between friends?
ROBERT	I love a brother with an accent.
IMI	Do you think we'll stay friends after this?
JULES	I hope not.
JULES	You're so soft!
CARRIE	"That night, I decided I couldn't wait for a ring."
CARRIE	And so I gave someone else one.
ANSWERING MACHINE	this is Milo.
ANSWERING MACHINE	this is Allegra.
ANSWERING MACHINE	"Mommy, and Daddy, and baby Henry, and us aren't here."
ANSWERING MACHINE	Leave a message.
CARRIE	"Hi, it's Carrie Bradshaw."
CARRIE	I wanted to let you know that I'm getting married.
CARRIE	To myself.
CARRIE	And I'm registered at Manolo Blahnik.
CARRIE	So thanks.
CARRIE	Bye.
CARRIE	"One giant step for me, one small step for single womankind."
SALESGIRL	Here they are.
KYRA	That's all she registered for?
SALESGIRL	That'll be
KYRA	485
SALESGIRL	Plus tax.
SALESGIRL	And could you please watch your children?
SALESGIRL	We don't want them touching the shoes.
SALESGIRL	Thanks.
CARRIE	It was my very first wedding present.
CARRIE	"The fact is, sometimes it's hard to walk in a single woman's shoes."
CARRIE	That's why we need really special ones now and then.
CARRIE	To make the walk a little more fun.
CARRIE	I didn't go to my high school reunion.
CARRIE	So when my high-school sweetheart called me for a reunion I was curious to see if he looked like the boy I used to make out with in front of my locker.
JEREMY	Can you tell me how to get to Chemistry class?
CARRIE	"Actually, he looked better."
CARRIE	"My God, Jeremy!"
JEREMY	That's my name.
JEREMY	Don't wear it out.
CARRIE	Wow! You look great!
JEREMY	I knew you looked great 'cause I saw you on the cover of your book.
JEREMY	"But I have to say, even better in person."
CARRIE	"God, I'm so glad you called."
JEREMY	"I'm going to be spending the month in Connecticut, so I had to look you up."
CARRIE	How are you?
CARRIE	I heard you married somebody that you met in business school.
JEREMY	Yeah.
JEREMY	"I got divorced, like, two years ago."
JEREMY	Really miscalculated that one.
JEREMY	So I'm on my own again.
JEREMY	How about you? Are you seeing anybody or
CARRIE	Nope.
CARRIE	Wide open.
JEREMY	how is That possible?
CARRIE	My high school boyfriend spoiled me for life.
JEREMY	Right.
JEREMY	Me and my AMC Pacer.
CARRIE	"Oh, the Pacer! Oh, man!"
JEREMY	I put our names down for a table.
CARRIE	great.
JEREMY	"Look, earlier you said maybe you might have dinner plans."
JEREMY	Was that in case I turned out to be a
CARRIE	"Yeah, maybe."
CARRIE	But my fictional plans fell through so I'm available.
CARRIE	"Miranda had no plans that night so she was thrilled when her cute, new neighbor stopped by."
ROBERT	I didn't expect you home on a Saturday night.
IRANDA	Motherhood.
ROBERT	So what's my excuse?
IRANDA	I just got Brady to sleep.
ROBERT	"now, do You sing to him?"
IRANDA	Only if he's been bad.
ROBERT	"Listen, I have these two courtside seats for the Knicks charity game at the Garden next Friday night."
ROBERT	Would You want to go?
IRANDA	I Would love to.
ROBERT	Great.
ROBERT	great.
ROBERT	I'll look for you there.
IRANDA	Okay.
IRANDA	Thanks So much.
ROBERT	good night.
IRANDA	"You, too."
CARRIE	Miranda wasn't sure if it was a charity game or just charity.
CARRIE	I didn't even ask what you were doing in Connecticut.
JEREMY	"Nothing, for a change."
JEREMY	I spent the last decade working my ass off in Denver so I decided to take a month off.
JEREMY	Spend some time at sea level.
JEREMY	"So I've just been relaxing in the country, sorting through some things, you know."
JEREMY	Sometimes you need to get away.
JEREMY	Sometimes you wonder why you stayed away so long.
CARRIE	"Well, this is my place."
JEREMY	It's a nice place.
CARRIE	"Yeah, I love It here."
JEREMY	"I feel like I want to kiss you, but I I don't know what"
CARRIE	I know.
CARRIE	It's very unclear.
JEREMY	"I mean, this isn't a first date."
JEREMY	We've already dated.
CARRIE	And we've kissed.
JEREMY	many times.
CARRIE	hours.
JEREMY	We were in a lip-lock for most of 1982.
CARRIE	So what's one more kiss?
JEREMY	You mean business.
JEREMY	That's a lot better without the gearshift sticking up my ass.
CARRIE	"It was a romantic, hot summer night followed by a miserable, hot summer day which was the fourteenth miserable, hot summer day in a row."
PHOEBE	Samantha Jones.
PHOEBE	How are you?
SAMANTHA	"Great, Phoebe."
SAMANTHA	How are you?
PHOEBE	Refreshed.
PHOEBE	We just dropped by the Soho House for a dip.
PHOEBE	"I mean, what else can you possibly do in this heat except sit by the pool and drink cocktails while they mist you with Evian."
PHOEBE	Isn't it the best?
SAMANTHA	It's fabulous.
SAMANTHA	"I'm running to a lunch, otherwise I'd be up there myself."
SAMANTHA	Toodles.
SAMANTHA	There's a pool a block from my apartment and I can't get in.
CHARLOTTE	What pool?
SAMANTHA	at the Soho house.
SAMANTHA	You have to be a member and I'm on a bullshit wait list.
CARRIE	Don't they know who you are?
IRANDA	"and, more importantly, who we are who need to be at the pool with you."
SAMANTHA	"You know, in high school, all you had to do was jump a fence and you could be in somebody's pool."
CARRIE	"Speaking of high school, I saw my high-school sweetheart and I think I might like him."
CARRIE	Again.
CARRIE	is That crazy?
CHARLOTTE	"No, I love this."
CHARLOTTE	You could end up with your high-school boyfriend.
CARRIE	"Okay, let's not jump the gun."
CARRIE	It was the best date I've had in a long time and I wasn't even thinking it was a date.
CARRIE	when he kissed me good night
CHARLOTTE	he kissed You good night?
CARRIE	It was wild.
CARRIE	Because I actually remembered what it felt like to kiss him.
SAMANTHA	Imagine if you slept with him.
SAMANTHA	Talk about a homecoming.
CARRIE	No!
CARRIE	we never went All the way.
SAMANTHA	Why not?
CARRIE	Because we were kids.
CARRIE	We wanted to wait.
CARRIE	"And now, I think we've waited long enough."
CHARLOTTE	You're marrying him.
CARRIE	Will you stop? He doesn't even live in New York.
CARRIE	He lives in Denver.
CHARLOTTE	people move.
CHARLOTTE	It would be so romantic.
CARRIE	Or tragic.
CARRIE	Seriously.
CARRIE	If I had the guy in high school what have I been doing for the past 20 years?
IRANDA	Why did you two break up?
CARRIE	"I broke up because I thought, ""There must be better guys out there."
CARRIE	""" Turns out, there aren't."
CARRIE	That night I started thinking about my retro relationship.
CARRIE	"Since high school, most women I know have acquired much better taste in clothes, hairstyles, and food."
CARRIE	But what about in men? Maybe we were better off when we thought less and kissed more.
CARRIE	"Have we graduated past our ability to find true love? When it comes to matters of the heart, did we have it right in high school?"
CARRIE	Samantha was too cool to belong to any clubs in high school so she refused to believe that any club was too cool for her now.
CARRIE	Especially since New York in August is not cool at all.
SOHO HOUSE MANAGER	May I help you?
SAMANTHA	I hope so.
SAMANTHA	I'd like to know what's holding up my membership.
SAMANTHA	I've been on the wait list since June.
SOHO HOUSE MANAGER	"Yes, I'm sorry, but we are not currently admitting any new members."
SOHO HOUSE MANAGER	"The pool is so fabulous, we're at capacity every day."
SAMANTHA	do You know who I am?
SOHO HOUSE MANAGER	"No, I don't."
SOHO HOUSE MANAGER	But we can't accommodate you right now.
SAMANTHA	"Can I at least use the restroom before I go, or is there a wait list for that as well?"
SOHO HOUSE MANAGER	"Down the corridor on your left, the door marked ""WC."""
CLEANING LADY	"Miss, did you leave your card on the sink?"
SAMANTHA	"Oh, yes."
SAMANTHA	"Yes, I did."
SAMANTHA	Thank you so much.
CARRIE	Since they didn't seem to know who she was at the Soho House she figured she could be Annabelle Bronstein.
CARRIE	"The next day, Samantha tested the waters with her fake ID."
ALE POOL ATTENDANT	"Excuse me, can I get you something to drink, Miss Bronstein?"
SAMANTHA	"Yes, but I'll just pay cash."
SAMANTHA	"And please, call me Annabelle."
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, a fight was about to break out in the cafeteria."
CARRIE	"But this time, Cafeteria was a trendy restaurant in Chelsea."
CHARLOTTE	Thank you.
STANFORD	"God, I hate him."
STANFORD	"Come on, we're going over there."
ARCUS	Why?
STANFORD	Because you're in a tank top.
CHARLOTTE	Really.
CHARLOTTE	Hi.
STANFORD	"Oh, Hi."
CHARLOTTE	You're here.
CHARLOTTE	What a small world.
ANTHONY	That's Chelsea for you.
ANTHONY	Can't swing a dick without running into someone you know.
STANFORD	"We'd love to stay and chat, but we have to go get our tuxes for the prom."
CHARLOTTE	"Did you say ""the prom""?"
STANFORD	"Yes, it's a big fundraiser at the gay-lesbian-bi-transgender center."
STANFORD	I'm on the decorations committee.
ANTHONY	"What's the theme, ""Queer and Queerer""?"
CHARLOTTE	I have the best memories of my prom.
CHARLOTTE	I was the prom queen.
ANTHONY	"Of course you were, darling."
STANFORD	I missed my prom in high school because
ANTHONY	You were gay.
STANFORD	No.
STANFORD	My girlfriend and I broke up the night before because
ANTHONY	You were gay.
STANFORD	"No, I wasn't gay until"
ANTHONY	You were born.
STANFORD	Never mind.
STANFORD	"Goodbye, Charlotte."
ARCUS	Bye.
CHARLOTTE	"Bye, Marcus."
ANTHONY	Those two should be going to the gay-lesbian-and-prostitute prom.
CHARLOTTE	be nice.
ANTHONY	what? I happen to know That Marcus used to be a gay escort.
CHARLOTTE	he was not.
ANTHONY	"honey, wake up and smell the K-Y."
ANTHONY	I was flipping through a vintage issue of Honcho.
ANTHONY	I saw his ad in the Rauncho section.
ANTHONY	He called himself Paul.
ANTHONY	Worst hustler name I ever heard.
CHARLOTTE	He and Stanford are in love.
ANTHONY	"Well, according to Honcho, he used to be in love all over town."
CHARLOTTE	You are mistaken.
ANTHONY	There's a picture.
ANTHONY	I'll send you the ad.
CHARLOTTE	I don't want to see it.
ANTHONY	"I'm sending it, prom queen."
WAITER	What can I get you?
ANTHONY	Cute waiter.
CHARLOTTE	I wish I didn't know this.
CHARLOTTE	Do you think Stanford knows?
IRANDA	"Probably not, so maybe we shouldn't talk about it in Madison Square Garden."
CHARLOTTE	I don't think that these people know those people.
IRANDA	look at how Cute he is.
CHARLOTTE	he is gorgeous.
IRANDA	He looked at me.
IRANDA	Did you see him look at me?
CHARLOTTE	he totally likes you.
IRANDA	You think?
CHARLOTTE	Look at these seats.
IRANDA	You're right.
IRANDA	These seats are too good to be casual.
ANNOUNCER	"Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the Knicks City Dancers."
CHARLOTTE	Did I ever tell you I was a cheerleader?
IRANDA	"No, because you knew I would mock you endlessly."
IRANDA	Did you used to do that?
CHARLOTTE	"No, we just did some kerkies and some kicks."
CHARLOTTE	What is she doing?
IRANDA	the blonde one in front?
CHARLOTTE	She's flirting with your boyfriend.
IRANDA	He's not my boyfriend.
CHARLOTTE	"What is she, like, 21?"
CARRIE	"It was Friday night, it was the big game and Miranda was jealous of a cheerleader."
CARRIE	"Two hours later, the game ended and Miranda felt like the loser."
IRANDA	"Okay, let's just go."
CHARLOTTE	"No, you have to go over there and talk to him."
IRANDA	He's talking to her.
CHARLOTTE	You are better than her.
CHARLOTTE	Go on.
CHARLOTTE	You can do it.
IRANDA	are You gonna do a herkie now?
CHARLOTTE	Just You Go over There and flirt a little bit.
CHARLOTTE	Go.
CHARLOTTE	Go.
ANNOUNCER	The Knicks and Madison Square Garden thank you for coming.
ANNOUNCER	Have a safe trip home.
IRANDA	That's it.
IRANDA	I'm out.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, I invited Jeremy to come over and watch a movie which in high school was code for, ""Come over and make out."""
CARRIE	"And happily, it still was."
JEREMY	I've gotta run.
JEREMY	Last train leaves in half an hour.
CARRIE	I think you should stay.
CARRIE	I think we should go all the way.
JEREMY	All the way?
CARRIE	we never did.
CARRIE	"And now we can, and your mother won't walk in with her laundry and her TaB."
JEREMY	That's true.
JEREMY	"Carrie, I need to be honest with you about something."
CARRIE	That's the worst thing you can hear from someone you really like.
JEREMY	I'm not really just taking time off.
JEREMY	I'm sort of in a mental institution.
CARRIE	"No, actually, that's the worst thing you can hear."
CARRIE	"I wanted a man who would commit, not a man who was committed."
CARRIE	"Apparently, we have to be more specific."
CHARLOTTE	But how is he able to see you?
ANTHONY	did he escape?
CARRIE	"No, he's voluntary."
CARRIE	He says it's not really a mental institution it's a therapeutic community.
SAMANTHA	Which one?
CARRIE	Juno-Spears.
SAMANTHA	That's supposed to be a good one.
SAMANTHA	I've had clients go there.
STANFORD	Really? Why haven't we heard about that?
SAMANTHA	Because I'm good at my job.
SAMANTHA	No one wants to admit they're in a loony bin.
CARRIE	on a first date.
IRANDA	It's all humiliating.
IRANDA	Think about what we have to go through to date.
IRANDA	"I am 38, and I am competing with a cheerleader."
CARRIE	"And even when you get the guy, you never know what fun surprise might be revealed."
STANFORD	"Let me tell you something, ladies."
STANFORD	"In a good relationship, there are no surprises."
STANFORD	"I know everything about Marcus, and Marcus knows everything about me."
CHARLOTTE	I don't think he knows everything.
CARRIE	What? What?
CARRIE	"Charlotte, like all girls, learned at an early age that the only way to get rid of information you don't want to have is to pass it on."
CARRIE	"Oh, my God! Is this real?"
CHARLOTTE	Anthony found it in an old issue of Honcho magazine.
SAMANTHA	Let me see that.
SAMANTHA	"Oh, my! Is that Marcus?"
STANFORD	What is that?
SAMANTHA	Nothing.
STANFORD	"Okay, hand it over."
STANFORD	"Okay, hand it over."
STANFORD	Where did this come from? Someone better tell me where this came from right now.
STANFORD	I'm not kidding.
SAMANTHA	I got It from Carrie.
CARRIE	I got It from Miranda.
IRANDA	I got It from Charlotte.
CHARLOTTE	I got It from Anthony But I told Him You and Marcus were very much in love.
CARRIE	Charlotte was still a cheerleader for love.
CARRIE	"But like the Knicks, her team was having a bad season."
STANFORD	"Well, you think you know somebody"
ANAGER	"Excuse me, which one of you is Annabelle Bronstein?"
SAMANTHA	I am.
ANAGER	"Well, that's impossible."
ANAGER	Miss Bronstein is in London for the week.
SAMANTHA	"No, I am Annabelle Bronstein."
ANAGER	And she's British.
SAMANTHA	"As I was saying, dear sir I am Annabelle Bronstein."
ANAGER	I'm fairly certain you're not Annabelle.
ANAGER	I've spoken to her on the phone.
SAMANTHA	I am absolutely Annabelle Bronstein and I do not pay $900 annually to be treated like this.
SAMANTHA	"Now, ring round the waiter and have him tally up the drinks."
IRANDA	What's with the accent?
CARRIE	She's got a case of the Madonnas.
ANAGER	"I'm sorry, but I know for a fact that Annabelle lost her card."
SAMANTHA	"Yes, I thought I did but it was on top of the telly."
ANAGER	"And Miss Bronstein is from Sussex, as am I and I'd venture to guess that you are not, in fact, from the UK."
SAMANTHA	That's true.
SAMANTHA	I was raised in Inja.
CARRIE	"On any given day, there are a lot of versions of ""crazy"" right here in New York."
CARRIE	"Today, Annabelle Bronstein had multiple personalities and at least two accents."
ROBERT	"Hey, Hobbes."
ROBERT	Where did you disappear to after the game?
IRANDA	"I was gonna thank you, but you were talking to that girl."
ROBERT	What girl?
IRANDA	some cheerleader.
IRANDA	do You like her?
ROBERT	no.
ROBERT	I like someone else.
ROBERT	You.
CARRIE	This cheered Miranda up immediately.
IRANDA	"Now, see, how would I know that?"
ROBERT	Well
ROBERT	Would it be any clearer if I did this?
IRANDA	"Hi, Mrs. McCaffrey."
ROBERT	"Hello, Mrs. McCaffrey."
JEREMY	I wanted you to have these.
JEREMY	Marbles.
JEREMY	"In case I lose any more of mine, I want to know where I can find a stash."
CARRIE	how are you? do You want to come in?
JEREMY	she asked with trepidation.
CARRIE	"No, I think it's great what you're doing"
JEREMY	"I know I probably threw you for a loop the other day, but"
JEREMY	"I should probably just come right out and say something about this, but I"
JEREMY	"Truth is, I haven't worked out my rap on it yet."
CARRIE	"Well, it's a tough thing to slip in."
JEREMY	"Yeah, It is."
JEREMY	"""Hi, I might be crazy."
JEREMY	"Would you like to share an appetizer?"" The thing is, I think I made it sound worse than it is."
JEREMY	"If you saw Juno-Spears, you'd see it's not a cuckoo's nest."
JEREMY	It's more like Canyon Ranch for the brain.
CARRIE	do they have pilates?
JEREMY	they do have pilates.
JEREMY	I don't want to lie to you.
JEREMY	I am going through some pretty heavy stuff.
JEREMY	"I mean, soul-searching, really."
JEREMY	Trying to figure out why some things seem to be harder for me than they are for other people.
JEREMY	I think my family has something to do with it.
JEREMY	"It's good to blame the parents, right?"
CARRIE	Right.
JEREMY	So I figured I could spend the next five years in therapy or spend the next month and deal with it intensively right now.
JEREMY	It's just more efficient.
CARRIE	You make a very good case.
JEREMY	That's what my doctors say.
JEREMY	"Well, that's it."
JEREMY	Ta-da! I just wanted to explain myself so that I didn't become known eternally as that nut case you dated back in high school.
CARRIE	"How about ""my high-school boyfriend who was the best kisser ever""?"
JEREMY	I could live with that.
JEREMY	"You're not bad yourself, either, you know."
CARRIE	That night we went all the way.
CARRIE	And we weren't the only ones.
CARRIE	"The next afternoon, my other crazy boyfriend stopped by."
STANFORD	It's true.
STANFORD	Marcus was a gay escort.
STANFORD	But he's been off the market since 1992.
CARRIE	So You talked about it?
STANFORD	"Yes, and he says he did it just to put himself through dance classes."
STANFORD	"But if that's true, then why keep it a secret?"
CARRIE	Maybe he was embarrassed.
STANFORD	"Yes, but it's not the escort thing but the secret thing that's bothering me."
STANFORD	I was the last to know.
STANFORD	I don't want to hear the truth from some bitchy queen with back issues of Honcho.
STANFORD	So we broke up.
CARRIE	"Stanny, Really?"
STANFORD	Yes.
STANFORD	And right before the prom.
STANFORD	"And I still have to go, because I'm on the decorations committee."
STANFORD	And I have no date.
STANFORD	Again.
CARRIE	when is it?
STANFORD	Tomorrow night.
STANFORD	Will you please go with me?
CARRIE	I can't.
CARRIE	I have to visit my boyfriend at the asylum.
STANFORD	Of course you do.
CARRIE	He wants me to see the place for myself.
CARRIE	It's supposed to be like Canyon Ranch.
STANFORD	honey.
CARRIE	I know.
CARRIE	But I like him.
STANFORD	You'd have to.
CARRIE	"Who are we to say, he's got issues, he's getting help? Usually, that's considered a good thing."
CARRIE	It's New York.
CARRIE	Everybody's insane.
STANFORD	"You slept with him, didn't you?"
CARRIE	Yes.
STANFORD	That's where the problems begin.
STANFORD	"You sleep with someone, you start rationalizing away all the red flags."
CARRIE	At least he was honest about it.
STANFORD	"Yes, unlike Paul."
CARRIE	"Apparently, the Juno-Spears Center was harder than the Soho House to get into."
CARRIE	Or out of.
CARRIE	"Even as a visitor, I could see how this was a very relaxing place to get away to."
JEREMY	"It's kind of nice, huh? There are great hiking trails all around here."
JEREMY	Maybe Later we can do a hike.
CARRIE	I don't really hike.
JEREMY	Neither do I.
JEREMY	But I will fill you in on something I discovered.
JEREMY	Hiking is walking.
CARRIE	Really?
JEREMY	"Yes, hiking is walking."
CARRIE	I started to think maybe the Juno-Spears Center should be mandatory for New Yorkers.
CARRIE	Like the Hamptons or Fire Island.
PATIENT	Feces!
JEREMY	I guess that doesn't happen very often at Canyon Ranch.
CARRIE	I've never been.
CARRIE	It might.
JEREMY	Who am I kidding? This is a full-on psychiatric facility.
CARRIE	With pilates.
CARRIE	You're definitely the sanest person here.
JEREMY	Thank you.
JEREMY	That's like being the best house on a bad block.
JEREMY	People would advise you against buying it.
JEREMY	Maybe it wasn't the wisest thing to start something while I was still in here.
JEREMY	Maybe when I get out in eight to ten months
CARRIE	Eight to ten months?
JEREMY	My doctor still thinks I have a lot of work to do.
JEREMY	"To be honest with you, I'm comfortable here."
JEREMY	I kind of like it.
JEREMY	I like that everybody's craziness is out in the open.
CARRIE	I loved seeing you.
JEREMY	I loved seeing You again.
JEREMY	But I understand.
JEREMY	We're just in very different places right now.
CARRIE	"Ironically, it was the sanest breakup I ever had."
EMCEE	"And now, the Queen and Queen of our prom Carrie Bradshaw and Stanford Blatch."
CARRIE	
STANFORD	"me, too."
CARRIE	Thank you very much.
STANFORD	This is my best prom ever.
STANFORD	Thank you for coming.
CARRIE	"Believe me, I'm glad to be back with the normal people."
CARRIE	You know the craziest thing of all? I somehow thought that after everything I've been through I might end up with my high-school boyfriend.
CARRIE	I don't think my story's going to get tied up like that.
STANFORD	your Boyfriend might get tied up.
CARRIE	and taken away.
CARRIE	"Okay, no more jokes."
CARRIE	I might be dating him in eight to ten months.
ARCUS	May I cut in?
STANFORD	"No, thank you."
STANFORD	I already have an escort.
ARCUS	"Honey, I didn't tell you because it's part of my past."
ARCUS	It's not who I am anymore.
ARCUS	"I was really messed up back then, but I've got it together now."
ARCUS	And it's prom night.
ARCUS	We have to have a dance.
CARRIE	Why don't I get some punch?
STANFORD	Just tell me one thing.
STANFORD	"Did you ever, ever sleep with that little bitchy pine nut, Anthony?"
ARCUS	No.
ARCUS	"God, no."
CARRIE	"So, maybe it won't look the way you thought it would look in high school."
CARRIE	But it's good to remember love is possible.
CARRIE	Anything is possible.
CARRIE	This is New York.
CARRIE	"There are some New York nights that are monumental, gigantic, historic."
CARRIE	"Others, are just big."
CARRIE	"Bet you can't get your steaks like this in your little Napa Village,"
CARRIE	now can ya?
BIG	Where do yo think these cattle comes from?
BIG	A ranch on Canal Street?
CARRIE	"Well, what we lack in livestock,"
CARRIE	we make up for in cabs.
BIG	Napa has cabs.
CARRIE	"Fine, you win, and I don't wanna fight about it."
BIG	"Oh, let's. Let's fight, then we can make out."
CARRIE	"So, what's on your New York agenda?"
CARRIE	"Making some deals, breaking some hearts?"
BIG	Can I tell you a secret?
CARRIE	That's not your real hair?
BIG	I'm having a little heart thing done.
CARRIE	What?
BIG	"They found a blockage. So I'm getting a, you know,"
BIG	angioplasty.
BIG	"Simple procedure, no big deal."
BIG	"But,"
BIG	I can kiss these good bye.
BIG	Carrie.
BIG	Calm down.
BIG	Come on. Don't be such a sissy.
BIG	It's nothing.
BIG	They do a million of these a day.
BIG	It's like having your teeth cleaned.
WAITER	"Um, miss?"
BIG	"Um,"
BIG	she's fine.
BIG	Could you bring some extra napkins?
BIG	And some violins.
CARRIE	"Uptown, there was a different kind of dinner being prepared."
CARRIE	With less cholesterol and no tears.
IRANDA	Oh my god.
ROBERT	Hey.
IRANDA	"How ever you got in here,"
IRANDA	"I don't care,"
IRANDA	I applaud you.
CARRIE	"Miranda's new neighbor, Doctor Robert"
CARRIE	had quicky become her new boyfriend.
CARRIE	Doctor of all trades.
ROBERT	Magda let me in. She was very excited at the idea of
ROBERT	someone actually using your kitchen to prepare food.
IRANDA	"Well, it's a first."
IRANDA	I didn't know you could cook.
ROBERT	I make one thing.
ROBERT	"Enchiladas, baby."
IRANDA	Spicy.
ROBERT	You can handle it.
IRANDA	Oh my god.
IRANDA	I have place's mats?
IRANDA	How am I gonna repay you for all this?
IRANDA	I only make lean cuisine.
ROBERT	I have one idea.
IRANDA	Done.
ROBERT	"No, it's another idea. But it's related."
ROBERT	Take tomorrow off.
IRANDA	From work?
IRANDA	I don't do that.
ROBERT	Just think about it.
ROBERT	"Brady's with his dad,"
ROBERT	I don't have to work until seven. We can spend the whole day together.
ROBERT	Bet you have a few personal days stored up.
ROBERT	Just think about it.
CARRIE	"Truth be told, Miranda had never taken a personal day in her entire career."
CARRIE	"But then again, no one had ever made her enchiladas before."
STEVE	"Whoa, geez, whoa."
IRANDA	Arghh.
ROBERT	"Oh, Oh, Hey."
IRANDA	"Steve, what are you doing here?"
IRANDA	"Oh my god, are you ok?"
STEVE	I see spots.
ROBERT	Let me take a look at that.
STEVE	Who the hell are you?
IRANDA	What are you doing here?
STEVE	I forgot Brady's eardrops.
STEVE	What are you doing here?
IRANDA	I took a personal day.
ROBERT	I'm Robert.
IRANDA	this is Robert.
ROBERT	I'm a doctor.
IRANDA	He's doctor
IRANDA	and my boyfriend.
IRANDA	I'm sorry. Is it weird that I just called you that?
ROBERT	"No, I like it."
STEVE	"Hey, do you wanna help me here or what?"
ROBERT	"Yeah, yeah, let's take this in the bathroom."
ROBERT	Can you get some ice?
ROBERT	Bend your head forward slightly and have a seat.
STEVE	"So, how long have you two been hanging out?"
IRANDA	"Oh, about a month."
IRANDA	I was gonna mention it when the time was right.
IRANDA	I was just waiting for the right time.
ROBERT	Apply pressure.
IRANDA	"So, anyway, this is Steve,"
IRANDA	Brady's dad.
ROBERT	"good to meet You, Steve."
IRANDA	Oh my god. Who's watching the baby?
STEVE	"My ma, and Debbie."
ROBERT	"Yeah, it should be fine. It's just bruised."
ROBERT	I'm gonna need a tampon.
IRANDA	what?
STEVE	What the fuck?
ROBERT	"It's a little trick we use at work,"
ROBERT	and some scissors.
STEVE	"What are you, some nose guy or something?"
ROBERT	"No, I'm in sports medicine."
IRANDA	For the Knicks.
CARRIE	Adding insult to injury.
ROBERT	"Now, this should do it."
IRANDA	"So, that pretty much solves the problem"
IRANDA	of how Robert and Steve are going to meet.
IRANDA	I guess I can check that off my list of things to do.
CARRIE	That's horrifying.
CARRIE	I will continue to be horrified by that story all day long.
IRANDA	"And poor Steve,"
IRANDA	"he was in such a vulnerable position with the sex and the bloody nose,"
IRANDA	and the doctor boyfriend.
SAMANTHA	"Well, you won."
CHARLOTTE	It's not a competition.
SAMANTHA	You're right.
SAMANTHA	"She's being fucked by a hot, black doctor and Steve had a tampon up his nose."
SAMANTHA	No contest.
IRANDA	"Ok, I hate to admit this,"
IRANDA	but there is part of me that took some pleasure in the whole thing.
IRANDA	Is that terrible?
CHARLOTTE	"Well, no. It's not as like you planned it that way,"
CHARLOTTE	did you?
IRANDA	No.
IRANDA	I'm crazy about Robert.
IRANDA	"So, why do I even care what Steve thinks?"
CARRIE	Because you've been through a lot with him.
CARRIE	Some people just get under your skin and stay there.
CARRIE	"When I say Big the other night,.."
CHARLOTTE	big is in town?
CARRIE	"Yeah, he's here for a little heart thing."
IRANDA	What? Is he on the list to get one?
CARRIE	No.
CARRIE	And you're going to feel incredibly bad in a minute.
CARRIE	He's here because he's having heart surgery.
IRANDA	"Ok, I'm officially a monster. Please continue."
CARRIE	"No, it's ok."
CARRIE	It's actually a fairly routine procedure. They found a blockage.
SAMANTHA	Honey.
CARRIE	I'm sorry.
CARRIE	This is exactly what happened the other night when he told me.
CARRIE	"I know, I know he's gonna be fine."
CARRIE	"But,"
CARRIE	what is going on with me?
BITSY VON MUFFLING	"Yoo hoo, ladies lunching."
CARRIE	"Bitsy Von Muffling had recentlymarried cabaret singer, Bobby Fine"
CARRIE	known to everyone but Bitsy as the gayest gay man alive.
BITSY VON MUFFLING	Hi.
CARRIE	My goodness. Look at you.
BITSY VON MUFFLING	"Can you believe it? Me, pregnant."
BITSY VON MUFFLING	"It's a girl Bobby is so excited, he's already got two names picked out."
BITSY VON MUFFLING	Judy or Barbara.
BITSY VON MUFFLING	We're gonna wait to what she looks like.
IRANDA	I like Judy.
BITSY VON MUFFLING	And I owe it all to Dr. Mao.
BITSY VON MUFFLING	"Or as we call him Dr. Wow,"
BITSY VON MUFFLING	acupuncturist slash miracle worker.
BITSY VON MUFFLING	"Seriously, I couldn't take it anymore with the IUl's, and the IVF's, and the I give up."
BITSY VON MUFFLING	"Anyway, then I go to this guy, and poof, I'm with child."
CHARLOTTE	Just from going to acupuncture?
BITSY VON MUFFLING	"I don't know how the hell it works, but this guy could get a cactus pregnant."
BITSY VON MUFFLING	"Anyway, I've got to run."
BITSY VON MUFFLING	"Or shall I say, waddle."
BITSY VON MUFFLING	It was great seeing you girls.
SAMANTHA	Bye.
CHARLOTTE	How is that physically possible?
CHARLOTTE	That woman is like 50 years old.
SAMANTHA	And married to a fag.
CHARLOTTE	I have got to go see that Dr. Mao.
CHARLOTTE	Hello.
CHARLOTTE	I have a three o'clock with Dr. Mao?
CAROL	I know someone who tried for 5 years and never saw results.
FRAN	Did she drink the teas religiously?
FRAN	"Tell her to drink the teas. They're smelly, but they work."
PATIENT	My friend Lois got pregnant on her third visit.
FRAN	"I knew a woman who was told she'd never get pregnant ever,"
FRAN	because she wasn't ovulating.
FRAN	"And guess what,she's expecting her fourth this Christmas."
WOMAN	That's fabulous.
CHARLOTTE	And then this woman said that the teas and the herbs are really important.
CHARLOTTE	"And I'm just wondering because I started facility treatments with my first husband,"
CHARLOTTE	but now I'm remarried.
CHARLOTTE	"So, this woman thought that I should.."
DR. MAO	"Mrs. Goldenblatt,"
DR. MAO	I have all that information.
DR. MAO	"Let's just concentrate on what we're doing here,"
DR. MAO	in this room.
DR. MAO	"Now, I'll be back in twenty minutes."
DR. MAO	Just relax with your own thoughts.
FRAN	"I knew a woman who was told she'd never get pregnant ever,"
FRAN	"because she wasn't ovulating. And guess what,"
FRAN	she's expecting her fourth this Christmas.
CARRIE	From eastern medicine on the Upper West Side
CARRIE	Hello?
CARRIE	to western medicine on Upper East Side.
BIG	"Hey, kid."
CARRIE	How are you?
BIG	I'm alive.
CARRIE	Asshole.
BIG	What did you think? I'd be dead already?
CARRIE	I don't know.
CARRIE	Hospitals scare me.
BIG	"Oh, I'm fine. I'm great."
BIG	I've never felt better.
BIG	"Boy, you should've seen your face."
BIG	You're such an easy mark.
BIG	"Oh, oh. It's Ruby time."
BIG	Ruby's my favorite.
RUBY	"He says that to all the nurses, doesn't he?"
CARRIE	It's a safe assumption.
RUBY	"All right, darling. Come on. Up."
BIG	"Oh boy, there she goes again."
BIG	"All waterworks. come on, take it easy."
CARRIE	I'm sorry. Just ignore me.
RUBY	"Oh, so sweet. She's worried about you."
RUBY	Don't cry. You husband will be fine.
CARRIE	"No, no, I'm not. He's not my husband."
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, Samantha welcomed Smith back from his movie location"
CARRIE	with open arms.
SAMANTHA	"Now, put your index finger on my clit."
SAMANTHA	"Oh, good."
SAMANTHA	But less pressure.
SAMANTHA	"Ok, now two fingers."
SAMANTHA	A little higher.
SAMANTHA	A little bit more to the left.
SAMANTHA	"Now, do you feel that?"
SMITH	Did you take a directing seminar while I was gone?
SAMANTHA	I did some summer reading.
SAMANTHA	"Ok, now keep your finger there but move your thumb."
SAMANTHA	"Higher, higher."
SAMANTHA	"Oh, I missed those hands."
SMITH	"So, What do You want to eat?"
CARRIE	"Later, without directions,"
CARRIE	Smith tried the most intimate hand position of all.
SAMANTHA	I don't know. What do you feel like?
SMITH	"Sushi, maybe."
SMITH	Or Thai.
SAMANTHA	"Oh, I just had.."
SMITH	Babe?
SMITH	You ok?
SAMANTHA	I have a new sympathy for the disabled.
CARRIE	What happened to you?
SAMANTHA	"Oh, I'm fine, I just fell into one of those hatches on the sidewalk."
SAMANTHA	It was stupid.
CARRIE	"Oh my god, that's my biggest fear. How did that happen?"
SAMANTHA	It was Smith's fault.
SAMANTHA	He did something to me that was so perverse.
SAMANTHA	"Ok, I'm just gonna say it."
SAMANTHA	He tried to hold my hand.
CARRIE	You mean to tell me that Smith is a hand-holder?
CARRIE	And to think he once served us food.
SAMANTHA	"You laugh, but it's part of a bigger problem."
SAMANTHA	Do you know I didn't fuck a single or a married guy
SAMANTHA	the whole time Smith was out of town. And I'll tell you something else.
SAMANTHA	I missed him.
CARRIE	"Well, it sounds to me like he missed you too."
CARRIE	Hence the deviant behavior.
CARRIE	"Like it or not, that little tadpole is wide open in there for you."
CARRIE	"Life's short,"
CARRIE	you might wanna consider holding his hand.
SAMANTHA	Yuck.
CARRIE	"Ok, it happened again. The crying."
CARRIE	When I visited Big at the hospital.
CARRIE	That's three times now.
SAMANTHA	I suggest water proof mascara.
CARRIE	I finally figured out that the only way to have Big in my life was to
CARRIE	"block oput certain feelings, and now"
CARRIE	every feeling that I've ever had is bubbling up all over the place
CARRIE	with nowhere to go except my eye balls.
SAMANTHA	"So, what are you gonna do about it?"
CARRIE	Nothing. There's nothing to do.
CARRIE	Big is who he is. He's never gonna change.
CARRIE	He's limited and I acept that.
CARRIE	"So, he'll go back to Napa, and I'll go back to not crying."
CARRIE	The end.
CARRIE	"Honey, if it hurts so much, why are we going shopping?"
SAMANTHA	"I have a broken toe, not a broken spirit."
CARRIE	"Well, come on then. Move that booty."
CARRIE	"If New York City's signature fruit is the apple,"
CARRIE	then its signature sound is the ambulance siren.
CARRIE	"It seems like all day, every day people are getting hurt."
CARRIE	And the whole city has to hear about it.
CARRIE	But what about the injuries that don't get a siren.
CARRIE	Whether you're falling into the hole in the street
CARRIE	or possibly falling back in love.
CARRIE	Just how dangerous is an open heart?
CARRIE	"Hi, can I please be connected to room 817?"
OPERATOR	Let me see.
OPERATOR	That patient left the hospital this morning.
BIG	Well.
BIG	How d'you find me?
CARRIE	"When you weren't at the morgue,"
CARRIE	"I figured you were at the Four Seasons, and here you are."
BIG	"You know I'd invite you in, Sniffles."
BIG	but I've run out of Kleenex.
BIG	Should I call the concierge or did you bring your own?
CARRIE	"Oh, I'm sorry."
CARRIE	You must have me confused with someone else.
CARRIE	"I'm Candy, your Candy striper."
BIG	stop. - put your Coat back on.
BIG	Are you trying to kill me?
BIG	"I can't smoke, I can't drink,"
BIG	and I can't get excited.
BIG	About anything.
CARRIE	I'm in the union.
CARRIE	I know the rules.
BIG	"It's a damn shame, too"
BIG	because I love a cute candy stripper.
CARRIE	"This isn't about stripping, it's about striping."
BIG	"Um, it's a complete waste of hotel room if you ask me."
BIG	What are we gonna do now?
CARRIE	"Oh, Candy's got a whole bag full of PG fun in here."
BIG	"Oh, goodie."
CARRIE	Starting with
CARRIE	dominos.
CARRIE	Classic
BIG	Dominos?
CARRIE	and day glow.
BIG	"Why don't you just take off your dress and kill me now, get it over with?"
CARRIE	Nobody wins with that kind of attitude.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile across town,"
CARRIE	another caregiver has taken precautions.
IRANDA	"I know, I know. Almost done."
IRANDA	"Here, there we are."
IRANDA	Now we're..
CARRIE	"Steve might have gotten knocked out the other night,"
CARRIE	but Miranda had no idea his girlfriend was a knock-out.
STEVE	Hey.
DEBBIE	"Hi, Miranda."
IRANDA	"Hello, it's nice to.."
DEBBIE	Oh my gosh.
IRANDA	I'm fine.
IRANDA	It's nice to meet you. I'm Miranda.
STEVE	"This is my girlfriend, Debbie."
DEBBIE	Are you sure you're ok? You really came down hard there.
IRANDA	"I'm fine, really. Thank you."
DEBBIE	"Hey there, Bradylicious. Hi."
IRANDA	"Oh good, you're back."
IRANDA	"Robert, this is Debbie."
IRANDA	and You remember Steve.
ROBERT	Yeah.
ROBERT	"You're sure all right, babe?"
ROBERT	Cuz I saw you go flying there.
IRANDA	What?
IRANDA	I'm fine. It was nothing.
IRANDA	Robert is just over protective because he's a doctor.
DEBBIE	Oh.
IRANDA	for the Knicks.
DEBBIE	get out.
DEBBIE	"Did you hear that, Stevie? The Knicks!"
STEVE	"Yeah, yeah, I know."
DEBBIE	What a cool job!
DEBBIE	It's like crazy cool.
STEVE	"Debby works for Mastercard, corporate headquarters."
IRANDA	Really?
IRANDA	I have a Mastercard.
DEBBIE	You know Steve won't even let me talk on the phone
DEBBIE	when there's a Knicks game on.
DEBBIE	Even if I'm in the other room.
ROBERT	I didn't know you were a Knicks man.
STEVE	"Yeah, I follow all the New York teams."
DEBBIE	He lives for the Knicks.
DEBBIE	"One time he took me to a game, and our seats were so high up."
DEBBIE	What do they call that section?
IRANDA	The nosebleed section.
ROBERT	I can usually scrounge up a few courtside seats if you're ever interested.
STEVE	That's ok. I like my seats.
IRANDA	take the seats.
STEVE	I don't need the seats.
IRANDA	Take the seats.
CARRIE	"As Miranda and Steve continued needling each other on the playground,"
CARRIE	Dr. Mao was busy needling Charlotte in his office.
CARRIE	"And this time, she was determined to drown out the voices in her head."
DR. MAO	I'll be back in about twenty minutes.
DR. MAO	Just try to relax and find your center.
CHARLOTTE	Ok.
CARRIE	"Unfortunately, she couldn't drown out the voices on the street."
CARRIE	"When Charlotte opened her mind to Chinese medicine,"
CARRIE	she didn't expect a visit from the Cuban Liberation Front.
CHARLOTTE	Dr. Mao.
CHARLOTTE	Hello.
CHARLOTTE	Dr. Mao.
CHARLOTTE	I can't get centered.
CHARLOTTE	Is there a quieter room?
CHARLOTTE	"Cuz i'm trying to relax and find my center,"
CHARLOTTE	but I just can't do that with all these noise.
DR. MAO	"Charlotte,"
DR. MAO	the city will never quiet down.
DR. MAO	You're gonna have to learn to block out that New York noise
DR. MAO	and listen only to yourself.
CARRIE	Charlotte was beginning to think that the solution to her problem
CARRIE	"wasn't finding her center,"
CARRIE	but finding some earplugs.
SMITH	"The actors are cool, location was great."
SMITH	whole thing was off the hook.
SMITH	"Man, I missed you."
SAMANTHA	"Look, I know where you want to put your hand"
SAMANTHA	"and I'm sorry, but I'm just not that kind of girl."
SMITH	"Samantha, I like you,"
SMITH	you like me.
SMITH	And I've had enough with this horseshit.
SMITH	Just fucking hold my hand.
SAMANTHA	"Fine,"
SAMANTHA	but only until my foot heals.
CARRIE	And that's how Samantha lost her virginity to Smith.
BIG	Hmm. you've had too many on that end and they're crooked.
BIG	Especially those last four.
CARRIE	"Hey, I'm doing all the heavylifting here, you're sitting there like a log."
BIG	I'm in recovery.
CARRIE	"Oh, excuses, excuses."
BIG	And they're too closely spaced together.
BIG	"See, you don't understand the delicate balance of physics involved in this."
CARRIE	"Well, that's true, This is really more your generation's game,"
CARRIE	whereas I came of age in the parcheesi era.
BIG	"So I guess this is what we'd be like in our seventies, huh?"
BIG	No sex and board games.
CARRIE	"Oh, you're already thinking about your next birthday?"
BIG	"Seriously, kid."
BIG	"You and me,"
BIG	the earlybird special.
CARRIE	"Yes, save me a baked potato, I'll meet you there."
CARRIE	Are you ok?
CARRIE	"Oh my god, you're burning up."
CARRIE	"Here come on, let's get you in bed."
CARRIE	"Uh-huh, ok."
CARRIE	"Well, it's down to 101."
CARRIE	"Well, that's good to hear."
CARRIE	Right.
CARRIE	"So, I'll just keep doing what I'm doing."
CARRIE	"Ok, thank you so much, doctor."
CARRIE	"Well, he thinks you're gonna be fine."
CARRIE	Is this wash cloth still cold?
BIG	"Yeah, that feels nice."
CARRIE	Good.
BIG	"You're an angel, you know that?"
CARRIE	"Nah, I'm just doing my job."
BIG	I'm serious.
BIG	What are we doing?
BIG	I'm talking about us.
BIG	Life's too short.
BIG	What are we doing?
CARRIE	I don't know.
CARRIE	"It took the best heart surgeon in New York,"
CARRIE	but Big's heart was finally unblocked.
CARRIE	"In fact, it was wide open."
CARRIE	"The next morning by the light of day,"
CARRIE	both injured parties were rebounding nicely.
IRANDA	Hi.
IRANDA	"Hey, Bubs."
IRANDA	how was he?
STEVE	Good.
STEVE	a little cranky when he woke up.
IRANDA	Yeah?
STEVE	"So,"
STEVE	That was funny the other day.
IRANDA	"Yeah, It was fun."
IRANDA	"Wait, did you say it was fun or funny?"
STEVE	"I said funny, I think."
STEVE	But I guess I meant fun.
IRANDA	Debbie seems really nice.
STEVE	Thanks. I think so.
STEVE	So does Robert..
STEVE	is he Rob Or Robert?
IRANDA	Robert.
STEVE	"Yeah, He seems like a really good guy."
IRANDA	Yeah.
STEVE	Miranda.
ROBERT	"Hey, morning, Steve."
ROBERT	How's that nose.
ROBERT	You little guy.
STEVE	much better.
STEVE	I keep telling people that Debbie punched me.
STEVE	She loves that.
STEVE	"Well, then. I'm outta here."
ROBERT	Hey. Later.
BITSY VON MUFFLING	"Oh my god, Charlotte."
BITSY VON MUFFLING	Hey there. Hi there.
BITSY VON MUFFLING	Heather Greason told me she saw you at Dr. Mao's.
BITSY VON MUFFLING	"Didn't you love him? You feel like a pin cushion, I know,"
BITSY VON MUFFLING	but can't you feel it working?
CHARLOTTE	Sort of.
BITSY VON MUFFLING	"Well, do you know Isabelle Reed?"
BITSY VON MUFFLING	Horrible woman.
BITSY VON MUFFLING	But she's got a great story.
BITSY VON MUFFLING	"she tried everything, and I mean everything before she went to Dr. Mao's."
BITSY VON MUFFLING	"Anyway, she started going four times a week, taking the herbs."
BITSY VON MUFFLING	You have to take the herbs. Are you taking the herbs?
CARRIE	It turned out that Dr. Mao was a miracle worker.
CARRIE	"Because in just two short sessions,"
CARRIE	he taught Charlotte to block out all the New York noise she didn't need to hear.
CARRIE	Hey.
CARRIE	How long have you been up?
BIG	Just a few minutes.
CARRIE	How are you feeling?
BIG	Better.
BIG	I feel like myself again.
CARRIE	Let's see.
BIG	I'm fine. I'm fine.
BIG	Excuse me.
CARRIE	It was a shift imperceptible to anyone but me.
CARRIE	But I knew Big's heart had closed again.
CARRIE	"Maybe it would reopen in another five years, maybe it wouldn't."
CARRIE	But I knew myself well enough to know that that's not enough.
CARRIE	"Hey, I'm gonna order breakfast. What do you want?"
BIG	Just get me some cornflakes and juice.
BIG	Thanks.
CARRIE	"For the first time all week,"
CARRIE	I didn't feel like crying.
CARRIE	Life's too short.
CARRIE	Okay. Come on let's hurry.
CHARLOTTE	I'm not dressed to hustle.
CARRIE	Oh.
CARRIE	"When Charlotte and I heard that there was a woman in Chelsea not talking or eating,"
CARRIE	We were there in a New York minute.
CARRIE	And she's doing this for how long?
CHARLOTTE	16 days. 24 hours a day.
CHARLOTTE	This is Day 6.
CARRIE	It gets worse?
CHARLOTTE	"By changing my personal energy field,"
CHARLOTTE	I'm attempting to change the energy field in this room
CHARLOTTE	and perhaps that energy shift will shift the energy of the world.
CARRIE	Good for her. So Best-e's for lunch?
CHARLOTTE	"When I was working in the galleries,"
CHARLOTTE	performance art was more theatre then instillation.
CHARLOTTE	She's moved it to the next level.
CARRIE	Well girlfriend needs to move a comb through her hair.
CARRIE	She has company.
CARRIE	There's a man over there staring at me.
CHARLOTTE	Where?
CARRIE	Over there.
CARRIE	Oh.
CARRIE	He's not there.
CHARLOTTE	Can you tell Circe that Charlotte from Hisgallerian Spring Street sends her very best?
CARRIE	Okay that's him again.
CHARLOTTE	Oh my god.
CHARLOTTE	"That's Aleksandr Petrovsky, the artist."
CHARLOTTE	He is the --
ALEKSANDR	Thank you very much.
GALLERY STAFFER	Would you like..?
ALEKSANDR	No. it's okay.
CHARLOTTE	Oh excuse me. Mr. Petrovski.
ALEKSANDR	Yes?
CHARLOTTE	I don't mean to bother you but..
CHARLOTTE	I just have to say thank you.
CHARLOTTE	"When I first moved to New York and working in the galleries,"
CHARLOTTE	your Abstract #1 was my first important sale.
CHARLOTTE	This is such a thrill.
CHARLOTTE	I mean you defined the 70s in terms of progressive..
CHARLOTTE	And what did you think about this work today?
ALEKSANDR	Very moving. Significant.
ALEKSANDR	And what do you think?
CARRIE	Good.
ALEKSANDR	But you thought it was funny.
ALEKSANDR	I heard you laugh.
CARRIE	I'm not very arty.
ALEKSANDR	You don't think it's significant?
CARRIE	Oh please.
CARRIE	There are depressed women all over New York doing the exact same thing as her
CARRIE	and not calling it art.
CARRIE	"I mean, if you put a phone up on that platform,"
CARRIE	it's just a typical Friday night waiting for some guy to call.
CHARLOTTE	She's kidding.
CARRIE	"And frankly, I don't buy the whole 24 hours not eating thing."
CARRIE	"I bet if anyone bothered to come down here three in the morning,"
CARRIE	she wouldn't even be up there.
CARRIE	She'd be around the corner having a Big Mac.
CARRIE	Why do you think she has the life ladders?
CARRIE	To keep her from running out for a snack.
ALEKSANDR	And who are you?
CARRIE	What do you mean?
ALEKSANDR	Your name?
CARRIE	I'm Carrie Bradshaw.

CARRIE	Because?
IRANDA	"If it wasn't there, I wouldn't have to deal with it."

HARRY 	Doctor says it happens all the time.
CARRIE	How is she?
HARRY 	Not good.
HARRY 	She's just been sort of sitting and staring since this morning.
HARRY 	She didn't want me to call anybody but I thought..
CARRIE	"No, you did the right thing."
HARRY 	She's in the living room. I told her you were coming.
CARRIE	How are you?
HARRY 	You knowÂ¡Â¦
CARRIE	Hi. This is awful. I'm so sorry.
HARRY	The doctor said the good news is we got pregnant.
HARRY	He said lots of woman miscarry and go on to have perfectly healthy kids.
CARRIE	It's true. Shall I get you some mint tea?
CARRIE	How about that?
CHARLOTTE	I can't go to Brady's party on Saturday.
CARRIE	Okay. She'll understand.
ROBERT	Napkins. Cups. Party favors.
IRANDA	Done. Done. Done.
IRANDA	"Now on Saturday, all Steve has to do is bring the cake."
ROBERT	What kind?
IRANDA	Chocolates with white icing.
ROBERT	Baby's first sugar. Look out.
ROBERT	"You like chocolate, don't you?"
ROBERT	Well you haven't mentioned anything about the cookie.
IRANDA	You know what? Yes. I was.
IRANDA	If you give me a minute.
ROBERT	That's five days ago.
IRANDA	I'm embarrassed. I ate the whole thing.
IRANDA	It was delicious.
ROBERT	Good.
ROBERT	What about what it said?
IRANDA	Sweet. So sweet.
IRANDA	I love you Jules.
ROBERT	I love you Mimi.
TV SHOW	Loved you since I first saw you.
TV SHOW	Feel so right to finally say it.
TV SHOW	Don't have to hold the words back anymore.
TV SHOW	I love you Jules. I love you.
IRANDA	Hello.
IRANDA	I am so fucked up. I am so fucked up.
CARRIE	Okay we need to divide and conquer. What's going on?
IRANDA	I can't say I love you. I just can't.
IRANDA	It's not in my DNA.
IRANDA	"And everywhere I look, it is just flying out of people's mouths."
CARRIE	Who's mouths is it flying out of?
IRANDA	Everyone. Jules and Mimi.
CARRIE	They're fictional.
IRANDA	But they say it. Robert said it.
CARRIE	He said it on a cookie
IRANDA	I am so fucked up.
IRANDA	Robert asked about the cookie and it was the perfect time to say it and I couldn't.
IRANDA	He was just hanging there waiting and I couldn't.
IRANDA	I am never gonna be happy.
IRANDA	Just not gonna happen for me.
CARRIE	Do you love him?
IRANDA	How can I love him if I can't even say the words?
CARRIE	Well.
IRANDA	I always thought that when the right guy came along all of my bullshit will calm down
IRANDA	and go away and the words would just fall out of my mouth
IRANDA	because I would know he was the one.
IRANDA	And here he is.
IRANDA	The perfect guy. And I..
IRANDA	Is he the one? I don't know.
IRANDA	I don't know.
IRANDA	Because I am so fucked up.
IRANDA	And I am gonna ruin my life.
CARRIE	Stop. It's too late to ruin your life.
CARRIE	The only thing you're gonna ruin tonight is your night and mine.
CARRIE	I was kidding.
IRANDA	I'm laughing on the inside.
CARRIE	Okay listen. Get a good night sleep see how you feel tomorrow.
CARRIE	Turn off Jules and Mimi and go to bed.
CARRIE	You've seen enough love for one night.
IRANDA	You're right.
IRANDA	You know what used to make me feel better? Cookies...
CARRIE	good night.
IRANDA	Good night.
CARRIE	I blame Valentine's Day.
CARRIE	Hundreds upon hundreds of cards all decreeing you're the one.
CARRIE	Just imagine the hundreds and hundreds of wrenching late night phone calls
CARRIE	all over this one idea.
CARRIE	And it's not just with love.
CARRIE	It seems we're always looking for that one thing to make our lives complete.
CARRIE	"That job, that chance, that family."
CARRIE	"I couldn't help but wonder,"
CARRIE	when will waiting for the one be done?
CARRIE	Samantha was never a woman who looked for the one
CARRIE	"but today, she found one."
CARRIE	A gray one.
CARRIE	She figured a box in the hand was better than one in the bush.
CARRIE	"Turns out, left on too long, nice and simple was not so nice."

SAMANTHA	But there's something I should tell you.
CARRIE	There is one moment in every relationship
CARRIE	where you risk letting someone know the real you.
SAMANTHA	I'm a working woman and I don't have time for you to be down there searching for it.
SAMANTHA	So. I wanted to make everything nice and simple.
SAMANTHA	This was not that moment.
CARRIE	How long have you lived in New York?
ALEKSANDR	"Long time. Off and on. Paris, London."
ALEKSANDR	The other places. I like New York. It's honest.
CARRIE	Honest?
ALEKSANDR	There's no big smile on its face.
ALEKSANDR	"It's dark, painful. I like it."
CARRIE	Okay. You are way too Russian.
CARRIE	You get a girl out of bed to tell her you like pain?
CARRIE	It's two in the morning. Lighten up Bob.
CARRIE	Don't you know any jokes?

ALEKSANDR	I insist.
ALEKSANDR	Is that a banana in your purse
ALEKSANDR	Or are You Just very happy to see me?

CARRIE	Oh. Well. Thanks for dinner.
ALEKSANDR	You're welcome. I live right near here.
CARRIE	I thought you lived way downtown.
ALEKSANDR	That is near.
CARRIE	Well you can take the boy out of Studio54
CARRIE	but you can't take Studio54 out of the boy.
ALEKSANDR	You are funny. Light.
ALEKSANDR	"So. Not tonight, huh?"
CARRIE	And he tasted like black cherries.
CARRIE	A single gal spends most of her life searching for the perfect male.
CARRIE	"And out of the blue, it arrives."
CARRIE	Aleksandr Petrovsky was a rather famous artist with whom I had
CARRIE	one rather infamous date.
CARRIE	It's been three whole weeks.
CARRIE	I thought you died or something.
ALEKSANDR	I did die from dejection.
ALEKSANDR	How could you have left me on the street all alone.
ALEKSANDR	It still hurts.
CARRIE	You'll get over it.
CARRIE	You're a big boy.
ALEKSANDR	And where did you get this information?
ALEKSANDR	I was in Holland for work.
CARRIE	"Hmm, Holland??"
ALEKSANDR	Been there?
CARRIE	"To the land of the wooden shoes, no."
CARRIE	"No, no, no."
ALEKSANDR	I brought you a little present.
ALEKSANDR	Let's go.
ALEKSANDR	Milk chocolate?
ALEKSANDR	Or pehaps you like dark? I've got right here.
CARRIE	"You don't have a mouse trap in there, do you?"
ALEKSANDR	"No, why would I?"
CARRIE	I was being silly.
CARRIE	"You know, in the cartoons, when they put their hands and the thing.."
ALEKSANDR	Ok.
ALEKSANDR	Et voila.
ALEKSANDR	Light or dark?
CARRIE	"Second only to the search of the perfect male,"
CARRIE	is the search for the perfect fragrance.
CHARLOTTE	Am I peppermint musk?
CHARLOTTE	"Oh, no."
CARRIE	"Ladies, I'm taking a lover."
CARRIE	"Yes, a lover. Aleksandr Petrovsky."
IRANDA	"Wait, the old guy?"
CARRIE	I beg your pardon.
CARRIE	My lover is not old.
CARRIE	He is worldly and wise and very sexy.
CHARLOTTE	He is sexy.
CARRIE	Very.
CARRIE	Yesterday I almost did it with him on a park bench in front of children.
SAMANTHA	What stopped you?
CARRIE	Common decency.
SAMANTHA	Oh that.
CARRIE	"Well, that and the fact that I'm not lover ready."
CARRIE	I need a little bikini waxage.
SAMANTHA	"Well, then snap to it."
SAMANTHA	Don't play hard to get with a man who's hard to get.
CHARLOTTE	Maybe cucumber basil.
SAMANTHA	Why would you wanna smell like a salad?
CHARLOTTE	I can't decide what I am.
IRANDA	What do mean not old?
IRANDA	Charlotte e-mailed me his photo.
IRANDA	"Hello, sixty."
CARRIE	"He is in his lover perfect, early fifties."
SAMANTHA	That's a good age.
SAMANTHA	"They've been around the block, they know how to use their cock."
CARRIE	"Oh, you rhyme now."
CARRIE	And where did you get his picture?
CHARLOTTE	I googled him.
CHARLOTTE	I wanted Miranda to see your potential new boyfriend.
CARRIE	"Not boyfriend, lover."
IRANDA	How long are you going to keep saying in like that?
CARRIE	Uncomfortable with my taking a lover?
CHARLOTTE	Maybe he cold be more than a lover.
CARRIE	"Ah, no, the only place this is going is Loverville."
CHARLOTTE	"Well, I could see it going somewhere."
CARRIE	"Oh, please, half the time, I can't even understand him."
CARRIE	We have nothing in common.
CARRIE	He's in and out of Europe.
CHARLOTTE	That Could be Good.
SAMANTHA	"Honey, you're not listeing."
SAMANTHA	She only wants him to be in and out of her.
CARRIE	"Yes, but in a much less obvious sounding way."
CHARLOTTE	How about? petuli?
CARRIE	"No, you need something classic, clean."
IRANDA	But just a hint of neurosis.
CHARLOTTE	How about you?
CHARLOTTE	Are you finding anything?
IRANDA	I don't know.
IRANDA	I'm trying to figure out what Steve might like.
SAMANTHA	Just get some old spice and call it a day.
IRANDA	Steve does not wear old spice.
IRANDA	He wears nothing and he smells great.
CARRIE	"Oh, Miranda and Steve sitting in a tree K.I.S.S.I.N.G, first comes.."
CARRIE	"Well, actually first comes baby."
CARRIE	Oh great.
CARRIE	Now I have to spend the rest of the day smelling like..
IRANDA	Apples and hay.
CARRIE	You bastard.
CARRIE	"Ok, let's go."
CHARLOTTE	Aren't you going to get something for your new lover?
CARRIE	I suspect he already likes the way I smell.
IRANDA	Hey.
STEVE	How lucky are we?
IRANDA	Very.
CARRIE	"If Miranda and Steve had a fragrance,"
CARRIE	it would be called Perfection.
CARRIE	"If Miranda, Steve, and Robert, her ex and neighbor"
CARRIE	"had a fragrance, it wold be called Less Than Perfection."
CARRIE	"In fact, Awful, Uncomfortable, and Terrible."
IRANDA	Hi.
ROBERT	"Well, if it isn't the happy couple."
STEVE	How are you today.
ROBERT	Y'all have a nice day.
CHARLOTTE	So the doctor said that Harry and I have to wait at least two months before
CHARLOTTE	we even get try to get pregnant again.
CHARLOTTE	"And I like to back to work, but then if I do get pregnant, that's not really fair to the new"
CHARLOTTE	"employer, so I.."
ANTHONY	"I'm sleeping and walking,"
ANTHONY	"sleeping and walking, how am I doing that?"
CHARLOTTE	That's rude. This is important to me.
ANTHONY	"I know it's important to you, you know it's important to you,"
ANTHONY	the homeless guy on the corner of 57th and 7th knows it's important to you.
ANTHONY	Could we please talk about something else?
ANTHONY	I'll give a hundred dollars if you say something bitchy about someone we know.
CHARLOTTE	No.
CHARLOTTE	I'm trying to figure out my next direction and I need to talk about it.
ANTHONY	"Fine, Talk to my ears bleed."
ANTHONY	But do yourself a favor and stop for a minute and look at the light.
CHARLOTTE	"You mean the fact that no matter what happens with the baby, Harry and I will always have each other?"
ANTHONY	"No, Char, the frigging light over there in the park."
CHARLOTTE	When did it become fall?
ANTHONY	Somewhere between your ovaries and my boredom.
CHARLOTTE	Imagine.
CHARLOTTE	"Being blind, not being able to see a beautiful day like today."
CHARLOTTE	Can you think of anything worse?
ANTHONY	Stone washed jeans with a matching jacket.
CHARLOTTE	Maybe I should stop thnking so much about myself and volunteer for the blind or something.
ANTHONY	That would be a nice thing to do.
ANTHONY	Very Jacky-O
TECHNICIAN	"Ok, let me begin."
CARRIE	Can I ask you a question?
TECHNICIAN	"Yes, it will hurt a little."
CARRIE	"No, that's not the question."
CARRIE	Are you Russian?
TECHNICIAN	Yes.
TECHNICIAN	See. Hurt a little.
CARRIE	"Yes, I was wondering how do you say hello in Russian?"
TECHNICIAN	Zdravstvuite.
CARRIE	Zdravstvuite.
CARRIE	"And uh, how do you say thank you?"
TECHNICIAN	Spasibo.
CARRIE	Spasibo.
TECHNICIAN	You're welcome.
CARRIE	"The only thing more uncomfortable than a bikini wax,"
CARRIE	is an elevator ride with an ex.
CARRIE	"Luckily, Miranda had figured out a way to avoid that."
CARRIE	"Unfortunately, Robert had also."
ROBERT	"Robert, hi."
IRANDA	"Ok, I guess I deserve that."
IRANDA	Robert.
IRANDA	I'm sorry.
IRANDA	I've never meant to hurt you.
IRANDA	Steve and I just fell back in love.
ROBERT	Oh.
ROBERT	And so what was I to you? A little half time show?
IRANDA	What?
IRANDA	Not at all.
IRANDA	I never thought that Steve and I would
IRANDA	"get back together, or I never would have started up with you."
IRANDA	I hope you understand that.
ROBERT	"Well, I'll try."
ROBERT	And I hope you understand when you get my bill.
IRANDA	your bill?
ROBERT	"Yeah, my bill."
ROBERT	For services rendered.
ROBERT	"You know, my stud fee."
IRANDA	"Robert, come on."
ROBERT	"No, no, no, no. Hey, It's cool."
ROBERT	I got your singing.
ROBERT	"You're a busy working mother, too tired to go out and eat,"
ROBERT	"Hoonen Kitchen, too tired to go out and fuck, call Robert."
IRANDA	That's not true.
ROBERT	sure It is.
ROBERT	"Fastfood, Fast Fuck."
IRANDA	You were not a Fast Fuck.
ROBERT	"No, you're right, I wasn't."
ROBERT	I was slow. Nice and slow.
ROBERT	Just the way you liked it.
ROBERT	"Ooh, Robert, ooh, yes."
ROBERT	"Robert, oh god."
ROBERT	"Robert, ooh."
ROBERT	No man has ever been in this deep.
STEVE	"Hey, what are doing back?"
IRANDA	I gave Robert custody of the elevator.
STEVE	What?
STEVE	We're moving my stuff in here next week and you gave him the elevator?
IRANDA	You're lucky I didn't give him Brady.
IRANDA	I bumped into him on the stairs.
STEVE	How bad was it?
IRANDA	Hug me.
STEVE	"Oh, it's that bad, huh?"
STEVE	So we can't ever use the elevator?
IRANDA	Not between 8 a. m. and 10 p. m.
STEVE	we have a baby in a stroller.
IRANDA	I know.
IRANDA	"Why, why, why did I have to shit where I eat?"
STEVE	"Look, he's just upset, it'll blow over."
IRANDA	"I don't think so, Steve."
IRANDA	"The man is crazy in love with me and now he's acting out, talking about how"
IRANDA	I said no man's ever been in me that deep.
IRANDA	What?
STEVE	Nothing.
IRANDA	Steve.
STEVE	Nothing. Fine.
CARRIE	"Wednesday night, after dinner,"
CARRIE	I took the express elevator to Loverville.
CARRIE	Spasibo.
ALEKSANDR	"Oh, you speak Russian very well."
CARRIE	Spasibo.
ALEKSANDR	Is that the only word you know?
CARRIE	Zdravstvuite.
ALEKSANDR	"Yes, but is that the only word you know?"
ALEKSANDR	"There is my studio, and here's my house."
CARRIE	You have the entire floor?
ALEKSANDR	"Not at first, but over the years."
CARRIE	Spasibo. Zdravstvuite.
ALEKSANDR	"This used to be some kind of sewing factory, sweat shop in 1920s."
CARRIE	That's a lovely story.
CARRIE	"Very nice, if you like that whole window sky thing."
ALEKSANDR	"Yes, it's lovely light in the morning."
ALEKSANDR	Study and kitchen
ALEKSANDR	Would you like some fruit or martini or something?
CARRIE	Why don't you show me upstairs?
CARRIE	"My Russian may have been shaky,"
CARRIE	but I discovered I spoke lover very well.
CARRIE	"Turns out, I'd found a sweet bed and breafast in Loverville."
CARRIE	Good morning.
CARRIE	"Um, where?"
ALEKSANDR	"Morning. Come, come, sit."
CARRIE	"In the light of day, everything looked completely different."
ALEKSANDR	Would you like some coffee?
ALEKSANDR	What kind?
CARRIE	"Um, Regular."
ALEKSANDR	Regular coffee is for regular people.
ALEKSANDR	You are not regular.
CARRIE	I hope I'm not in the way.
ALEKSANDR	"What, what?"
ALEKSANDR	"No, no. It's Violet, Admar, Lee."
ALEKSANDR	"Hey, everybody, this is Carrie."
ALEKSANDR	It's my staff.
ALEKSANDR	Without them out I'd be sitting in the street with the sign
ALEKSANDR	I'll do art for food.
ALEKSANDR	"Speaking of food,"
ALEKSANDR	pancakes for the lady.
ALEKSANDR	You're hungry.
CARRIE	"But you, Aren't you gonna eat?"
ALEKSANDR	"No, I'm done."
ALEKSANDR	I'm off to Amsterdam remember?
CARRIE	"Oh, yeah. Right."
ALEKSANDR	"Maybe before I leave, I'll have one more little bite."
VIOLET	La voiture ne va pas attendre pour toujours.
ALEKSANDR	"Oui, oui, je pars toute de suite."
VIOLET	"Passeport, portefeuille, bien."
VIOLET	"Maintenant, sois poli avec M. Groge."
CARRIE	There I was having pancakes at IHOP
CARRIE	the international house of Petrovsky's.
CARRIE	And they just went on about their business totally unfazed.
SAMANTHA	"Oh, honey, they've seen it all."
SAMANTHA	"And you gotta give it to him,"
SAMANTHA	making pancakes for pussy.
SAMANTHA	That's a classy touch.
CARRIE	What?
SAMANTHA	You don't think you're the first babe he buttered up for.
CARRIE	"No, no, no, you're right."
CARRIE	You're right.
CARRIE	thewhole thing was so choreographed.
CARRIE	"No, he knew exactly what he was doing."
SAMANTHA	Sounds good to me.
SAMANTHA	I miss a man with the moves.
CARRIE	So Smith no moves.
SAMANTHA	"No, he has them, most of them I've given him, but he has them."
SAMANTHA	Truth time.
SAMANTHA	I'm a little jealous.
CARRIE	Of what?
CARRIE	My grand slam breakfast?
CARRIE	"You've got yourself a man, a real powerplayer."
SAMANTHA	"Someone who takes charge, drags you to the bed,"
SAMANTHA	"has his way with you, doesn't have to ask what you want,"
SAMANTHA	and fucks you and fucks you.
CARRIE	"We're not talking about me anymore, are we?"
SAMANTHA	"No, I mean, Smith, he's hot but he's a baby."
CARRIE	He's almost thirty.
SAMANTHA	"Still, I swear sometimes I don't know whether to blow him or burp him."
SAMANTHA	I need a grown-up.
SAMANTHA	"So, uh, how were they?"
CARRIE	The pancakes?
CARRIE	"Delicious, exactly what I wanted, I couldn't get enough."
SAMANTHA	"No, I was referring to the moves."
CARRIE	"Oh, delicious, exactly what I wanted, I couldn't get enough."
SAMANTHA	Good for you.
CARRIE	"So, how many pancakes do you think that kitchen has seen?"
SAMANTHA	Does it matter?
CARRIE	"In the cold, harsh reality of daylight,"
CARRIE	I knew it didn't matter.
CARRIE	"But in the colder, harsher reality of a woman"
CARRIE	"who just slept with someone she likes, it did."
CARRIE	Google dot com showed many many listings
CARRIE	"on the art of Aleksandr Petrovsky, and one"
CARRIE	on his many many women.
CARRIE	"According to certain scientists, whenever a woman"
CARRIE	"has sex, her body produces a chemical which"
CARRIE	causes her to emotionally attach.
CARRIE	This chemical may also account for the series of
CARRIE	terrifying questions that involuntarily pop into
CARRIE	our minds after just one casual tryst.
CARRIE	"Questions like does he like me, will he call again,"
CARRIE	"and the classic, where is this all going?"
CARRIE	"When it comes to the men, even when we try to"
CARRIE	"keep it light, how do we wind up in the dark?"
SMITH	"Hey, I've got this invite to a party Teen Posse's throwing."
SMITH	Top thirty under thirty.
SMITH	I'm one of them.
SAMANTHA	Hah.
SMITH	You wanna go?
SAMANTHA	"Teen Posse and me, no. And no."
SMITH	"Well, my agent and my manager really want me to go."
SMITH	At least look at the invite and tell me how lame it is.
CARRIE	The party may have been all wrong but it was being hosted by Richard.
SMITH	What?
SMITH	Lame ass?
SAMANTHA	"No, not so lame ass."
SAMANTHA	Richard is a big name in the hotel business.
SAMANTHA	He brings a certain something.
CARRIE	And it was exactly the certain something that Samantha was missing.
SAMANTHA	You should go.
SAMANTHA	"In fact, I'll go with you."
SAMANTHA	What the hell.
SMITH	Cool.
CHARLOTTE	And I'm not relly allowed to try and pregnant again for another two months.
COORDINATOR	So you said.
CHARLOTTE	And I thought I have all this time on my hands to volunteer.
COORDINATOR	"Ok, working as a guide for visually impaired person is a serious undertaking."
COORDINATOR	We suggest allour potential volunteers go to a public place like a park or a department store
COORDINATOR	with a friend and let him or her lead your around blindfolded.
CHARLOTTE	Blindfolded?
COORDINATOR	"Yeah, try not to take the blindfold off no matter how uncomfortable you feel"
COORDINATOR	and you'll begin to get a sense of what it's like not to be able to rely on your sight.
COORDINATOR	"Ok, bye."
CARRIE	I mean where can this possibly go?
CHARLOTTE	I thought you didn't want it to go anywhere.
CARRIE	"Well, that was before I slept with him, now, not so sure."
CHARLOTTE	Interesting.
CARRIE	"No, ridiculous, and according to my new best friend google dot com,.."
CHARLOTTE	You googled him.
CARRIE	"The man has dated every woman in New York from 1977 until, well, until last Wednesday."
CARRIE	And who knows how many pancakes he's making for other ridiculous women around the world.
CARRIE	"Oh god, listen to me, and I've only slept with him once."
CARRIE	"Ok, let's get blind."
CHARLOTTE	"So once I put this over my eyes, I can't take it off."
CHARLOTTE	I need you to guide me.
CARRIE	I'm there.
CHARLOTTE	This is embarrassing.
CARRIE	"No, thinking you can take a lover is embarrassing."
CARRIE	This is helping people.
CHARLOTTE	How's my hair?
CARRIE	"Oh, that's European code, it's him."
CARRIE	Should I answer it?
CARRIE	Ok.
CARRIE	Hello
ALEKSANDR	"Carrie, it's Aleks."
CARRIE	Hi. How's Amsterdam.
ALEKSANDR	It's very Dutch
CARRIE	What?
CARRIE	"I can, I can't hear you."
CARRIE	"Oh you know what, I need better reception."
CARRIE	I'm gonna go right over there.
CARRIE	Don't go away.
CHARLOTTE	Ok.
CARRIE	Hi.
CHARLOTTE	"Oh, I'm sorry."
CARRIE	Tomorrow night?
ALEKSANDR	Yes.
CARRIE	What?
ALEKSANDR	the reception is very bad.
CARRIE	"bad reception, Yes."
ALEKSANDR	"Tomorrow, are You free?"
CARRIE	"Yes, I'm free."
ALEKSANDR	Sorry I can't hear you.
CARRIE	I'm free.
ALEKSANDR	"Ok, tomorrow at 9."
CARRIE	"Yes, I will be there."
ALEKSANDR	"Carrie, Carrie?"
CARRIE	Hello?
CARRIE	Sweetie?
PURFUME WORKER	Would like the sample in the air?
STORE REP	do You need some assisstance?
CHARLOTTE	"No, Thank you."
CHARLOTTE	I'm trying to help the blind.
CHARLOTTE	"I just got separated from my friend, but I'm sure she'll find me."
PURFUME WORKER	Lumiere?
CHARLOTTE	"Oh, No, bad, bad."
CHARLOTTE	"Oh, Excuse me. Sorry."
CARRIE	"And there in the dark, Charlotte realized"
CARRIE	she had no idea where she was going in
CARRIE	Barney's or in real life.
CARRIE	"but sometimes, even if you're not sure of your"
CARRIE	"direction, you can find your way to something wonderful."
CARRIE	Don't they have these over there in the..
CARRIE	I swear I looked and looked and then I thought best if she finds me.
CARRIE	"I'm meeting him tomorrow, cute, huh?"
CHARLOTTE	Oh yeah.
CARRIE	"Ok, ok."
SAMANTHA	"Let's just go in front of the line, like I suggested."
SMITH	I don't like pushing in front of people.
SAMANTHA	"Oh, grow up."
SAMANTHA	"Smith, we're on the list."
HOST	"Oh my god, owesome."
HOST	Love your hair.
HOST	Let me just check you off.
HOST	And you are?
RICHARD	Samantha Jones.
RICHARD	Aren't you a sight for sore eyes.
SMITH	"Um, dude."
SAMANTHA	He's with me.
RICHARD	"Oh, I'm sorry, Richard."
SMITH	Smith.
RICHARD	"Let's get some drinks, shall we?"
RICHARD	"So, how long have you been babysitting?"
SAMANTHA	Said the man who's hosting a Teen Posse party.
RICHARD	Don't rub it in.
RICHARD	The hotels have to stay hip.
RICHARD	So I have to bend over backwards.
RICHARD	of these trendy little pissass.
SAMANTHA	"Well, you look good."
RICHARD	"That's 'cause I'm looking at you, gorgeous."
RICHARD	Two more scotch rocks.
SMITH	What's up?
RICHARD	Can I get you a scotch?
SMITH	"No thank, man, I'm an AA."
RICHARD	You kids today.
SMITH	So how do you two know each other?
SAMANTHA	We used to go out.
RICHARD	And then I fucked it up royally and lost the best thing I ever had.
GIRL	"Oh my god, Smith, you have to come."
GIRL	Paulie is snorting pretzel out of his nose.
GIRL 2	You have to come. It's fucking hilarious.
GIRLS	come on. Paulie. do It again.
RICHARD	Paulie is snorting pretzels out his nose.
SAMANTHA	Fuck you.
STEVE	"Okay, this is the last load."
IRANDA	"For a guy with no stuff, you've got stuff."
STEVE	Let's get the TV first.
STEVE	What the fuck?
STEVE	That wasn't like that when we moved it in here.
IRANDA	Oh my god.
IRANDA	Robert.
STEVE	what?
STEVE	"Nah, you think?"
IRANDA	"Um hello, he's mad, your name is on the boxes,"
IRANDA	he lives in the building.
STEVE	"Nah, it doesn't seem like him, I musta bumped it or something."
IRANDA	"Steve, he's crazy in love with me."
IRANDA	You didn't see how angry he was on the stairs.
STEVE	"Ok, this is bullshit."
STEVE	I'm not gonna live like this.
IRANDA	What are you gonna do?
STEVE	I'm gonna take care of things.
IRANDA	Be kind.
IRANDA	He's still in love with me.
IRANDA	Steve?
STEVE	"Look, I need to talk to you about this whole Miranda thing."
ROBERT	What about her?
ROBERT	"I'll be right back, baby."
CARRIE	Turns out Petrovsky wasn't the only one with the international house.
STEVE	We're sorry.
STEVE	She's sorry.
STEVE	I'm sorry.
STEVE	We're sorry.
ROBERT	I appreciate that.
IRANDA	What happened?
STEVE	Let's just put it this way.
STEVE	He won't be bothering us again.
IRANDA	Was he very upset?
CARRIE	"When it came to Robert,"
CARRIE	Steve thought it was kinder to leave Miranda in the dark.
SMITH	Samantha.
SMITH	"Hey, where are you going, babe?"
SAMANTHA	Richard wanted to show me one of his remodelled suites.
SMITH	"Cool, can I come?"
SAMANTHA	No.
SAMANTHA	"No, Smith, you can't come."
SAMANTHA	"Look, this was fun, but where is it going?"
RICHARD	Gorgeous?
SAMANTHA	You go play with your friends and I'll go play woth mine.
SMITH	Samantha.
RICHARD	"Two years ago, I was on top of the fucking world."
RICHARD	Now I'm hosting a bullshit beer-bash for a bunch of pinheads with six pack abs.
RICHARD	This is a world class hotel.
RICHARD	Fuck it. I've been down this low before.
CARRIE	"Richard may have, but Samantha haven't."
SMITH	I just wanted to make sure you got home safe.
SAMANTHA	I don't know what's wrong with me.
SAMANTHA	I hate myself for doing this to you.
SMITH	Oh god.
SMITH	"It's ok, it's okay."
SMITH	Come on.
SMITH	Let's get you out of here.
CARRIE	"Even in the dark, Smith could still see Samantha."
CARRIE	"And for the very first time, she saw him."
ALEKSANDR	"I have some work to do in my studio,"
ALEKSANDR	"but you're welcome to stay, ok?"
CARRIE	It was at that moment I realized I wasn't really comfortable in Loverville.
CARRIE	I'm not that kind of google.
ALEKSANDR	Hi.
CARRIE	I just wanted to say thank you.
CARRIE	I'm gonna go.
ALEKSANDR	"Ok, then I'll call you tomorrow, all right?"
CARRIE	Um.
CARRIE	This has been really lovely but I don't think I'm cut out for it.
ALEKSANDR	I don't understand.
CARRIE	"The pancakes and the other ladies,"
CARRIE	it's just not for me.
CARRIE	There are pancakes but no other ladies.
ALEKSANDR	"Well, I have a book with a few emergency telephone numbers, yes."
ALEKSANDR	But now I just see you.
ALEKSANDR	"This is not about great bang, this.."
ALEKSANDR	I just like you.
CARRIE	Why me?
ALEKSANDR	Why me?
CARRIE	You make a good breakfast.
ALEKSANDR	So what's all this?
CARRIE	It's too soon to tell.
CARRIE	"In autumn, New Yorkers treat every nice day as if it could be their last."
IRANDA	I'd have another? what do you say?
STEVE	You're a bad influence.
OLD WOMAN	I waited and waited. You said to meet you at the subway.
OLD MAN	I was at the subway. I was at the foot of the stairs.
OLD MAN	You were at the subway? You was in the subway.
OLD WOMAN	Oh you don't know how to give directions! I waited threeÂ¡Â¦
STEVE	It's gonna be us in thirty years.
IRANDA	Please don't say that.
STEVE	I'm kidding. That could never be us.
IRANDA	"That already was us, remember?"
STEVE	Yeah but that was then.
IRANDA	"So for the future, I don't wanna become that."
STEVE	Okay. I don't want you to worry about becoming that.
IRANDA	Okay. I won't.
IRANDA	Anything else we don't want?
STEVE	Yeah. I don't want you paying for these beers.
STEVE	I'm serious. Your turn.
IRANDA	Okay.
IRANDA	I don't wanna become your mother.
STEVE	That's good.
STEVE	I don't wanna slack off like I used to.
IRANDA	I don't wanna be so moody. This is fun.
STEVE	I don't wanna lose you again.
STEVE	"Even if I screw up all the other stuff, that's the one that matters."
IRANDA	I don't wanna lose you either.
IRANDA	Will you marry me?
STEVE	Are you serious?
IRANDA	Yes. Will you?
STEVE	Hell yeah.
CARRIE	Some couples have to say their I don'ts before they can ever imagine saying their I dos.
CARRIE	"80 blocks and a world away,"
CARRIE	I was enjoying a different kind of happy hour at Aleksandr Patrovsky's.
CARRIE	That's pretty. What is that?
ALEKSANDR	It's a little tune I've made up for you.
CARRIE	What? No you didn't.
ALEKSANDR	Yes I did.
ALEKSANDR	La femme avec les yeux lumineux.
ALEKSANDR	"Which means a woman with a luminous, shining, sparkling eyes."
IRANDA	That is the cheesiest thing I have ever heard in my life. Ick!
CARRIE	I know. I can't even look at you all right now.
CARRIE	I'm so embarrassed.
CHARLOTTE	It all sounds very old world to me.
CHARLOTTE	Very 18th century Russia.
CARRIE	Yes and I live in New York City Circa now.
CARRIE	I think it's romantic if someone offers me a sit on the subway.
IRANDA	That is romantic.
CHARLOTTE	We are just starved for real romance and that is the sad truth.
SAMANTHA	I'm not starved. Smith is in LA for the week
SAMANTHA	and he calls me every night before he goes to sleep.
CARRIE	Phone sex does not count.
SAMANTHA	I'm drinking a glass of wine while we do it.
CHARLOTTE	I wanna hear more about the romance. What else? What else did he do?
CARRIE	"Well. There was one more thing but if you I tell you,"
CARRIE	it will be the ick heard around the world.
CHARLOTTE	It will not.
CARRIE	You know the song that he wrote for me?
IRANDA	Yeah. Ick.
CARRIE	"Well, it had a name."
CARRIE	La femme avec les yeux lumineux.
CHARLOTTE	The woman with eyes that Sparkle?
SAMANTHA	What's French for ick?
IRANDA	EEEck.
CARRIE	"And I swear to you while he was playing it, I floated up out of my body"
CARRIE	and I was on the ceiling looking down at myself thinkingÂ¡Â¦
CARRIE	come on!'
CHARLOTTE	He was just expressing genuine emotion in an old fashioned way.
IRANDA	But it's not genuine. It's pure show.
IRANDA	I can't stand all that artificial hoo-hah.
IRANDA	That's why I proposed to Steve over $3 beers.
CHARLOTTE	You proposed?
SAMANTHA	You proposed marriage?
IRANDA	Okay. Everybody stop. It's not a big deal.
IRANDA	I'm not engaged.
IRANDA	I'm not doing the big circus wedding.
IRANDA	There will be no white dress or bridesmaids or posed pictures.
IRANDA	I hate all that shit.
CHARLOTTE	Well that's your choice. Every bride has to find her own style.
SAMANTHA	When is it gonna be?
IRANDA	Soon as I can find some place that doesn't make me hurl.
IRANDA	"It's just gonna be a simple, nothing thing."
IRANDA	I don't even care about the wedding.
IRANDA	I just wanna be with Steve.
CHARLOTTE	Oh. Miranda.
IRANDA	Okay. This is exactly what I don't want.
IRANDA	No tears.
CARRIE	Oh my god.
SAMANTHA	I can't believe it.
IRANDA	That's it. You're all freaking me out.
IRANDA	"Samantha, I expected more from you."
CHARLOTTE	He just felt inspired to write her a song and then he played it for her.
CHARLOTTE	Isn't that the most romantic thing you've ever heard?
HARRY	Yeah. Not bad.
HARRY	I used to play clarinet when I was little.
CHARLOTTE	This is so good. You have to have some.
CHARLOTTE	Doesn't that taste like real butter pecan?
HARRY	"Okay. If that's what we're playing, sure."
HARRY	I can pretend it's whipped flavored air's the real thing. Yum.
CHARLOTTE	I mean it's something out of the Victorian novel.
CHARLOTTE	People just don't do those things anymore.
HARRY	"Hey I can be romantic too, you know."
CHARLOTTE	Oh honey I know you can.
CHARLOTTE	I think it's romantic that you walk me to the Tasti-Eelight every night.
HARRY	Don't humor me.
HARRY	I know how to do romance right. It's not just for foo foo foreigners.
HARRY	"In fact, I am gonna take you out for a real romantic night on the town."
HARRY	Wining and dining baby.
CHARLOTTE	Really?
HARRY	You bet. Let me get another lick of that.
IRANDA	I don't wanna make a big entrance. I don't want everyone staring at me.
CARRIE	And from looking to loving.
IRANDA	I just wanted to be like us. Like...
IRANDA	not like one of those millions cookie cutter weddings I had to suffer through.
IRANDA	How do we do that?
STEVE	What about one of those boat rides that goes all around the island? That's different.
IRANDA	"We're not boat people. When have we ever been on a boat together, ever?"
STEVE	Okay. You got a better idea?
IRANDA	shit.
STEVE	"Oh, shit."
IRANDA	This is so us. We are pathetic.
STEVE	This gum is like super glue. Look at this.
IRANDA	"You see? We're bad people, not boat people."
IRANDA	We should get married right here in this mess.
STEVE	We're gonna have to if I can't get this gum off.
IRANDA	Hey.
IRANDA	That's a nice garden.
STEVE	Yeah. It's pretty.
IRANDA	But not corny.
STEVE	What do you think?
IRANDA	I don't hate it.
CARRIE	The only thing harder than choosing a spot for a wedding when you hate weddings
CHARLOTTE	What about a guestbook?
CARRIE	Is choosing a wedding gift for a friend who hates weddings.
CHARLOTTE	"Sweetie, there's gonna be like 8 of us there. There's no one to keep track of."
CARRIE	Can't believe Miranda's getting married.
SAMANTHA	I know.
CHARLOTTE	this is pretty.
SAMANTHA	She'll hate that. Too domestic.
CARRIE	And too bridy.
SAMANTHA	Yeah. Let's try not to piss her off.
CHARLOTTE	Well maybe we should just buy her a stapler and wrap it in brown paper
CHARLOTTE	and just smear just dog poo on it.
CHARLOTTE	You think she'd be comfortable with that?
CARRIE	Fine. We'll get the dish.
SAMANTHA	Ladies. I have something to tell you.
SAMANTHA	And you're not going to like it.
CARRIE	"If you get married and leave me all alone, I will kill you."
SAMANTHA	As you know I have always loved my body just the way it is.
SAMANTHA	"My legs are fantastic, I have killer abs."
SAMANTHA	My ass is perfection.
CARRIE	Is this the part we're not gonna like?
SAMANTHA	But I have decided after careful consideration
SAMANTHA	that I might be ready for bigger boobs.
CARRIE	Since when?
SAMANTHA	Since I had a cold hard dose of reality.
SAMANTHA	From this. Look.
CHARLOTTE	You're in 'In Touch' magazine?
CARRIE	And that's your source of reality?
SAMANTHA	Yes. They named Smith Jarred the number one hot guy to watch.
SAMANTHA	They followed him all over town for a week.
SAMANTHA	I'm in half the pictures. See.
SAMANTHA	There are my boobs on Wednesday. See how small they are?
SAMANTHA	There they are again on Thursday. Teeny tiny.
SAMANTHA	And there they are having lunch. You can barely see them.
SAMANTHA	I should have bought my loop.
CHARLOTTE	I can't believe you would actually consider having a boob job.
CARRIE	I can't believe you went to Planet Hollywood.
CHARLOTTE	You are a confident intelligent woman.
CHARLOTTE	Why would you wanna look like a bimbo.
SAMANTHA	I wouldn't be getting the watermelon freak show kind.
SAMANTHA	I'd get something tasteful. Something like...
SAMANTHA	yours. yours are Good.
CARRIE	mine?
CHARLOTTE	What's wrong with mine?
SAMANTHA	They're not bad either. Let's see.
CHARLOTTE	Okay. All right. Get hers.
CARRIE	No.
CARRIE	A few days later the rain came.
ALEKSANDR	Listen if you like this poem.
CARRIE	Poem?
CARRIE	And so did the poetry.
ALEKSANDR	So long had life together been that once the snow began to fall
ALEKSANDR	it seemed an ending
ALEKSANDR	that leads to flakes should make her eye lids wince.
ALEKSANDR	I chilled them with my hand and
ALEKSANDR	they pretending not to believe that cherishing of eyes would beat
ALEKSANDR	against my palm like butterflies.
CARRIE	That is some serious stuff.
ALEKSANDR	"Had enough, huh?"
CARRIE	No. It's beautiful.
CARRIE	How about I read you a little bit of my favorite poetry?
ALEKSANDR	Please.
CARRIE	Cocktails at Tiffany's calls for classic charm.
CARRIE	Oscar De la renta sleeveless silk five.
CARRIE	Full skirted dress with black-patented leather bow belt.
CARRIE	Now that is pure poetry.
ALEKSANDR	Oscar's a good friend of mine.
ALEKSANDR	I'll tell him you like the dress.
CARRIE	Oscar? You call him Oscar?
ALEKSANDR	"It's his name, isn't it?"
ALEKSANDR	So you feel uncomfortable with the poetry.
ALEKSANDR	Why is that?
CARRIE	Look. I'm sorry. Perhaps we were not properly introduced.
CARRIE	I write a column based on the assumption that romance is either dead or just phony.
ALEKSANDR	You think I'm phony?
CARRIE	No. Not at all. I'm the one that feels like a phony.
CARRIE	"Frankly, I'm just not used to these grand gestures."
ALEKSANDR	"You mean no other man, no one write you a little poem"
ALEKSANDR	or played a little music for you?
CARRIE	No. No they have not.
ALEKSANDR	Wow.
ALEKSANDR	Okay.
CARRIE	I'm in over my head. Where are you?
IRANDA	Shopping for my wedding dress on my lunch hour.
IRANDA	"I said no white, no ivory."
IRANDA	No nothing that says virgin.
IRANDA	I have a child. The jig is up.
CARRIE	So. Yesterday the Russian read me a Russian poem.
CARRIE	"But You know, in English."
IRANDA	are You Just Making this stuff up now?
CARRIE	No. And this might sound crazy but I don't think it's an act.
CARRIE	I think he actually means it.
IRANDA	That doesn't make it okay.
IRANDA	Has he considered your feelings?
CARRIE	You're right. He's a selfish pig.
IRANDA	I'm serious. I think you should tell him this whole romance thing gives you the icks.
IRANDA	"Turns your stomach and that he's dating you, not Anna Karenina."
CARRIE	Okay I'll tell him that. I can't tell him that.
CARRIE	"And let me ask you something. If you're so anti-romance,"
CARRIE	why are you having a wedding at all? Why not just go down to city hall
CARRIE	and get it over with?
IRANDA	"You know, I thought about that."
IRANDA	But then I realized I actually do wanna say those vows out loud to Steve
IRANDA	in front of the people I care about.
IRANDA	Are you gagging over there?
CARRIE	No. The opposite.
CARRIE	"My god Miranda, you're my cynical touchstone."
CARRIE	Do you promise to still be cynical even after you're married?
IRANDA	I do. I have got to go.
IRANDA	There's a big pile of tutus coming at me.
IRANDA	Okay. We need to have another talk.
CARRIE	One of the great things about living in New York City
CARRIE	is that you don't have to sugar coat your feelings.
CARRIE	But have New York women settled for a sugar free existence as well?
CARRIE	We accept Tasti-Delight instead of real ice cream.
CARRIE	E-mails instead of love songs.
CARRIE	Jokes instead of poetry.
CARRIE	"It's no wonder that faced with the real thing,"
CARRIE	we can't stomach it.
CARRIE	Is it something we could learn to digest or
CARRIE	have we become romance intolerant?
HARRY	"Et puis pour la troisieme course, we would like the foie gras,"
HARRY	"followed by the ""boeuf"" bourgignon avec la legume a la creme."
CARRIE	it was Harry's version of a serenade.
CARRIE	And Charlotte ate it right up.
HARRY	"Et en fin, le plat du fromage."
WAITER	The plate or the cart? We have a lovely cheese cart.
HARRY	Mais oui. Bring us the cart.
HARRY	Tuit suit for my sweetie.
CHARLOTTE	I had no idea you could speak French so well honey.
HARRY	The French learn romance from me baby.
CARRIE	"Downtown, in the name of boob job research,"
CARRIE	Samantha decided to go where the biggest crop will be on display.
DUDES	"Woo, nice!"
CARRIE	"Some were little boobs,"
DUDES	That's not bad.
CARRIE	"some were big boobs,"
CARRIE	some were ridiculously big boobs.
DUDES	"Oh, boy."
DUDES	Okay that's my wife right there.
CARRIE	And then there were the two biggest boobs of all. Right beside her.
WAITRESS	Can I get you something?
SAMANTHA	You either have the most naturally beautiful breasts I've ever seen
SAMANTHA	or I need the name of your doctor.
WAITRESS	You want doctor Bevel. He's the best.
WAITRESS	They paid for themselves in tips alone.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, back in the 18th century,"
CARRIE	Oh. I'm sorry. Is this a formal sleepover?
ALEKSANDR	Actually there's an opening at the Met tonight.
ALEKSANDR	It's La Traviata. And you're going with me.
CARRIE	"Man, I was this close to throwing on my ball gown but I ignored my instincts."
CARRIE	"All right, I'll go home and change."
ALEKSANDR	No. You'll be much faster.
ALEKSANDR	Come in.
ALEKSANDR	"Come on, Open it."
ALEKSANDR	"Tonight only your poetry, not mine."
ALEKSANDR	From the magazine. You like it?
CARRIE	"If I had been on a romance free diet, this seemed like a good time to binge."
CHARLOTTE	"That was the most romantic, elegant."
HARRY	Pardon me. That was weird.
CHARLOTTE	"Decadent, 7 course."
HARRY	I'm sorry honey.
HARRY	Oh boy.
CHARLOTTE	Are you okay?
CHARLOTTE	Honey.
CHARLOTTE	Are you gonna be long in there?
HARRY	Maybe. Oh definitely. Why?
CHARLOTTE	That's okay. I'll go to the other one.
CARRIE	"When you splurge on romantic 7 course meal,"
CARRIE	you generally want to remember every bite.
CARRIE	"There was the soup course, the dessert course,"
CARRIE	and all the other yummy courses in between.
HARRY	That's gotta be it. I'm done.
CARRIE	Harry and Charlotte had romance shooting out of them every 20 minutes.
CHARLOTTE	Oh I'm not.
CARRIE	For the rest of the night.
HARRY	Wouldn't go in there if I were you. It's not pleasant.
CHARLOTTE	I can't make it to the other one.
HARRY	It's the fucking fromage.
CHARLOTTE	No.
HARRY	That fucking fromage.
HARRY	Look out. I'm coming in.
CARRIE	Surviving a night of food poisoning together wasn't the stuff of great romance
CARRIE	but it was the stuff of lasting love.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, a funny thing happened on the way to the opera."
ALEKSANDR	"Wait, wait."
ALEKSANDR	This music. This place.
ALEKSANDR	You.
ALEKSANDR	Isn't it perfect?
ALEKSANDR	Will you dance with me?
CARRIE	It was the most romantic moment.
ALEKSANDR	"Hey. Hey, Hey, Hey. are You okay?"
BYSTANDER	is she All right?
ALEKSANDR	You okay?
CARRIE	No. It's too much. I'm an American.
CARRIE	You gotta take it down a nudge.
BYSTANDER	she need Any help?
CARRIE	"No, he's got it."
ALEKSANDR	And then a quarter a pound of cheese.
ALEKSANDR	McNuggets.
CDONALDS WORKER	Would you like to super size that?
ALEKSANDR	can You handle it?
CARRIE	Absolutely.
ALEKSANDR	Absolutely.
CARRIE	I'm sorry about the opera.
ALEKSANDR	Don't be silly. Other time. Other dress.
CARRIE	May I offer you a fry?
CARRIE	They're French.
ALEKSANDR	"Oh, then."
CARRIE	Okay. I think I might be up for a quick spin now.
CARRIE	If you'll still have me.
ALEKSANDR	Of course.
CDONALDS WORKER	That'll be $9.54.
CARRIE	"And there beneath the florescent moonlight,"
CARRIE	I was finally laughing with romance and not at it.
SAMANTHA	"And if I went any bigger than this,"
SAMANTHA	"I think I'd look ridiculous, don't you?"
DR. BEVEL	"Well, that's not my work. But I did hers."
DR. BEVEL	And hers right before the golden globes.
SAMANTHA	"Wow, they're winners."
SAMANTHA	Other arm please.
SAMANTHA	I have an event in two months that I'd really like to have a little cleavage for.
SAMANTHA	Will they be up and running by then?
DR. BEVEL	"Ms Jones, you have a little lump I'd like you to have checked out before we begin our work."
DR. BEVEL	"It's right here, you can feel it yourself."
SAMANTHA	Are you kidding?
DR. BEVEL	"No, I'm afraid not."
SAMANTHA	"Okay. But it's not serious, right?"
DR. BEVEL	"Well, it's probably just a cyst but we wanna be absolutely sure."
DR. BEVEL	"I'd like you to have it looked out, as soon as possible, okay?"
CARRIE	"By Miranda's wedding day, I felt the whole world have gone romantic"
CARRIE	when Samantha insisted on picking me up in a cab.
CARRIE	What has come over you? This is a hundred block out of your way.
SAMANTHA	Now we're going to 10th and 6th avenue please.
CARRIE	boy You look nice.
SAMANTHA	So do you.
CARRIE	Thank you.
SAMANTHA	So I had my breast consultation with a plastic sergeant.
CARRIE	Please tell me you've changed your mind.
SAMANTHA	Well not exactly. He found a lump.
SAMANTHA	"And I had it biopsy-ed, and it turns out I have cancer."
CARRIE	You what? When?
SAMANTHA	Well I had it biopsy-ed on Wednesday and I found out yesterday.
SAMANTHA	I'm going to give you all the information and I don't want you to get upset
SAMANTHA	or start worrying and the only reason I'm telling you now and not later
SAMANTHA	is I didn't want to accidentally blurt out
SAMANTHA	I have cancer' in the middle of Miranda's wedding.
SAMANTHA	Could you please take 5th? Broadway's a disaster.
CARRIE	Okay. I'm listening.
SAMANTHA	And please don't tell Charlotte and Miranda.
SAMANTHA	I don't want to ruin their days too.
CARRIE	"Of course, whatever you say."
CARRIE	So. What exactly do you know?
SAMANTHA	Just that there are cancer cells and I had a monogram and they think
SAMANTHA	it's small which is a good sign.
SAMANTHA	And I won't know anything else until they take the fucker out next week.
SAMANTHA	"So there, now you know everything and we can talk about something else."
SAMANTHA	So do you like my skunk?
CARRIE	"Well, thank you for telling me."
SAMANTHA	Sure.
SAMANTHA	I'm sorry to put a big cloud over the whole day.
CARRIE	Samantha.
SAMANTHA	I know I'm gonna be fine. I know that.
SAMANTHA	It's just..
SAMANTHA	I don't wanna lose my breasts.
SAMANTHA	They're fabulous.
SAMANTHA	they are.

CARRIE	The one wedding ritual Miranda never had a problem with was the part
CARRIE	where everyone eats and so we did.
CHARLOTTE	"Samantha, you look so pretty today."
SAMANTHA	Thanks. I have cancer.
CHARLOTTE	what?
WAITER	are You All Okay with drinks?

IRANDA	Thank you.
ARY	I admire you for not pretending.
ARY	So we're family now and there's something private I wanna tell you.
IRANDA	Oh you don't have to.
ARY	"The day I married Steve's father,"
ARY	I wore white.
ARY	But I shouldn't have. I slipped.
ARY	Once. God forgive me. Don't tell Steve.
ARY	"When I walked down that ail at St. Agnus,"
ARY	I had a white dress on the outside and my little Jackie on the inside.
IRANDA	Steve?

IRANDA	Oh my god. I am legally bound to Steve's mother.
CARRIE	Hi.
SAMANTHA	Congratulations.
IRANDA	What? Why are you being weird?
CHARLOTTE	We're not being weird.
CARRIE	"No, we're just talking."
IRANDA	"About me, right?"
IRANDA	"You think I'm an asshole, that I've become one of them."
IRANDA	That I'm a Stepford bride.
GROUP	no.
IRANDA	Then tell me what you were talking about.
SAMANTHA	I'll tell you tomorrow. I don't wanna ruin your special day.
IRANDA	"Forget about my special fucking day and be normal, please. I beg of you."
SAMANTHA	I have breast cancer.
IRANDA	What?
SAMANTHA	See? It's now my special fucking day.
IRANDA	You have breast cancer?
SAMANTHA	"Hey, no tears."
SAMANTHA	"Miranda, I expected more from you."
CHARLOTTE	"See, this is what we were afraid of. Go back to your people."
CHARLOTTE	We'll talk about this later.
IRANDA	You are my people and we'll talk about it now.
IRANDA	Now start at the beginning.
CARRIE	You are the bossiest bride in the world.
IRANDA	Yes I am and you have to do everything I say.
SAMANTHA	Oh.
IRANDA	Now start talking.
SAMANTHA	Okay. Do you remember when
CARRIE	"For better or for worse,"
CARRIE	we were all ourselves that day.
CARRIE	Just the way Miranda wanted it.
CARRIE	I've been dating the Russian for two months when we hit a relationship benchmarks
CARRIE	so rare I didn't even know it existed.
CARRIE	He gave me his alarm code.
ALEKSANDR	And I had the keys made.
CARRIE	You made me a set of keys?
ALEKSANDR	"I had my assistant go to locksmith, but..."
ALEKSANDR	"yes, keys were made."
ALEKSANDR	"Ok, what's the code?"
CARRIE	"Uh, it's..."
CARRIE	"4, 7, 3,"
CARRIE	5?
ALEKSANDR	I'll write it down for you.
CARRIE	It was a kind of security I'd never experienced in a relationship.
CARRIE	His alarm code.
CARRIE	Like it was nothing.
CARRIE	Do you really wanna hear about this now?
SAMANTHA	"Oh, yes, I need the distraction."
CARRIE	Samantha was feeling less secure as we waited for the results of her lumpectomy.
CARRIE	"It's gonna be fine, sweetie."
CARRIE	"They got it out, it's going to be fine."
SAMANTHA	"I know, I know."
SAMANTHA	"So, Petrovsky?"
CARRIE	"Oh, ok, well, it was just so easy."
CARRIE	I mean Big made me beg for a key in front of his doorman whereas
CARRIE	the Russian had just welcomed me into his life and his apartment.
CARRIE	Did I mention the extra robe in the bathroom?
SAMANTHA	Is it as nice as this one?
CARRIE	Even nicer if you can believe it.
CARRIE	Hi.
DR. PINKER	"Hello, I'm Dr. Pinkner."
SAMANTHA	"Hi, how do you do? My friend Carrie."
SAMANTHA	"Hello, doctor."
DR. PINKER	"Well, Samantha, I have good news."
DR. PINKER	"The lumpectomy went very well,"
DR. PINKER	"all your scans look clean, and I classify you as stage one."
CARRIE	And one is..?
SAMANTHA	the best. right?
DR. PINKER	Yeah.
SAMANTHA	"Ok, ok."
SAMANTHA	"Oh, cold."
DR. PINKER	You're healing nicely.
DR. PINKER	"Now, because of the nature of your tumor,"
DR. PINKER	I would still recommend a course of chemo.
SAMANTHA	I still have to have..
DR. PINKER	"Chemotherapy, yes. As a precaution."
SAMANTHA	I don't understand how this happened to me.
DR. PINKER	"It could be gentics, but since there's no breast cancer in your family,"
DR. PINKER	"it could be a variety of factors,"
DR. PINKER	"diet, lifestyle choices."
SAMANTHA	lifestyle choices?
DR. PINKER	Some studies have shown women who haven't had children
DR. PINKER	have an increased chance of getting it.
SAMANTHA	I see.
SAMANTHA	So I brought this on myself?
DR. PINKER	"No, I'm just giving you the basic..."
SAMANTHA	I think we're done here.
DR. PINKER	Maybe I wasn't clear.
SAMANTHA	"Give me my chart. I'm going to find some woman doctor,"
SAMANTHA	some hot woman doctor who understands what this is all about.
DR. PINKER	I just meant statistically...
SAMANTHA	You're lucky to have touched my breasts.
SAMANTHA	"Carrie, my purse."
CARRIE	It was hard to be huffy in a cloth robe but somehow Samantha pulled it off.
CARRIE	"All right then, good to meet you."
SAMANTHA	Like it's my fault.
SAMANTHA	"I shouldn't be punished for not having kids,"
SAMANTHA	I should be rewarded.
SAMANTHA	Since when did kids become the get-out-of-cancer-free card?
SAMANTHA	He's basically saying that I'm a whore who deserves chemo.
CARRIE	"No, I don't think that's what he was saying."
IRANDA	What I don't understand is if they got it all why do you need chemo?
SAMANTHA	Because he's an asshole.
CARRIE	Evidently there can be something microscopic.
SAMANTHA	Like his dick.
CARRIE	"Excuse me, do you have cancer or Tourette's?"
SAMANTHA	"I'm getting a new doctor, a woman."
IRANDA	I think you should.
CHARLOTTE	I have heard great things about Dr. Mc..
SAMANTHA	"Andrew, I'm on it."
SAMANTHA	"Top rated oncologist by New York magazine, four years running."
SAMANTHA	I'm trying to get in.
IRANDA	"Oh, I'm sorry."
IRANDA	I gotta get back to the office.
IRANDA	I'm taking a long weekend so I can't take a long lunch.
CARRIE	Long weekend?
IRANDA	You never take long weekends.
IRANDA	"Steve wanted to go on a little trip,"
IRANDA	so we're driving up to some mountain lodge tomorrow.
IRANDA	It's supposed to nice.
CARRIE	"slow down There, Miss."
CARRIE	Is this little trip your honeymoon?
IRANDA	"No, it's just a whatever."
CARRIE	"And yet, you just got married last week."
CARRIE	That's interesting.
CHARLOTTE	It's your honeymoon.
IRANDA	here we go.
CHARLOTTE	Who's taking care of Brady?
IRANDA	We're bringing him.
CHARLOTTE	"Well, it's not a real honeymoon if Brady's there."
IRANDA	Then I guess it's a whatever.
SAMANTHA	What have you got against honeymoons?
SAMANTHA	"It's basically sex with room service, right?"
CHARLOTTE	You have to have a real honeymoon. It's very important.
IRANDA	To whom?
CARRIE	"Yeah, I'm with? Davis on this one."
CARRIE	Just leave Brady with Magda.
IRANDA	It's four days. I've already given her the time off.
IRANDA	"She's made plans, she's going to nanny paluza or something."
CHARLOTTE	"I'll take him, I'd love to take him."
CHARLOTTE	He's adorable.
IRANDA	"It's four days, adorables tops after a day and a half."
CARRIE	"Well, I could take care of him part of the time."
CARRIE	"What? I'm his godmother, it's the least I can do."
CARRIE	I can handle him for a couple of days.
CARRIE	I saw that.
IRANDA	You Guys Would really do that?
CARRIE	Absolutely.
CHARLOTTE	with pleasure.
SAMANTHA	I wouldn't because Smith is coming back into town
SAMANTHA	and I've always chosen sex over babies.
SAMANTHA	And that's apparently why I got cancer.
CARRIE	"The next day, I tried on two labels."
CARRIE	Classic Vuitton and new mommy.
CARRIE	Yeah.
CARRIE	Now we're gonna go into carriage and we're gonna see the..
CARRIE	"oop, my phone is ringing."
CARRIE	You stay here.
CARRIE	"Yeah, hello."
CHARLOTTE	So how's it going?
CARRIE	I think that I was just mistaken for a mother by a mother.
CHARLOTTE	So he's okay?
CARRIE	"Yes, Brady and I are having a lovely time."
CARRIE	"In fact, we are going to spend the afternoon at the Hotel Petrovsky."
CHARLOTTE	Is he a baby person?
CARRIE	"Well, I wouldn't have guessed it but when I told him I had Brady for the day"
CARRIE	he said to bring him over.
CHARLOTTE	But is it safe?
CHARLOTTE	Are there stairs? What about sharp edges?
CARRIE	"Charlotte, it's death trap, we're just gonna strap a pillow around the kid and hope for the best."
CARRIE	"And further downtown, Samantha was in hot pursuit of the hot woman doctor."
SAMANTHA	"Hi, I'm Samantha Jones, we've spoke on the phone several times."
RECEPTIONIST	"Uh huh, please stay behind the partition."
SAMANTHA	"Sorry, I know that you said Dr. McAndrew was booked,"
SAMANTHA	but I was referred here by Dr. Ward and Dr. Pappum
SAMANTHA	who both attended the Paint for the Cure Benefit I threw.
RECEPTIONIST	"I'm sorry, the doctor can't. She's booked through March."
SAMANTHA	My good friend Susan Schaeffer who threw the Dance for the Cure Benefit
SAMANTHA	said that sometimes Dr. McAndrew can squeeze you in if you just show up.
RECEPTIONIST	March.
SAMANTHA	"Well, who do you have to fuck to get chemo around here?"
RECEPTIONIST	Excuse me?
SAMANTHA	"I'm sorry, I'm upset."
SAMANTHA	I'm dealing with cancer.
RECEPTIONIST	All of New York is dealing with cancer.
RECEPTIONIST	Not to mention some very pushy people in Los Angeles and Miami
SAMANTHA	Fine. I'll just take a seat and hope for an opening.
RECEPTIONIST	"No, doctor has no openings till March."
SAMANTHA	You already said that.
NUN	"You know, I've been here since 9 am so"
NUN	if anyone's going to get in without an appointment
NUN	it's me.
SAMANTHA	Loud and clear. Don't worry about me.
SAMANTHA	I'll get in.
NUN	"Well, I've been waiting for two days and so far no one's gotten in yet."
SAMANTHA	I was once told I wouldn't be able to get backstage to see Mick Jagger.
SAMANTHA	"Well, I did get backstage and I blew him."
NUN	Oh.
SAMANTHA	"Excuse me, I don't know if this is an appropriate question to ask."
NUN	I think we passed appropriate a few seconds ago.
SAMANTHA	What kind of cancer do you have?
NUN	Breast.
SAMANTHA	"Breast. me, too."
SAMANTHA	"I'm curious, do you have children?"
NUN	I'm a nun.
SAMANTHA	You have none.
NUN	"No, No, No, I am a nun."
NUN	But that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy your Mick Jagger story.
SAMANTHA	I thought that nuns had to wear..
NUN	"Oh, I haven't worn a habit in years."
SAMANTHA	"So then, you don't have sex."
NUN	no.
SAMANTHA	never had sex.
NUN	no.
SAMANTHA	Ah.
SAMANTHA	Just one more.
NUN	"Oh, Go Right ahead."
SAMANTHA	Are you allowed to masturbate?
NUN	I never asked.
NUN	But thanks for getting my mind off cancer for the first time in a week.
SAMANTHA	"Oh, happy to help."
CARRIE	"Samantha felt a little better knowing that saints and sinners, despite their habits,"
CARRIE	get the same treatment when it comes to cancer.
CARRIE	"And so far, that was no treatment at all."
CARRIE	"Ok, we're here. Hey, come on in, Brady."
CARRIE	He gave us a candy.(?)
CARRIE	"Oh no, no, no, no."
CARRIE	Oh my gosh. ok.
CARRIE	"4, 7,..."
ALEKSANDR	Oh hi.
CARRIE	Brady knocked the vase over.
ALEKSANDR	"That's pathetic, blaming the baby."
CARRIE	"Well, my other plan was just to leave and pretend you'd been burgled."
CARRIE	You want the keys back right now?
ALEKSANDR	"Noise, yes. The alarm."
ALEKSANDR	"Yes, she's clumsy, isn't she?"
ALEKSANDR	Look at you.
CARRIE	Aleksandr holding the baby was the most disarming thing of all.
CARRIE	"And upstate, in honeymoon central."
IRANDA	That was really great.
IRANDA	Now what?
STEVE	What do you mean?
STEVE	Relax.
IRANDA	do You think we should Go for a walk Or something?
STEVE	Nah.
STEVE	Let's just? here. Hang out.
STEVE	how often do we get to do that?
IRANDA	That's true.
IRANDA	So do You think we should get dressed?
STEVE	I plan on Being naked for the Next four days.
IRANDA	I'm gonna unpack.
STEVE	Knock yourself out.
IRANDA	There's no TV or radio.
STEVE	"Are you ok there, partner?"
IRANDA	I'm fine.
IRANDA	"But hey, there is a CD player and a CD."
IRANDA	Sounds of mohonk mountain.
IRANDA	Shit.
STEVE	What's the matter?
IRANDA	I forgot my cell phone charger.
STEVE	"You're not gonna need your cell phone, it's just you and me."
CARRIE	"As Miranda got a crash course in life as a twosome,"
CARRIE	I got a glimpse of life as a threesome.
ALEKSANDR	He's good. This is your best of work yet.
ALEKSANDR	The guy's a genius.
ALEKSANDR	Reminiscent of the early Basquiat.
CARRIE	You're very good with him.
ALEKSANDR	Have you ever thought about having children?
ALEKSANDR	I have one.
CARRIE	Oh.
CARRIE	Many years ago.
ALEKSANDR	No more children.
ALEKSANDR	"Actually, I cannot. I.."
ALEKSANDR	Yeah.
CARRIE	so.
ALEKSANDR	Closed the factory.
ALEKSANDR	How about you? You never wanted children?
CARRIE	"No, I've always thought that I might,"
CARRIE	"I just, you know, I just haven't gotten around to it yet."
ALEKSANDR	And when are you planning to do this?
ALEKSANDR	How old are you? 38?
CARRIE	I felt like I was just shot with a.38.
CARRIE	The Russian doesn't want to have kids.
CARRIE	Had one a long time ago. It's done.
CHARLOTTE	"Well, then Dosvedanya or however you say it."
CARRIE	"What? No, for you maybe, but not for me."
CHARLOTTE	Don't you wanna have the option?
CARRIE	"Well, yes. But it is my experience that man like him"
CARRIE	don't come along that often.
CHARLOTTE	But we're 38.
CHARLOTTE	These are the years.
CARRIE	"Yes, I know. I've heard I'm running out of time."
CARRIE	I don't even have time to eat this cookie.
CHARLOTTE	how is it?
CARRIE	It's so good I forgot to have children.
CHARLOTTE	Maybe he'll change his mind.
CARRIE	"No, no, I don't think so."
CARRIE	he had a vasectomy.
CHARLOTTE	Is he willing to have it reversed?
CHARLOTTE	But those are reversible.
CARRIE	I can't ask him that.
CARRIE	I don't even know his birthday yet.
CHARLOTTE	"Well, Too bad."
CHARLOTTE	"At our age, you have to be able to talk about having children if you think it might get serious."
CARRIE	"That attitude, by the way, that awareness on the part of a woman"
CARRIE	that time is ticking is very sexy to a man.
CHARLOTTE	But you can't be scared to have those talks.
CARRIE	Why not?
CARRIE	"It is, it's a perfectly scary conversation."
CARRIE	I didn't even wanted to have it with myself.
CHARLOTTE	What is that mean?
CARRIE	"It means that if I really wanted to have a baby,"
CARRIE	wouldn't I have tried to have one by now?
CARRIE	"I wantd to be a writer, I made myself a writer."
CARRIE	"I want a ridiculously extravagant pair of shoes,"
CARRIE	I find a way to buy them.
CHARLOTTE	But this is totally different.
CHARLOTTE	You have been waiting for the right man and the right time.
CARRIE	"Yes, that's exactly the way it goes in my head too."
CARRIE	Maybe I'm not just a baby person.
CHARLOTTE	Why should you give up having a baby for a man who you hardly know?
CARRIE	Why should I give up a man for a baby I hardly know I want?
CHARLOTTE	"I think you're a baby person, you're a closeted baby person."
CARRIE	What?
CARRIE	You didn't even want to leave Brady for two days.
CHARLOTTE	"Well, look at how well you did."
CARRIE	Hi.
CHARLOTTE	I think you should definitely have a baby.
CARRIE	Ok.
CHARLOTTE	So what did he have? A boy or a girl?
CARRIE	"Um, I forgot to ask."
CARRIE	"See, baby person would've asked."
CARRIE	"All right, I should get home, get some work done."
CHARLOTTE	"Well, then why don't you just keep Brady a little longer till dinner time at least?"
CARRIE	"What, you think I'm gonna decide if I'm a baby person"
CARRIE	in the next couple of hours?
CHARLOTTE	You still have a couple of years.
IRANDA	I'm starting to prune.
STEVE	You know what would be romantic?
IRANDA	"We have a fire, a bubble bath, champagne."
IRANDA	What would be romantic?
STEVE	I wanna wash your hair.
IRANDA	I washed it already.
STEVE	"I know, but I wanna wash it for you."
STEVE	"You know, like in 'Out of Africa'?"
STEVE	Hold this soap.
IRANDA	Ok.
STEVE	What could be better than that?
IRANDA	Ow
IRANDA	Hurts Soap in my eye.
STEVE	oK.
CARRIE	Hello.
IRANDA	I'm having an anxiety attack.
CARRIE	Brady is fine.
CARRIE	"Good, but that's not why I'm calling."
IRANDA	I'm in the woods in my neglige and my cell phone only has two bars left.
IRANDA	Help!
CARRIE	Are you lost?
IRANDA	Completely.
IRANDA	"This whole place, this whole trip is screaming,"
IRANDA	you should be having sex with your husband again.
IRANDA	"The fire, the tub. We've already done it twice today."
IRANDA	It's like sex is the only thing on the itinerary.
CARRIE	So you two are getting along.
IRANDA	"Of course, it's our honeymoon."
CARRIE	Where's he?
IRANDA	In bed. It's our honeymoon.
IRANDA	He thinks I'm getting ice.
CARRIE	"Well, then, don't forget the ice."
IRANDA	"Last night, Steve and I held hands for an hour and a half watching the fire."
IRANDA	"He was looking into my eyes,"
IRANDA	I was looking for the remote.
IRANDA	It feels good to be sarcastic.
IRANDA	You can't be sarcastic on your honeymoon.
CARRIE	You should talk to Steve.
IRANDA	I can't talk to Steve. He's on his honeymoon.
IRANDA	How's Brady? I miss him.
CARRIE	He's great.
CARRIE	We're great.
CARRIE	"So, this whole motherhood thing, all it's cracked up to be?"
IRANDA	"Ok, there's something in the bushes"
IRANDA	and I hope it's wild animal and not Steve coming to have sex with me again.
IRANDA	"I should be able to do this, Carrie."
IRANDA	This should be the most romantic time of my life.
IRANDA	Racoon.
IRANDA	"After Miranda used the's' word twice,"
CARRIE	I wondered if should was another disease plagueing women.
CARRIE	"Did we want babies and perfect honeymoons,"
CARRIE	or did we think we should have babies and perfect honeymoons?
CARRIE	How do we separate what we could do and what we should do?
CARRIE	And here's an alarming thought.
CARRIE	"It's not just peer pressure, it seems to be coming from within."
CARRIE	Why are we should-ing all over ourselves?
CARRIE	Then there are the shoulds of promoting film
CARRIE	"which Samantha should have been in favor of,"
CARRIE	but she wasn't in the mood.
SAMANTHA	You should stay at the party. Harvey Weinstein is here.
SMITH	I did enough parties in L.A.
SMITH	I'd rather go home with my girl.
PHOTOGRAPHERS	"Smith, Smith, right here."
SAMANTHA	I really don't feel like having my photograph taken tonight.
SAMANTHA	I'm gonna go out first and we'll talk tomorrow.
SMITH	What's going on?
SMITH	We haven't spent a night together since I've been back.
SMITH	did I do something?
SAMANTHA	"No, no, it's not you."
SMITH	Something's up. You're quiet all night.
SMITH	You didn't even talk that much last couple of times we had phone sex.
SAMANTHA	"Smith, when you were in L.A., they found a lump in my breast and it's cancer."
PHOTOGRAPHERS	Smith.
CARRIE	"The next day, at the Hotel vasectomy, I had some questions for the man next to me."
CARRIE	"So, this child you had."
ALEKSANDR	Yes?
CARRIE	how old is..?
ALEKSANDR	She.
CARRIE	she? Yes.
ALEKSANDR	"Her name's Chloe, she's twenty-two."
ALEKSANDR	"She lives in Paris, and her mother lives there too."
CARRIE	And you were married to her mother?
ALEKSANDR	"Yes, it's the only time I was married."
ALEKSANDR	"Lasted seven years, five of them good."
ALEKSANDR	This is my little thing at age four.(?)
ALEKSANDR	In our little house in Santorini.
CARRIE	She's beautiful.
ALEKSANDR	Still is.
CARRIE	That's her mother?
ALEKSANDR	Uh-huh.
CARRIE	She's lovely and so young.
ALEKSANDR	I was young then too.
CARRIE	So...
CARRIE	why only one child?
ALEKSANDR	I like my life the way I like it.
ALEKSANDR	I got really lucky with Chloe.
ALEKSANDR	"Somehow, it worked out."
ALEKSANDR	"Look, it's her seventh birthday."
ALEKSANDR	Everything is purple.
ALEKSANDR	"Purple cake, purple dress, purple shoes."
ALEKSANDR	It was great.
CARRIE	"So, so funny."
CARRIE	"There it was, wrapped up in a bow."
CARRIE	The whole life that I am never gonna have with him
CARRIE	because he had it already with somebody else.
CARRIE	"And I know I shouldn't say this to someone with cancer,"
SAMANTHA	but...
CARRIE	why me?
SAMANTHA	Let it rip
CARRIE	"Well, I guess it's not going to happen."
CARRIE	"That life, if I'm with him."
SAMANTHA	"Then, bye bye baby."
SAMANTHA	What else is on the menu?
CARRIE	What do you mean?
SAMANTHA	There are a lot of fabulous things in life that don't include a baby.
SAMANTHA	What would that be like?
CARRIE	"Well, him, sex, and travel."
CARRIE	"Comfort, love, and extraordinary adventures."
SAMANTHA	Not too shabby.
CARRIE	If that's where this is going.
CARRIE	And at this point I've been only invited in as far as a security code and a robe.
CARRIE	And the question that I need to ask is just..
CARRIE	It's impossible to ask.
SAMANTHA	And what is that?
CARRIE	Will you love me enough..
CARRIE	to make up for the fact that I didn't have a baby.
SAMANTHA	Oh honey no.
CARRIE	"Exactly, it's only been two months."
CARRIE	38 years and two months.
SAMANTHA	"No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
CARRIE	I know. It's too early in the relationship to have that conversation and...
CARRIE	But it's too late in life not to.
CARRIE	It's a catch-38.
CARRIE	"And after safely putting Brady to bed in his very sturdy crib,"
CARRIE	Charlotte and Harry enjoyed some romance as well.
CHARLOTTE	Oh my god.
CHARLOTTE	Oh my god.
CHARLOTTE	Oh my god! Stop!
HARRY	What? What happened?
CHARLOTTE	Brady saw us having sex. I've scarred him for life.
HARRY	Him? You scarred me for life.
CHARLOTTE	Brady.
CHARLOTTE	Look away.
IRANDA	Hello.
CHARLOTTE	I have bad news.
IRANDA	"Ok, you need to spit it out. Do we need to come home?"
CHARLOTTE	Brady saw us having sex.
IRANDA	And?
CHARLOTTE	he was looking at me during.
IRANDA	"Charlotte, he doesn't know what he's looking at."
IRANDA	He doesn't know where his nose is.
CHARLOTTE	Are you sure?
CHARLOTTE	"Harry, Brady can't be anywhere near this conversation."
HARRY	I think it may be too late.
HARRY	He just said sex is dirty.
CHARLOTTE	That's not funny.
IRANDA	"Charlotte, he's fine."
IRANDA	But..
IRANDA	"you sound tense, maybe I should still come home."
CHARLOTTE	"No, I'm sorry to bother you. Go back to your honeymoon."
IRANDA	I still have a bar left. No!
STEVE	What?
STEVE	Are you on a phone?
IRANDA	"Charlotte panicked, but everything's fine."
STEVE	"Then, come back to bed."
IRANDA	I don't need to come to bed. I'm rested.
STEVE	So am I. Come on.
IRANDA	"Steve, I can't have sex anymore. I have a brain."
STEVE	I know you have a brain.
IRANDA	"I love you, but I can't love you this often."
IRANDA	"I can't love you twice a day, everyday."
IRANDA	I'm going crazy here.
IRANDA	"I miss ESPN, and NPR, and Dateline."
IRANDA	I am not the honeymoon type.
IRANDA	Do you hate me?
STEVE	"No, I don't hate you."
STEVE	"But it was my honeymoon, too."
STEVE	I like being quiet sometimes.
STEVE	I like reading a book.
IRANDA	Four days is a long time.
STEVE	"It isn't, actually."
STEVE	But it's all I have from work.
CARRIE	"Suddenly, Miranda understood the new should in her life."
CARRIE	The things you should do for someone you love.
IRANDA	"I'm sorry, Steve. I'm an asshole."
STEVE	"Yeah, you are. But you're my asshole."
IRANDA	"That's sweet, and gross at the same time."
STEVE	"Well, relax."
STEVE	We're leaving in the morning. The honeymoon's over.
IRANDA	Say that again.
STEVE	The honeymoon's over.
CARRIE	"For Miranda, once the honeymoon was over, it could finally begin."
STEVE	"Hey, I got a brain, you know."
CARRIE	"The next day, at Dr. McAndrew's office,"
CARRIE	impatient patients were getting desperate.
NUN	God bless.
SAMANTHA	"Pulling out all the stops, huh?"
NUN	"Well, what else was I gonna wear?"
NUN	A big tumor?
SAMANTHA	This is my second day at this f--ucacta
SAMANTHA	office and my good friend features editor at Vanity Fair..
RECEPTIONIST	"Ms. Jones, I told a thousand times."
RECEPTIONIST	There's nothing I can do.
RECEPTIONIST	Oh my god.
SAMANTHA	Is this..?
RECEPTIONIST	You're Smith's girlfriend?
SAMANTHA	"Well, yes, I suppose I am."
CARRIE	It was the one name Samantha hadn't dropped.
RECEPTIONIST	Oh my gosh.
RECEPTIONIST	I love him.
RECEPTIONIST	He's my screensaver.
SAMANTHA	Oh.
RECEPTIONIST	What's he like?
SAMANTHA	"Well, he's a.."
SAMANTHA	"He's a very loyal boyfriend, always by my side."
SAMANTHA	He would probably come here with me if I had an appointment.
RECEPTIONIST	"here, Smith in this office?"
SAMANTHA	Ah-huh.
RECEPTIONIST	"Oh my gosh, um. Let'see. Um, well."
RECEPTIONIST	"Sometimes, I make an appointment at 8 o'clock."
RECEPTIONIST	"She doesn't like it, but she'll do it."
SAMANTHA	I can come at 8.
RECEPTIONIST	"And Smith, does he get up that early?"
SAMANTHA	"For this, I think we would."
SAMANTHA	"Oh, and um, if you could get her an appointment,"
SAMANTHA	he might kiss you on the lips.
RECEPTIONIST	You're tomorrow at 8 a. m.
RECEPTIONIST	She's 7:45.
SAMANTHA	Thank you so much.
CARRIE	Smith turned out to be more than a screensaver.
CARRIE	He was a life saver.
SAMANTHA	We're in.
NUN	Oh my god.
SAMANTHA	"No, oh my boyfriend."
CARRIE	And that is how Smith got Samantha in plus nun.
ALEKSANDR	Are you cold?
CARRIE	"No, I'm ok."
ALEKSANDR	You're very quiet today.
ALEKSANDR	What is it?
CARRIE	"This vasectomy,"
CARRIE	"it's not reversible, is it?"
ALEKSANDR	I guess not for me.
CARRIE	Ok.
ALEKSANDR	"And we're quiet again, huh?"
CARRIE	I know you may think it's way too early to saywhat I'm about to say but...
CARRIE	it's not.
ALEKSANDR	Say what?
CARRIE	I think that...
CARRIE	I could really be with you
CARRIE	and I just wanna say that...
CARRIE	"if this is something you are thinking,"
CARRIE	I need to know because...
CARRIE	I'm 38 as you said and so..
CARRIE	I'm 38.
ALEKSANDR	38 is young.
CARRIE	Well..
CARRIE	It depends who you're talking to.
ALEKSANDR	"So here we are, so soon."
ALEKSANDR	"As you said, I..."
ALEKSANDR	I could really be with you as well.
ALEKSANDR	"But believe me, I know who I am and I won't change my mind."
ALEKSANDR	I'm simply too old for that.
ALEKSANDR	Being a parent is an extraordinary thing.
ALEKSANDR	I wouldn't want you to miss that
ALEKSANDR	if it's something you want.
ALEKSANDR	And you should have everything you want.
CARRIE	I am kinda cold.
ALEKSANDR	Come here.
CARRIE	"I didn't know what exactly I wanted,"
CARRIE	but I felt like I was getting warmer.
CARRIE	"When you're dating someone new, everything can seem foreign."
CARRIE	Especially when you're dating someone foreign.
CARRIE	My Russian had been taking me around the world.
CARRIE	"Greece in Astoria, Italy in the Bronx."
CARRIE	"Tonight, it was Korea; on W.32nd St."
ALEKSANDR	Wow. You look..
CARRIE	Why thank you. So.
CARRIE	Where to tonight?
ALEKSANDR	"Very, very exotic place."
CARRIE	Really?
CARRIE	"Well just so you know,"
CARRIE	I'm fully vaccinated.
ALEKSANDR	Good.
CARRIE	"So, should we get a cab?"
ALEKSANDR	I've not been to this mysterious place before.
ALEKSANDR	But I believe we can walk.
CARRIE	I'm intrigued. Continue.
ALEKSANDR	Turn around. We're going to your place.
CARRIE	Art smart. The man can cook.
ALEKSANDR	Have never made the risotto in frying pan before.
CARRIE	I'm sorry. I don't use my kitchen.
CARRIE	"And I don't usually make my guests sit on the floor next to my stack of Vogues,"
CARRIE	which I ordinarily hide in the tub for company.
CARRIE	And the walls..
ALEKSANDR	I love your house. It's so you.
CARRIE	Small and artless?
ALEKSANDR	No. Warm and lovely.
CARRIE	Are you okay?
ALEKSANDR	My foot sleeps.
ALEKSANDR	Now we'll have espresso?
CARRIE	Great. Where?
CARRIE	I don't have an espresso machine.
ALEKSANDR	"And you call yourself a writer, yeah?"
CARRIE	"Well. I may have an old Mr. Coffee One Cup but,"
CARRIE	don't hold your breath. Oh my god.
ALEKSANDR	Okay. We go out.
CARRIE	Oh okay.
CARRIE	Oh that mouse is dead. Wow.
ALEKSANDR	It was a rodent.
ALEKSANDR	You don't want this in your house.
CARRIE	Well maybe he was just crossing through to get to the much nicer apartment next door.
ALEKSANDR	You call this denial.
ALEKSANDR	"Where there's one, there will be more."
CARRIE	"Yeah, we're going out."
CARRIE	At least it didn't happen in a room I actually used like my closet.
IRANDA	Good humor me.
CARRIE	"The next morning, we were determined to use our good humors"
CARRIE	to make Samantha's kemo lounge as close as possible to a cocktail lounge.
SAMANTHA	Look at Miranda working Mr. Grape there.
SAMANTHA	Steve is one lucky guy.
CHARLOTTE	Samantha.
NURSE	Well you guys are having a good time.
SAMANTHA	You bet. Cancer is hilarious.
NURSE	Are all you as fun as Samantha?
CARRIE	We try.
SAMANTHA	I'm her favorite patient.
NURSE	Any mouth sores Sweetie?
SAMANTHA	no.
NURSE	Great. Just keep up the Popsicles.
IRANDA	"Samantha I have to say, you are amazing."
SAMANTHA	"I am. And if you love me in chemo,"
SAMANTHA	wait till you see me at Smith's movie premiere.
SAMANTHA	"I'm getting a hot dress, fantastic shoes."
SAMANTHA	I'm going to kick cancer and that red carpet's ass.
CARRIE	"Hear, hear."
CARRIE	It's not at all what I expected.
CARRIE	They have these barker loungers and videos and Popsicles.
CARRIE	"You throw in Shuffle Board, it'd be a vacation in Miami."
ALEKSANDR	"Ah, here they are."
CARRIE	"Later, the Russian took me somewhere else I've never been before."
CARRIE	The Kitchen Supplies Department.
CARRIE	She doesn't even look sick.
ALEKSANDR	"But she is sick, yes?"
CARRIE	"Well, she was. But she's gonna be fine."
ALEKSANDR	Had a friend who had breast cancer.
ALEKSANDR	She died.
ALEKSANDR	I think this one is you.
CARRIE	From Kitchen supplies to a kitchen surprise.
CHARLOTTE	Hello.
CHARLOTTE	"Oh, hi Dr. Steiner."
CHARLOTTE	Oh.
CHARLOTTE	None of them?
CHARLOTTE	Sure. I understand.
CHARLOTTE	Thanks for calling on a Saturday. Bye.
CHARLOTTE	None of my eggs were viable.
HARRY	Oh baby.
CHARLOTTE	Again.
HARRY	What do you want to do?
CHARLOTTE	Try IVF again.
HARRY	Sure? We've already tried it twice.
CHARLOTTE	Yeah. I'm sure. It'll work.
CHARLOTTE	"I mean, it has to."
HARRY	You okay?
CHARLOTTE	Yeah. I'm gonna go for a run.
CARRIE	"In high school, Charlotte was voted most popular,"
CARRIE	head of the track team and class president.
CARRIE	She had won everything.
CARRIE	Except the baby race.
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, across town a couple who had won the baby race,"
CARRIE	had lost their bedroom to their baby.
IRANDA	"Wait, we saw this one. Charming,"
IRANDA	mid-town two-bedroom?
IRANDA	Why don't they say what it really is?
IRANDA	Crack house on a airshaft.
IRANDA	"Scout, off! Off!"
STEVE	Hey. Listen to this one.
STEVE	"In our price range, three-bedroom."
IRANDA	I'm putting my shoes on.
STEVE	Outdoor space.
IRANDA	I'm getting my bag.
STEVE	Finished basement.
IRANDA	It's a house.
STEVE	in Brooklyn.
IRANDA	"Okay, Shoes are off."
IRANDA	What did I tell you about that side of the paper?
STEVE	"What, it's a good place."
IRANDA	"Steve, we're not moving to Brooklyn."
IRANDA	I'm a Manhattan girl.
IRANDA	I don't like anything not Manhattan.
STEVE	"Hey, I'm Queens and I'm pretty cute."
STEVE	Let's just look at it.
IRANDA	Sleeping in the dining room isn't so bad.
IRANDA	We're near the kitchen.
IRANDA	Did you let Fatty out of the laundry room?
STEVE	We don't even need this.
STEVE	We can hear Brady through the wall.
STEVE	"Miranda, we can't keep living like this."
IRANDA	"Scout, down."
IRANDA	Fine. I'll look at it.
CARRIE	Oh. Wow.
ALEKSANDR	what?
CARRIE	That is some strong coffee.
CARRIE	Oh. Well. No wonder you work all night.
ALEKSANDR	That's the way I like it.
CARRIE	I'm gonna need a little milk in this.
ALEKSANDR	Then it's not espresso.
ALEKSANDR	Milk will ruin it. Keep sipping it.
ALEKSANDR	You'll see.
CARRIE	I need to talk to You about something.
CARRIE	Yes.
ALEKSANDR	You know the other day when I was talking about my friend?
CARRIE	One with cancer?
CARRIE	Her name is Samantha.
CARRIE	I just felt like you weren't being very sensitive about my feelings.
CARRIE	I mentioned her and your first response was to tell me about your friend.
ALEKSANDR	Who died. Yeah.
CARRIE	"Yes. See, exactly."
CARRIE	I'm sorry about your friend.
CARRIE	But my friend is going to be fine.
ALEKSANDR	And my friend died.
CARRIE	See? You're doing it again.
CARRIE	Not everyone dies.
ALEKSANDR	Then they're lucky.
CARRIE	Okay. Maybe I'm not being very clear.
ALEKSANDR	"Oh, you're being clear."
ALEKSANDR	You don't want your friend to die.
CARRIE	Please. Stop saying die.
ALEKSANDR	"But to be realistic,"
ALEKSANDR	"you must acknowledge this possibility, yes?"
CARRIE	No. They caught it early at Stage 1
CARRIE	and she's having the Cadillac of chemo.
CARRIE	"No, she is going to be fine."
CARRIE	And your scaring me isn't helping.
ALEKSANDR	"All I'm saying when my friend died,"
CARRIE	Okay I don't know why but.. you are not listening to me.
ALEKSANDR	You're not listeing to me.
CARRIE	Are you kidding? All I've said is... please don't talk about your friend who died.
ALEKSANDR	Her name was Sophie.
CARRIE	I'm leaving.
ALEKSANDR	What are you talking about? We're having espresso.
CARRIE	"No, we're not espresso."
CARRIE	We are not listening.
ALEKSANDR	"Sit down, finish your coffee. It's hot."
CARRIE	I'm leaving.
CARRIE	Excuse..
CARRIE	"you know, I asked you not to mention your friend."
CARRIE	And now all I can think about is your friend
CARRIE	and my friend has nothing to do with your friend
ALEKSANDR	Think you're acting like a child.
CARRIE	And I think you're acting like an asshole.
ALEKSANDR	Maybe you should go for now.
CARRIE	I'm already going.
CARRIE	It was my first fight with the Russian
CARRIE	and I didn't know if it was the strong espresso
CARRIE	"or the strong words but either way,"
CARRIE	not even my feet slept that night.
CHARLOTTE	Oh my goodness.
CHARLOTTE	Look at you and your little coat.
CHARLOTTE	Did you go shopping?
DOG OWNER	Princess Dandy Rich Brandy Wine. Come!
CHARLOTTE	"Oh, I got her."
CHARLOTTE	"Oh my goodness, so cute."
TRUDY STORK	Thank you.
CHARLOTTE	That's a mighty name for such a little dog.
TRUDY STORK	It's a dog show name.
CHARLOTTE	"Oh my god, I love dog shows."
CHARLOTTE	has she ever won?
TRUDY STORK	This one? Two-time loser.
TRUDY STORK	She doesn't show anymore.
TRUDY STORK	She was bred from two champion Cavalier King Charles Spaniels
TRUDY STORK	"but when I tried to show her, it turns out she has a defect."
CHARLOTTE	Oh no.
TRUDY STORK	One of her hind legs is too short.
TRUDY STORK	Such a shame. She had so much promise.
TRUDY STORK	She just isn't a winner.
CHARLOTTE	Well. She's awfully cute anyway.
CHARLOTTE	I'm Charlotte York Goldenblatt.
TRUDY STORK	Trudy Stork. All right. Come on. That's enough.
CHARLOTTE	"Okay. Well, Nice to meet you."
TRUDY STORK	Nice to meet you. Bye-Bye.
CHARLOTTE	Bye.
CARRIE	That was the day a King Charles met an Upper East Side princess.
IRANDA	Taxi.
CARRIE	And an upper east-sider went to see a house in Brooklyn.
TAXI DRIVER	Where to?
IRANDA	Brooklyn. Please.
TAXI DRIVER	I don't go to Brooklyn.
IRANDA	"Yeah, neither do I."
CARRIE	"Miranda tried to see her future in Brooklyn,"
CARRIE	but she just couldn't get there.
SMITH	Oh yeah. Shit yeah.
SMITH	Oh god you're good.
SMITH	Oh fuck.
SAMANTHA	What? Oh Jesus.
SMITH	What do I --
SAMANTHA	Just give it to me.
SMITH	That's a lot of hair. Does that hurt?
SAMANTHA	"No, I'm fine. Really. So."
SAMANTHA	Where were we?
SMITH	oh. I'm sorry.
SAMANTHA	I'm gonna take a bath.
CARRIE	"Apparently, Samantha wasn't the only one losing something that night."
CARRIE	"Samantha's not gonna die, right?"
IRANDA	Of course not. She'll be fine.
CARRIE	Her hair started falling out at a really bad time.
IRANDA	Oh god. Was she at work?
CARRIE	No. But she was definitely doing a job.
IRANDA	No.
CARRIE	Oh yes. Ma'am.
IRANDA	She's a trooper. She'll be fine.
CARRIE	Yeah I know.
ALEKSANDR	"But according to my Russian friend, we're all in denial."
IRANDA	What? What goes he say?
CARRIE	"Well, it went like this."
CARRIE	"Him: your friend might die, yes?"
CARRIE	Me: No. You're all asshole.
CARRIE	We had our first fight.
IRANDA	I picked up on that.
CARRIE	"This is a man who is so sensitive about so much but then this death,"
CARRIE	deal with it.
CARRIE	"I know he's Russian, but Jesus, come on."
IRANDA	Maybe it's the language barrier.
CARRIE	It's definitely a barrier for me.
CARRIE	Is this who I'm seeing? A man kills mice and optimism?
IRANDA	It's not denial. They got it early.
IRANDA	She's gonna be fine.
CARRIE	You are aware that you've said she'll be fine three times in half a block.
IRANDA	"Yeah. I just picked up on that, too."
CARRIE	"In any way, how's it helping her if we freak out about it?"
CARRIE	It is our job to think positive.
IRANDA	Exactly.
CARRIE	Can you believe we're actually having this conversation?
IRANDA	No. And here's another thing I've never thought I'd be saying.
IRANDA	Steve wants us to move to Brooklyn.
CARRIE	"Okay. Stop. Now,"
CARRIE	that is information I can't handle.
IRANDA	I know. I can't move to Brooklyn.
IRANDA	Even cabs won't go there.
CARRIE	My conversation with Miranda brought me back to reality.
CARRIE	"Or more specifically,"
CARRIE	the people who want us to live in it.
CARRIE	The world tells us to get real.
CARRIE	"But what happens when living in reality means living in pain, fear, or Brooklyn."
CARRIE	"If the defense mechanism can get us through the difficult times,"
CARRIE	how bad can it be?
CARRIE	Maybe the reality is we need denial.
CARRIE	Denial: friend or foe?
CARRIE	"Denial had become Charlotte's best friend,"
CARRIE	next to Harry.
HARRY	Going for a run?
CHARLOTTE	What are You looking at?
HARRY	doing some Research.
CHARLOTTE	on what?
HARRY	Adoption.
HARRY	It could be just a backup.
HARRY	You know? If we put ourselves on some lists.
HARRY	"By the time we know what's what,"
HARRY	we'll have some choices.
HARRY	What do you think?
CHARLOTTE	That seems like the right thing to do.
CHARLOTTE	Hi. Trudy.
TRUDY STORK	Hi.
CHARLOTTE	Hi Dandy Rich. Hi.
CHARLOTTE	I brought you a present.
CHARLOTTE	It's turkey bacon. Is that all right?
TRUDY STORK	Oh sure. She's not a show dog.
CHARLOTTE	Do you like that?
TRUDY STORK	Well she really loves you.
CHARLOTTE	Who wouldn't love her.
CHARLOTTE	Look at that face.
CHARLOTTE	"You know. Just because somebody doesn't perform the way that you want them to,"
CHARLOTTE	doesn't mean you should just give up on them.
CHARLOTTE	Oh I'm sorry. I swore I wouldn't cry.
CHARLOTTE	I'm trying to have a baby and it's just not going very well.
CARRIE	"That day, thanks to a dog with one short leg,"
CARRIE	Charlotte stopped denying her shortcomings.
TRUDY STORK	I don't care for babies. Or labs.
SAMANTHA	Thanks for coming.
CARRIE	Are you kidding me? This is gonna be fun.
SAMANTHA	I used to do this when I was 16 at the mall.
SAMANTHA	Without the cancer part.
SAMANTHA	I have a movie premiere and I need to look like myself at my most fabulous.
CLERK	"What would you like, natural hair or acrylic?"
SAMANTHA	"Sweetheart, does it look like I'd do acrylic?"
CLERK	These are our best natural hair.
CLERK	Sassy and pretty-me.
SAMANTHA	No and no.
CLERK	Fine. Let's try this.
CLERK	It's from the Riding the Greek Mine.
CLERK	This looks like you?
SAMANTHA	"Carrie, how do I look?"
CARRIE	You look like Florence Henderson.
SAMANTHA	Florence Henderson in a bad wig.
SAMANTHA	"Listen, I can't be on the red carpet in a bad rug."
SAMANTHA	Do you understand?
CLERK	I know.
CLERK	This is Candy. She's very popular.
SAMANTHA	I don't think you're listening.
SAMANTHA	I don't wanna look like Candy.
SAMANTHA	I just wanna look like myself.
CLERK	Ma'am. These are wigs.
CLERK	They're not ever gonna look exactly like you.
SAMANTHA	That is not acceptable.
CLERK	We could style the bang.
SAMANTHA	Don't touch my head.
CLERK	I've worked with many women with cancer.
SAMANTHA	I don't have cancer. I have a premiere.
SAMANTHA	And I don't want some second rate wig named after a hooker.
SAMANTHA	My hair is my thing.
SAMANTHA	This is bullshit.
SAMANTHA	Carrie?
SAMANTHA	We're going.
CARRIE	I'm sorry.
SAMANTHA	I'm just so angry.
SAMANTHA	The chemo I can handle. But this hair thing. It's too much.
CARRIE	"Sweetie, we'll find you a better wig."
SAMANTHA	I have left hair all over Manhattan.
SAMANTHA	"Every time the wind blows, I have to check to make sure I'm not bald."
CARRIE	It's only temporary. It'll grow back.
SAMANTHA	"Until then, I have to look like a sick person and I don't do sick person."
CARRIE	Because you're not.
CARRIE	You're someone had a little blip of bad luck and now it's over.
SAMANTHA	What if it's not over?
CARRIE	It's over. So over.
SAMANTHA	What if it comes back?
SAMANTHA	I can die Carrie.
SAMANTHA	With really bad hair.
CARRIE	"Hey, you are not going anywhere."
SAMANTHA	"Carrie, please. Let me talk about what I'm afraid of. Please?"
CARRIE	The denial part of me wanted to say you'll be fine.
CARRIE	Instead I said.
CARRIE	Okay. I'm here.
SAMANTHA	Maybe I should just shave it all off.
CARRIE	Yeah. You could be one of those fantastic bald women who's all about earrings.
SAMANTHA	I better not look like fucking Co-jack.
SAMANTHA	"Cancer. Turns out, not so hilarious."
SAMANTHA	"After Samantha lost control, she did the only thing she knew to get it back."
SMITH	Babe?
SAMANTHA	What are you doing here?
SMITH	I got your blackberry message.
SMITH	What do you mean you're not coming to my premiere?
SAMANTHA	I'm very busy.
SAMANTHA	"I'm shaving my head, all right?"
SAMANTHA	And it's scary and awful and you can't handle it.
SMITH	Who says I can't handle it?
SAMANTHA	You freaked out after just a few little hairs.
SMITH	You freaked out too.
SAMANTHA	You lost your Hard on.
SMITH	Shit happens.
SMITH	Let me be here for you.
SAMANTHA	"Listen, this is very intense and you're being very sweet"
SAMANTHA	but there is no way that you can relate to what I'm going through.
SAMANTHA	What are you doing?
SAMANTHA	No you can't. Your hair's your thing.
SMITH	"Chill out, I'm busy."
SMITH	"When I'm done cue balling here,"
SMITH	I'm moving right over to you.
CARRIE	"That night, Smith gave Samantha the very best head of her life."
CARRIE	"The next day, Miranda endured her first out of Borough experience."
IRANDA	Broken.
IRANDA	Broken.
STEVE	"You mean.. Brooklyn, Brooklyn. Here."
STEVE	Let me show you what we could do.
STEVE	"We tear out these closets, we make this the dining room."
STEVE	Which you wouldn't have to sleep in.
STEVE	"open up this fireplace, imagine all of our friends over here,"
STEVE	"fire's going on, having some beers."
IRANDA	None of our friends are coming to Brooklyn but continue.
STEVE	Miranda.
STEVE	This isn't just about you anymore.
STEVE	"Brady's only gonna get bigger, god willing."
STEVE	Look at all this space.
STEVE	"You want the all of us. You, me, Brady, Scout, Fatty."
STEVE	"To really look at this place,"
STEVE	we're a family.
IRANDA	Oh my god. I'm married.
CARRIE	And that was the reality.
STEVE	I'm gonna take Brady and the dog outside.
STEVE	You let me know what you think.
STEVE	Come on let's go out back. Yeah.
STEVE	Let's chase the dog.
STEVE	Let's chase the dog around.
CARRIE	"That day, Miranda couldn't deny what was best for her family."
REALTOR	"So, what do you think?"
IRANDA	We're very interested but I'll gonna wanna bring in an engineer.
IRANDA	"I'd require a long escrow, and if the furnace isn't up to code,"
IRANDA	I'll need it replaced.
CARRIE	"And so, she negotiated her way into her future."
CARRIE	And Samantha realized she couldn't deny cancer.
CARRIE	She may never be exactly who she was again.
CARRIE	"So for that night, she decided to be Lil' Kim."
CARRIE	It was a very special delivery from Ms. Stork.
NOTE	You'll give her a better home than I ever could Trudy Stork
CHARLOTTE	Oh my goodness. Thank you. Hi.
CARRIE	It was a girl. 8 pounds 2 ounces.
CHARLOTTE	Oh my goodness.
CHARLOTTE	"Hello, are you hungry, precious?"
HARRY	Who is that?
CHARLOTTE	She's a present. Can we keep her?
HARRY	Anything that makes you smile like that.
HARRY	I'd be crazy not to. What's her name?
CHARLOTTE	Princess Dandy Rich Brandy Wine.
HARRY	Oh that's impossible. You gotta change it.
CHARLOTTE	What should we name you pretty girl?
CHARLOTTE	Who's the prettiest girl in the world.
CHARLOTTE	Elizabeth Taylor.
HARRY	Elizabeth Taylor Goldenblatt.
CARRIE	That was the day Elizabeth Taylor moved in with Harry and Charlotte.
CARRIE	And something far less glamorous moved in with me.
ALEKSANDR	He will stay at the fancy neighbors' now huh?
CARRIE	Thanks.
ALEKSANDR	I didn't think I would hear from you.
CARRIE	I was upset.
CARRIE	"you know, I need you to not talk so that I can say this without you confusing me."
CARRIE	Samantha is my friend.
CARRIE	She's my family. My insides.
CARRIE	She will be fine because she has to be fine.
CARRIE	That's how important she is to me.
CARRIE	"So, for you to say that she may not be just.."
CARRIE	it feels very hurtful.
CARRIE	And really unnecessary.
ALEKSANDR	Let me explain. My friend who died.
CARRIE	My god.
ALEKSANDR	"Wait. Wait. When she died,"
ALEKSANDR	I was surprised.
ALEKSANDR	The amount of pain.
ALEKSANDR	I didn't want you to be surprised like I was.
CARRIE	"Well, you could have just said that."
ALEKSANDR	We are different.
CARRIE	Yes we are.
CARRIE	I need my relationship with a little bit of milk.
ALEKSANDR	"It's clear who's the writer here, huh?"
CARRIE	Your friend will be fine.
ALEKSANDR	Thank you. And I'm sorry about Sophie.
ALEKSANDR	Thank you.
CARRIE	"That night, for the first time,"
CARRIE	we spoke the same language.
CARRIE	"So while Samantha's life and my life with the Russian would continue,"
CARRIE	"it was clear that Miranda's life as we knew it, was over."
IRANDA	"Brooklyn. I can't even say it, let alone live in it."
IRANDA	"You'll all come visit, right?"
CARRIE	Talk about denial.
CHARLOTTE	"Stop. We'll all come, won't we?"
SAMANTHA	Well I won't. I have cancer.
IRANDA	How long are you gonna play that cancer card?
SAMANTHA	As long as it takes for you to move back.
CHARLOTTE	But it's just a subway ride away.
CARRIE	Subway that goes under water. That's not normal.
WAITER	another Manhattan?
IRANDA	please. for All Of us.
CARRIE	"That night, Miranda was determined to drink in as much Manhattan as she could."
IRANDA	Do you remember that awful apartment that I had on 17th street?
CHARLOTTE	The one with the water box?
CARRIE	What about your horrifying Studio sublet in River Side Drive?
SAMANTHA	Oh I blocked it.
IRANDA	"Man, I have had some really shitty apartments here."
IRANDA	Why do I think living in Manhattan is so fantastic?
CARRIE	Because it is.
WAITER	here we go.
GROUP	Thank you.
CARRIE	It'll be childish of us to deny that our lives weren't changing.
CARRIE	"But for this night, none of us were going anywhere."
CARRIE	That's the thing about really good friends and a really great Manhattan.
CARRIE	"When it gets cold outside,"
CARRIE	New Yorkers head inside.
CARRIE	And look for ways to generate heat.
CARRIE	"Hey. Watch those hands, mister."
ALEKSANDR	"They are cold, and you are warm, so.."
CARRIE	People are looking.
ALEKSANDR	No one is looking.
JOHN PAUL SANDAL	Petrovsky.
ALEKSANDR	"Hey, hi."
AUDRA CLARK	"You're seated at the star table, I see."
ALEKSANDR	Where else would I be?
ALEKSANDR	come and join us.
AUDRA CLARK	"No, we wouldn't wanna.."
ALEKSANDR	"Yes, come."
AUDRA CLARK	You saved our lives.
AUDRA CLARK	There's ten thousand restaurants in New York and everyone's at Pastis.
ALEKSANDR	Introductions.
ALEKSANDR	"This is John Paul Sandal,"
ALEKSANDR	the most fantastic painter in New York.
JOHN PAUL SANDAL	I'm not paying for lunch.
ALEKSANDR	You know my assisstant Lee.
CARRIE	"Yes, hi."
ALEKSANDR	"Audra Clark, she's the editor of Artlife magazine."
ALEKSANDR	Carrie Bradshaw.
CARRIE	Hi.
AUDRA CLARK	Handsome Lee has just informed us of your upcoming show in Paris.
AUDRA CLARK	Congratulations.
JOHN PAUL SANDAL	"Yeah, right, a solo exhibit at the Galerie Nationale du Jeu de Paume."
JOHN PAUL SANDAL	Just another day.
JOHN PAUL SANDAL	You are so full of shit.
ALEKSANDR	I never said I wasn't.
AUDRA CLARK	"It's your first new exhibit in what, four years?"
ALEKSANDR	Six.
AUDRA CLARK	"Well, the world is waiting with breath that is baited."
AUDRA CLARK	We need menus and a wine list.
AUDRA CLARK	So how are they?
CARRIE	The oysters are very good.
AUDRA CLARK	"No, his pieces."
CARRIE	"Oh, um, I don't know."
CARRIE	I haven't seen them yet.
JOHN PAUL SANDAL	are You an artist as Well?
CARRIE	"No, I'm a writer."
AUDRA CLARK	Novels?
CARRIE	"No, I write a column for a newspaper."
AUDRA CLARK	the Times?
CARRIE	the New York Star.
ALEKSANDR	"It's very good column about women, men and sex."
ALEKSANDR	"Very smart, and very funny."
AUDRA CLARK	I'm sure.
ALEKSANDR	"You're not sure, you're snide."
ALEKSANDR	May I borrow your newspaper?
CARRIE	"No, No, What are you... oh.."
ALEKSANDR	Let's see.
ALEKSANDR	It's my belief that the last time anyone actually enjoyed the 69 position was in 1969.
ALEKSANDR	I think it's funny.
CARRIE	That wasn't one of my smartest ones.
CARRIE	"And further Uptown, Charlotte didn't mind the cold."
CARRIE	She had a new puppy love to keep her warm.
WOMAN	"Oh, that is the most precious little thing."
CHARLOTTE	Thank you.
WOMAN	What's her name?
CHARLOTTE	Elizabeth Taylor.
WOMAN	Aw.
ANTHONY	That is the fourth person to stop and gush.
ANTHONY	"I swear that dog's getting cruised more than me, and we're on the corner of gay and gay."
CHARLOTTE	"She loves the attention, doesn't she?"
CHARLOTTE	Look how she prances along.
CHARLOTTE	do You see her prancing?
ANTHONY	"Yes, she's very prancy."
CHARLOTTE	"She was a show dog, you know. She even competed at Westminster."
ANTHONY	Did she ever win anything?
CHARLOTTE	"Well, no, but I think that was only because her last owner wasn't very supportive."
CHARLOTTE	I think she misses the competition.
CHARLOTTE	See how she's showing off.
ANTHONY	She's freaking attention whore.
AN	Cute dog.
ANTHONY	Thank you.
CHARLOTTE	I'm thinking of re-entering her.
CHARLOTTE	"I think with my love and a little encouragement,"
CHARLOTTE	she could actually win. What do you think?
ANTHONY	"What the hell, do it."
ANTHONY	Nobody puts baby in the corner.
ANTHONY	"Dirty Dancing, hello?"
CARRIE	"And over in Brooklyn, someone was not feeling so prancy."
STEVE	Hey.
STEVE	"Man, your face is freezing."
IRANDA	I had to walk all the way from the subway in these heels.
IRANDA	My feet are killing me.
STEVE	Why didn't you just carry and wear sneakers like everyone else?
IRANDA	Stop.
IRANDA	"You can take me out of Manhattan, but you can't take me out of my shoes."
STEVE	Then stop complaining about them.
IRANDA	You're right. I have much bigger things to complain about.
IRANDA	Did you get a chance to install my DSL line today?
STEVE	I was putting up sheet racks in Brady's room.
IRANDA	"Steve, you know I can't live without internet access."
STEVE	You want your kid to live without walls?
STEVE	Here.
STEVE	This oughtta cheer you up.
STEVE	The Pony Express finally got our address right.
IRANDA	We have mail?
IRANDA	My Tattle Tale came.
IRANDA	"Finally, a connection to the real world."
STEVE	I can't believe that you read that crap.
IRANDA	"I love it, it's my thing. Let it go."
STEVE	"Oh, Magda and Brady.."
IRANDA	"I'm reading this, you no longer exist."
CARRIE	"That night, at the only restaurant that seemed to exist."
STANFORD	"Oh, there's Samantha's boyfriend, Smith."
ARCUS	"Oh, Where?"
STANFORD	"Star table, let's say hello."
ARCUS	I'm nervous.
ARCUS	He's so unbelievably hot in that Gus Van Sant's movie.
STANFORD	But can he pull off a fuschia Oswald Boateng shirt?
STANFORD	"Hi, sorry to interrupt."
STANFORD	We've met before. We're friends of Samantha's.
SAMANTHA	I hear she's a wonderful woman.
STANFORD	"Oh my god, that's a good look for you."
ARCUS	It's very Jefferson Starship.
SAMANTHA	"Well, I decided to turn a little hair loss into a lot of hair game."
STANFORD	You're getting wiggy with it.
SMITH	Come on. Jam in here right next to me.
DAVID	"Oh, we don't wanna disturb."
SMITH	Are you kidding? Any friend of Samantha's.
STANFORD	Okay.
STANFORD	this is my Boyfriend Marcus.
STANFORD	"Marcus, Smith."
ARCUS	"Oh, What are You Drinking, It looks yummy."
FAN	Smith.
SMITH	"How you doing, boss?"
FAN	"Dude, my girl loves you."
FAN	You gotta let me get a picture.
SMITH	Only if You get my friends here.
FAN	All right.
CARRIE	I heard that Aleksandr Petrovsky is having a solo show in Paris.
ALEKSANDR	Don't believe everything you hear.
CARRIE	"It's exciting, tell me about your show."
ALEKSANDR	Why would I want to talk about my work
ALEKSANDR	when I have you in bed with me.
CARRIE	"Because I want to know about it, cuz it's important to you."
ALEKSANDR	This looks important to me.
CARRIE	"I'm serious, come on."
ALEKSANDR	So am I.
ALEKSANDR	Very serious.
CARRIE	I just wanna know more about what you do.
CARRIE	"If for no other reason, then I would like to avoid having this face at restaurant."
ALEKSANDR	I prefer keep my work and my private life separate.
ALEKSANDR	"All this art talking, it's so fucking boring."
CARRIE	It wouldn't be to me.
ALEKSANDR	Then you're an exception to the rule.
CARRIE	"Well, then..."
CARRIE	"if you're not going to tell me about National Gallery blah blah,"
CARRIE	then I need to get serious about my busy day.
ALEKSANDR	"Oh, don't go."
CARRIE	"I have many, many..."
ALEKSANDR	"Oh, schedule. You're so New York."
ALEKSANDR	"Stay here, do nothing, get in trouble."
ALEKSANDR	Be spontaneous.
CARRIE	But I'm meeting people for things.
ALEKSANDR	"It's cold out there, stay here where it's warm."
IRANDA	"Samantha, I don't know how to tell you this,"
IRANDA	but I was reading my Tattle Tale and there's a picture of Smith.
CHARLOTTE	"Miranda, what in the world are you doing reading something like that?"
IRANDA	"I love it, it's my thing. Let it go."
SAMANTHA	"Oh, Smith is always in That rag."
IRANDA	"Yeah, but this time, he's gay."
SAMANTHA	"Oh, Boys-s-s Night Out."
SAMANTHA	"Smith cozies up to Broadway dancer,"
SAMANTHA	"Marcus Adant, and unidentified older gay gentleman."
SAMANTHA	Poor Stanford.
CHARLOTTE	Smith is not gay.
IRANDA	Of course not.
CHARLOTTE	So this makes you his beard.
SAMANTHA	I'm a beard and a wig.
CHARLOTTE	You're not upset?
SAMANTHA	"Oh, please, after the big C, you don't sweat the small stuff."
SAMANTHA	"And besides, once the gay rumor starts,"
SAMANTHA	it means you're really a star.
CHARLOTTE	Hello.
CARRIE	"Hey, sweetie, it's me."
CHARLOTTE	"Carrie, where are you?"
CARRIE	"Oh, bad news, I don't think I'm gonna make it."
CHARLOTTE	You can't come? Are you okay?
CARRIE	"No, I'm fine."
CARRIE	"I'm just, you know,"
CARRIE	I'm just all the way downtown with the Russian and it's very cold out.
CHARLOTTE	She's still downtown and it's too cold.
CHARLOTTE	"Well, you know, we haven't seen you in forever and"
CHARLOTTE	"oh, I have news."
CHARLOTTE	Elizabeth Taylor is going to be in a dog show.
CHARLOTTE	my Elizabeth Taylor.
CARRIE	Oh. Congratulations.
CHARLOTTE	And Miranda wants to really talk to you.
CHARLOTTE	And Smith is gay.
IRANDA	What do you mean you're not coming?
CARRIE	Smith is gay?
IRANDA	Don't try to change the subject. I came in all the way from Brooklyn.
CARRIE	"Oh, who are you kidding."
CARRIE	You'd use any excuse to come in the city.
IRANDA	You owe me a trip to Brooklyn.
SAMANTHA	"Carrie, we're fine. Everything's fine."
SAMANTHA	Smith is not gay.
SAMANTHA	It's too cold to leave the house.
SAMANTHA	You stay downtown with your hot man.
CARRIE	Okay.
CARRIE	Ah.
CARRIE	Which is exactly what I did. For the next four days.
CARRIE	"With my column tragically overdue,"
CARRIE	I finally left the Russian's warm apartment.
CARRIE	"Oh, good god."
CARRIE	And came home to the tropics.
CARRIE	"When you've been spending all your time in your new world,"
CARRIE	it's easy to forget that there might be people trying to reach you
CARRIE	from your old world.
BIG	"Hey, kid, how's it going?"
BIG	We just put our new cabernet to bed.
BIG	Made me think of you.
BIG	Give me a call.
ANSWERING MACHINE	"Saturday, 10 p. m."
BIG	"Playing hard to get, huh?"
BIG	"Called your cell, but I think I copied the number wrong."
BIG	Unless you're a ticked off guy named Paco.
BIG	"Hey, I wanna talk to you, call me."
ANSWERING MACHINE	"Monday, 2 p. m."
BIG	"Carrie, it's me. Again."
BIG	"Listen, uh, did I do something to tick you off?"
BIG	"If I did, call me and I'll apologize. Okay?"
BIG	Ok.
ANSWERING MACHINE	"Wednesday, 8 p. m."
ANSWERING MACHINE	"Deleted, deleted, deleted."
CARRIE	I deleted Big.
IRANDA	You deleted big?
CARRIE	Yep.
IRANDA	did You call Him to Tell Him You deleted him?
CARRIE	Nope.
IRANDA	"Wow, that's new."
CARRIE	"Delete, delete, delete."
CARRIE	Three messages last week.
IRANDA	What do You think he was calling about?
CARRIE	Don't know.
CARRIE	"And for the first time, don't really care."
CARRIE	"After his last trip, I finally got it. What's the point?"
CARRIE	Things are serious with the Russian.
IRANDA	Really?
IRANDA	That's great.
CARRIE	It's just so different and so..
IRANDA	What?
CARRIE	"It's grown up. There's not a lot of fuss,"
CARRIE	"there's no confusion about how he feels about me, he tells me all the time."
CARRIE	Unlike answering machine up there in Napa.
IRANDA	Sounds Perfect.
CARRIE	Yeah.
CARRIE	There's just one thing.
IRANDA	Thank god.
IRANDA	I was beginning to feel bad about Steve and me.
IRANDA	What's the thing?
CARRIE	"Well,"
CARRIE	we don't really have anything in common but each other.
CARRIE	We're not really involved in each other's lives.
CARRIE	He never shares anything about his work.
IRANDA	I don't talk to Steve about my work.
CARRIE	And he doesn't mind?
IRANDA	I think he prefers It That way.
CARRIE	But you guys share everything else.
IRANDA	Because we're in Brooklyn. There's no one else to talk to.
IRANDA	"Besides, Carrie, every couple's different."
CARRIE	"Yeah, I guess I just had this idea about a couple sharing everything."
CARRIE	At least their passions.
IRANDA	You want passions on top of passion?
STEVE	"Hey, Carrie, welcome back."
STEVE	"You see the new walls? Nice progress, huh?"
CARRIE	I'll say. It's really coming together.
IRANDA	What's all that?
STEVE	"Oh, I stopped off and picked up some dessert for you ladies."
STEVE	"Brooklyn's finest, we have cheese cake..."
STEVE	and cannoli's.
CARRIE	What a delightful borough.
STEVE	I'll put these stuff out in the kitchen.
STEVE	I love having your friends over.
CARRIE	"I want you to meet him, my Russian."
IRANDA	Can't wait
IRANDA	"That log is really heating up the joint, uh?"
CARRIE	Good morning.
CARRIE	All night again?
ALEKSANDR	How's the work going?
CARRIE	It was clear from his silence we weren't having passions on top of passions for breakfast.
CARRIE	"Hey, what are you doing on Sunday night?"
ALEKSANDR	"I have no idea, why?"
CARRIE	"Well, I was thinking since I met some of your friends the other day,"
CARRIE	maybe you could meet some of my friends.
ALEKSANDR	Those people were my colleagues and not my friends.
ALEKSANDR	My friends are mostly in Europe.
CARRIE	"Well, my friends are here. And they're fantastic."
CARRIE	"Then on Sunday, I'll be happy to meet your fantastic friends."
CARRIE	Oh goody.
CARRIE	"And FYI, you have a friend in New York, me."
ALEKSANDR	"You're not my friend, you're my lover."
ALEKSANDR	And that is a much better thing.
ALEKSANDR	Come to bed.
CARRIE	"Oh no, no, no. I have to go home."
CARRIE	I have to write my column. I can't turn it in late again.
ALEKSANDR	Work here.
CARRIE	"I can't, my computer's at home."
ALEKSANDR	I have a computer very good for writing columns.
CARRIE	You would let me use your fancy computer.
ALEKSANDR	In exchange for one hour in bed.
CARRIE	Okay.
CARRIE	"They say that opposites attract, but they never say for how long."
CARRIE	Should the relationship-savvy person stoke the fires of passion
CARRIE	with the kindling of work and friends
CARRIE	or shold we simply be satisfied with the romance that sizzles?
CARRIE	I couldn't help but wonder.
CARRIE	"Without sharing your worlds, can even the hottest relationship stop cold?"
CARRIE	"Meanwhile, Samantha was about to hear the hottest rumor"
CARRIE	from the city's hottest rumor mail.
CARRIE	Two young PR girls.
PR GIRL	Did you see that picture of Smith online?
PR GIRL 2	I can't believe he's gay.
PR GIRL 	No one that good-looking is ever straight.
PR GIRL 2	I thought he was dating Samantha Jones.
PR GIRL 	"All this time, I thouhgt she had the hottest sex life in New York city."
PR GIRL 	Turns out she's just a fag hag.
CARRIE	And that stopped Samantha cold.
ANNOUNCER	And here comes the hound group.
SAMANTHA	Everyone's talking about me.
SAMANTHA	"In the blink of a tabloid, I went from Demi to Liza."
STANFORD	These people know who you are.
STANFORD	An unidentified older gay gentleman.
STANFORD	Marcus got three auditions off that picture.
STANFORD	I got outed.
CARRIE	"Oh, poor Stanny."
STANFORD	How can they just assume I'm gay?
IRANDA	"Ok, I've got ten bucks on Lord Reginal the Fourth down there."
IRANDA	Any takers?
CARRIE	"Oh, You are a good friend."
CARRIE	All the way from Brooklyn to see a bunch of dogs run in a circle.
IRANDA	"She came to see my baby get baptized, I came to see her baby get judged."
SAMANTHA	I almost didn't show my face. Fag hag.
SAMANTHA	There go years and years of fucking everything that walks.
IRANDA	I thought you weren't gonna sweat the small stuff.
SAMANTHA	"Look, I can't have cancer and be a fag hag."
CARRIE	"Oh, Hey, you guys want to have drinks with the Russian tomorrow night?"
SAMANTHA	Sure.
IRANDA	I'm in.
STANFORD	"Me, too."
CARRIE	"Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry. It's just the girls this time."
STANFORD	"Oh, what am I now? Your unidentified older gay friend?"
CARRIE	"You'd be in the next round, I promise."
CARRIE	"Ok, I gotta go backstage and check on the little mother."
IRANDA	"Well, take your time."
IRANDA	We still got sporting and walking and toy. Oh my.
ANTHONY	This was not the type of blow job I was hoping for today.
CHARLOTTE	"She looks so pretty. Yes, she does."
CHARLOTTE	Did you see how impressed the host committee was?
CHARLOTTE	I really think she has a chance.
ANTHONY	"You know, you think with all these faggy little dogs,"
ANTHONY	there'd be at least one horny circuit muscle gay here.
ANTHONY	"No, nothing but boxy thick naked ladies and tweety old queens."
CHARLOTTE	Shh.
ANTHONY	Char.
ANTHONY	Did you cut yourself with the scissors?
ANTHONY	There are drops of blood here.
CHARLOTTE	"Wait, it's coming from her."
ANTHONY	No. Don't tell me.
CHARLOTTE	"Oh no, she's in heat."
CARRIE	"Hey, how's it..?"
CARRIE	What's wrong?
ANTHONY	the freaking dog Just got her period.
CARRIE	Excuse me?
ANTHONY	"Oh yeah, Aunt Flo's in doggy town."
ANTHONY	show Over.
CHARLOTTE	Don't say that.
CHARLOTTE	We can still compete. I once won a junior gymnastics meet when I had mine.
ANTHONY	It's a dog.
ANTHONY	What are gonna do? Run around looking for a teeny tiny tampon?
CARRIE	"You're right, it's not funny."
CARRIE	I'm a woman. I should know better.
CARRIE	Trouble.
CARRIE	Elizabeth Taylor just got her period.
SAMANTHA	What?
CARRIE	Backstage. That time of the month.
IRANDA	I thought she looked a little bloated.
STANFORD	And she was so bitchy earlier.
ANNOUNCER	And here come the toy dogs.
ANNOUNCER	"The judges narrowed it down to the toy poodle,"
ANNOUNCER	"champion?, the shitzu, champion Yurosaki."
ANNOUNCER	"The pomeranian, champion?, and the King Charles spaniel, Elizabeth Taylor."
IRANDA	"Come on, Elizabeth Taylor."
CARRIE	Charlotte was a dog show natural.
CARRIE	Thanks to her blue blood background.
JUDGE	Let me see the move.
CARRIE	And speaking of blood.
ANNOUNCER	The judge's examining the dogs' gaits one more time
ANNOUNCER	before he makes decision.
CHARLOTTE	"Okay, Elizabeth."
JUDGE	One.
JUDGE	Two.
ANNOUNCER	"It's the King Charles spaniel followed by shitzu,"
ANNOUNCER	"the pomeranian, and the toy poodle."
ANTHONY	That's my friend.
CARRIE	"All the dogs were champions,"
CARRIE	"but to the judge, Charlotte was the best in show."
CARRIE	Period.
TOM	"Samantha Jones, I thought that was you."
SAMANTHA	"Tom, what are you doing here?"
TOM	I'm head of the press for this tacky thing.
TOM	"Listen, could I get Smith's number?"
SAMANTHA	"Tom, no. I'm fucking him."
TOM	Sure you are.
SAMANTHA	I'm a laughing stock. I have got to put a stop to this.
CARRIE	And from dog show to doggy show.
SMITH	Are you sure you wanna do this?
SAMANTHA	"It worked for Paris Hilton. I need to set the record straight, literally."
SMITH	But I don't care if people think I'm gay.
SAMANTHA	This isn't about you.
SAMANTHA	"Now, when we get going, make sure to say,"
SAMANTHA	"Samantha Jones, you are one hot piece of ass."
SAMANTHA	"I could fuck you all night long, Samantha Jones."
SMITH	How are you going to get this around?
SAMANTHA	I'm a PR pro. I know exactly whose hands to drop this into.
CARRIE	"The very next day, two PR girls got an anonymous triple X from FedEx."
CHARLOTTE	"You have to come next time, she was so happy."
HARRY	You know what would make her happy?
HARRY	Letting her off that show leash.
CHARLOTTE	"Oh no, I don't thnk so. What if she gets hurt?"
HARRY	"Come on, honey. Give her a little victory lap on her own."
CHARLOTTE	"You're right. Okay, Elizabeth. Go play."
CHARLOTTE	"Oh look, she made a little friend, isn't that sweet?"
CHARLOTTE	"Oh, oh, no. No, stop, stop that."
CHARLOTTE	"She's a blue ribbon winner, stop."
CHARLOTTE	"Stop it. Honey, go."
CHARLOTTE	"Do something, Harry."
CHARLOTTE	"Stop it. Harry, hurry."
CHARLOTTE	She's in heat. No.
HARRY	Stay away.
CHARLOTTE	get off Elizabeth Taylor.
CHARLOTTE	Watch out for the big one.
IRANDA	Elizabeth Taylor got gangbanged in the park?
SAMANTHA	"Oh god, that is so 80's."
CARRIE	There we were at Asia de Cuba waiting for my lover de Russia.
CARRIE	"Hi, where are you?"
CHARLOTTE	"Seriously, I could not believe how many dogs she was with."
CHARLOTTE	"It was disgusting, my sweet little girl."
SAMANTHA	"Well, I think she's a woman now."
CARRIE	Oh really?
CARRIE	"No, no, I understand."
CARRIE	"Ok, I will."
CARRIE	Ok.
CARRIE	"Well, he's not gonna make it."
SAMANTHA	"Ah, that's too bad."
IRANDA	Is he okay?
CARRIE	"No, he's just in the middle of something at his studio,"
CARRIE	he can't stop right now.
CHARLOTTE	I understand. If he's feeling inspired then he shouldn't stop.
CARRIE	He's getting ready for this big exhibit at some Paris museum.
CARRIE	He's been staying up nights.
CARRIE	"Oh, I'm disappointed. I wanted you guys to meet him."
SAMANTHA	Another time.
WAITER	Compliments of Mr. Petrovksy with sincere apologies.
CARRIE	"Hey, you know what, why don't we finish these off,"
CARRIE	crack this open and give him some time and go over there and say hello.
SAMANTHA	"Oh honey, you sure you want to disturb him?"
CARRIE	"Yeah, yeah, we'll just go say hi."
CARRIE	He's always telling me to be more spontaneous.
CARRIE	A couple cocktails and a bottle champagne later.
CARRIE	"Eighth floor, Lingerie."
CARRIE	"Apartment, studio."
CARRIE	He has the whole floor.
SAMANTHA	"Wait a minute, wait a minute."
SAMANTHA	Sister's got to get ready.
CARRIE	Hello?
GROUP	"Hi, hi."
ALEKSANDR	What are You doing?
ALEKSANDR	I told you I was working.
CARRIE	I'm being spontaneous.
CARRIE	"I know, but I wanted my friends to meet you."
CARRIE	"Well, Charlotte, you've met."
CARRIE	"But, this is Miranda and Samantha, a. k.a. Foxy Brown."
SAMANTHA	Hello.
CARRIE	And I wanted them to see the house.
ALEKSANDR	"When I say I'm working, I'm workling, ok?"
ALEKSANDR	"I'm sorry guys, I'm very, very busy, but please do stay."
ALEKSANDR	"Enjoy the apartment, we'll meet one day, alright? Sorry."
CARRIE	"I'm sorry, I thought.."
SAMANTHA	It's fine.
CHARLOTTE	If he's working...
CARRIE	"Oh, do you guys still want to see the apartment?"
IRANDA	"Oh, it's late. I should get back to Brooklyn before Steve thinks I've defected."
SAMANTHA	Another time. Foxy's ready to hang up her wig.
CHARLOTTE	Do you wanna come share a cab with me uptown?
CARRIE	"No, no, I'm think I'm gonna stay."
IRANDA	"oK, nighty night. - sleep tight."
CARRIE	Bye.
IRANDA	I am So glad to be home.
STEVE	You are?
IRANDA	I love you for loving my friends.
IRANDA	"And I love you for no walls and cheese cake, cannoli."
STEVE	"Well, if you love me for that stuff, what's gonna happen now?"
STEVE	I put in a DSL line.
IRANDA	Steve.
CARRIE	"And although Steve had satisfied Miranda,"
CARRIE	she still wanted more.
SMITH	"Samantha Jones, you're one hot piece of ass."
SMITH	"I'd fuck you all night long, Samantha Jones."
CARRIE	Samantha's hot tape cooled her love of gossip for good.
CARRIE	Or at least for now.
CARRIE	"And try as I might, I could not forget the Russian's icy treatment of my friends."
CARRIE	"Hey, I need to talk to you."
CARRIE	"I know that you're busy, but those were my.."
CARRIE	Is something..
CARRIE	Are you ok?
ALEKSANDR	"Yeah, I'm fine."
CARRIE	"No, you are not fine."
ALEKSANDR	Did something happen with the piece?
CARRIE	"Hey, come on, talk to me."
ALEKSANDR	What if it's not enough?
ALEKSANDR	"On these pieces, huh?"
ALEKSANDR	Six years.
CARRIE	It's going to be enough.
CARRIE	It's true I don't know anything about the piece but...
CARRIE	you are brilliant.
ALEKSANDR	The world is waiting with a breath that is baited.
CARRIE	"Ohm, she's just an uptight bitch."
CARRIE	"Well, that's better."
CARRIE	You're a little scary.
CARRIE	"So talk to me, what's the problem?"
CARRIE	"I may not understand, but I'll listen."
ALEKSANDR	"Well,"
ALEKSANDR	yesterday I looked up
ALEKSANDR	and the entire thing looked so utterly stupid
ALEKSANDR	and flat and needless and childish.
CARRIE	It's a cold hard fact.
CARRIE	"Sometimes, there's not enough time in a night for both your worlds."
CARRIE	"When you live in New York City,"
CARRIE	it can take all your energy to stay in Vogue.
CARRIE	"So when Enid Figg, my old boss at Vogue wanted to meet me for lunch,"
CARRIE	I was eager to hear what she had for me.
ENID FIGG	"Carrie, I need to ask you a favor."
CARRIE	"Apparntly, this would be about what I had for her."
ENID FIGG	"I wanted to invite you to a party that I'm throwing, a week from Saturday."
ENID FIGG	It's for an amazing couple Roma Patelle and Andre Dubiankie.
ENID FIGG	They make documentary films.
CARRIE	"Oh. Well, unless I'm doing the catering, it sounds like a fun favor."
ENID FIGG	There'll be a lot of couples from the art world and...
ENID FIGG	I thought maybe you could bring your Alexander Patrovski.
CARRIE	done. is That it?
ENID FIGG	no. I was hoping You might..
ENID FIGG	I can't believe I have to ask this.
ENID FIGG	Does he have a single friend that you could bring along for me?
CARRIE	A date?
ENID FIGG	Well the thing is it's shaping up to be mostly couples and...
ENID FIGG	I'm not a couple and there are no exciting prospects
ENID FIGG	so I thought that someone from his crowd might be right for me.
ENID FIGG	Please never mention this conversation to anyone at Conde Naste
ENID FIGG	Yes. I'll have the Dorado.
WAITER	the Dorado. this is a much larger fish.
WAITER	This fish we recommend for two people.
ENID FIGG	See? You have to be a couple just to order lunch in this town.
CARRIE	I'll have the dorado as well.
ENID FIGG	do You even like Dorado?
ENID FIGG	"Because if this is a pity Dorado, I can have crab cakes."
CARRIE	We'll have the Dorado.
WAITER	very Good.
CARRIE	The only thing is I'm not sure if Alexander is a let's set people up kind of guy.
ENID FIGG	"Carrie, I got you a job."
ENID FIGG	You get me a man.
CARRIE	"Later that evening, the couple I was in had a couple of hours"
CARRIE	to prepare a dinner party for a couple of couples.
ALEKSANDR	Do your friends enjoy red wine?
CARRIE	My friends enjoy all wine.
ALEKSANDR	"Yes, we'll have the Barolo."
CARRIE	Hey. Do you have any single male friends?
ALEKSANDR	Are you tired of me already?
CARRIE	It's for this friend of mine.
ALEKSANDR	I have a friend.
ALEKSANDR	He's a food critic.
CARRIE	Perfect.
ALEKSANDR	Is this really how one finds love?
CARRIE	No. It's just what we do to distract ourselves until the real thing comes along.
ALEKSANDR	Now. I have a question for you.
CARRIE	Oh sorry. All my friends are taken.
CARRIE	Wow. I've never said that before.
ALEKSANDR	You know I'll be in Paris for some time with my exhibition.
ALEKSANDR	I'm going next week and I'm not sure when I'll come back.
CARRIE	"Unfortunately, having a man leave me for Paris was not foreign to me."
ALEKSANDR	I'm hoping you'll come.
CARRIE	"Sure, I'll come for the opening and maybe another weekend also?"
ALEKSANDR	"No, you misunderstand."
ALEKSANDR	I'm hoping you'll come and be with me.
CARRIE	In Paris?
ALEKSANDR	Yes.
CARRIE	For who knows when we'll come back?
ALEKSANDR	Yes. I need you there.
CARRIE	But this was foreign to me.
ALEKSANDR	"Oh, the caviar."
CARRIE	"For most women, the goal of the dinner party is"
CARRIE	to have your friends feel comfortable around your boyfriend.
SAMANTHA	I think my maid is using my vibrator.
CARRIE	"Other times, you wish your friends were not quite so comfortable."
CHARLOTTE	I don't think you're suppose to say maid anymore.
CARRIE	I don't think we're supposed to say vibrator over dinner.
SAMANTHA	I'm telling you. I went into the kitchen to get it.
IRANDA	Wait. Why was it in the kitchen?
SAMANTHA	I like to mix it up.
SAMANTHA	"But yesterday, the batteries were dead."
SAMANTHA	They were new the last time I used it
SAMANTHA	and I haven't used it since Smith came back.
SMITH	"Oh baby, that's sweet."
SAMANTHA	Now maybe in the other Republics people like to share vibrators
SAMANTHA	"but this is America, land of plenty."
HARRY	I think you could have a potential lawsuit on your hands.
IRANDA	what? breaking and vibrating?
STANFORD	As long as it's not entering.
STEVE	Beautiful piano. You play?
ALEKSANDR	Yeah I do.
STEVE	You know any Billy Joel?
ALEKSANDR	I'm not familiar.
STEVE	"uptown girl, always a woman."
ARCUS	Piano man.
CHARLOTTE	Tell us about your sculpture exhibition in Paris.
ALEKSANDR	they are not Technically sculpture.
CHARLOTTE	Oh. Sorry.
CARRIE	They are large-scale light instillations integrated with video imaging.
ALEKSANDR	That's fine.
HARRY	I don't like Paris. Too much attitude.
HARRY	And what's with the toilet paper?
ALEKSANDR	Paris is the best city in the world.
STEVE	"Easy fellow, you're talking to New Yorkers here."
ALEKSANDR	New York is wonderful but there is nowhere like Paris.
ALEKSANDR	You'll see Carrie.
IRANDA	are You going? for the opening?
ALEKSANDR	Yes she's coming with me. To live.
CARRIE	"Well, we hadn't actually discussed the details but..."
CARRIE	"yes, I have been invited to go to Paris."
CARRIE	"Later, my friends wanted a tour of the apartment."
CARRIE	"A.k.a, time to ask me what the hell was going on."
CHARLOTTE	You Would Go live with him?
CARRIE	I don't know.
IRANDA	When were you planning to tell us?
CARRIE	He just sprang this on me two hours ago.
IRANDA	how long Would You go?
CHARLOTTE	where Would You live?
SAMANTHA	is There a guest room?
IRANDA	are You really thinking Of going?
CARRIE	I'm not sure. I haven't digested it yet.
CARRIE	I'm still digesting dinner.
CHARLOTTE	this is So exciting.
CARRIE	I know. My boyfriend has just asked me to go to Paris with him.
CARRIE	This is the most romantic thing that has ever happened to me.
SAMANTHA	What do you think they're doing down there?
IRANDA	"Not having a Billy Joel sing-a-long, that's for sure."
STANFORD	"Ladies, time's up."
STANFORD	I can't pretend to be one of the boys any longer.
CARRIE	So. I spoke to my girlfriends and they have a few questions about Paris.
ALEKSANDR	But you are the one who's going.
CARRIE	Well we don't know about that yet.
CARRIE	I mean...
CARRIE	how could this work? Would I get my own place?
ALEKSANDR	Why do You get your own place?
CARRIE	I don't know.
CARRIE	I've never done this before.
ALEKSANDR	You'll live with me. I have a beautiful apartment on the Left Bank.
ALEKSANDR	But it's being remodeled.
ALEKSANDR	So we would stay at the Plaza Athenee
CARRIE	Okay but are we talking a year? Indefinitely?
CARRIE	Don't I need to learn French? Would I be able to work there?
CARRIE	What about my cell phone? Would it work there?
ALEKSANDR	So many questions. Which is yours?
CARRIE	I can't remember. I think I drank too much Barolo at dinner.
CARRIE	Okay. Here's one of mine.
CARRIE	What about my apartment here? Would I sublet it?
ALEKSANDR	I Would pay for your apartment.
CARRIE	That's crazy. I can't let you do that.
ALEKSANDR	Why? I have plenty of money.
ALEKSANDR	But I don't have plenty of Carrie Bradshaws.
CARRIE	And I've always wanted to learn French and drink wine before noon so basically
CARRIE	it's my fantasy complete with Parisian parties and museum openings.
IRANDA	But for how long?
CARRIE	As long as it's fun.
CARRIE	Indefinitely.
IRANDA	So you'd be moving there?
CARRIE	No. Cause I'd still have my apartment here.
IRANDA	Which he'd be paying for.
SAMANTHA	he can certainly afford it.
CHARLOTTE	do You think You might get married?
CARRIE	No. That's..
CARRIE	I don't think that's the point.
CHARLOTTE	then What is he promising you?
CARRIE	the world.
IRANDA	But what about your job? Your column is all about New York.
IRANDA	You're all about New York. How would youË‡
CARRIE	I don't know.
CARRIE	How can you people still have questions? I got all of your questions answered.
CARRIE	And they were good answers by the way.
CARRIE	So this is the time when everybody should be really excited for me.
SAMANTHA	We are excited. It's fabulous
CARRIE	. No. Forget it. Forget it.
CHARLOTTE	"No, I think it's really romantic."
CARRIE	then Stop killing It with questions.
IRANDA	We just wanna make sure you think this through.
CARRIE	I am thinking it through.
CARRIE	But it's a nice offer and it would be nice
CARRIE	if my friends could be happy for me.
CARRIE	Especially when I've always been happy for them.
CHARLOTTE	"Carrie, we are happy for you."
SAMANTHA	Anyone wanna talk about cancer?
SAMANTHA	Anybody?
CARRIE	They say the unexamined life it not worth living.
CARRIE	But what if the examining becomes your life?
CARRIE	Is that living or just procrastinating?
CARRIE	And what if all those helpful lunches and late night phone calls to friends
CARRIE	have made us all girl talk and no girl action?
CARRIE	Is it time to stop questioning?
CARRIE	Certain questions should never be asked by anyone.
CARRIE	Especially a husband.
HARRY	Think someone's getting a little chunky?
CHARLOTTE	Harry.
HARRY	I'm talking about the dog.
CARRIE	Elizabeth Taylor had gained 4 pounds
CARRIE	which for a dog who used to weigh 8 pounds seemed excessive.
CHARLOTTE	Hi. Can you tell me where the diet dog food is?
CLERK	Oh I can't believe her. She's beautiful. May I?
CHARLOTTE	Yes she is beautiful. But she's getting a little fat.
CLERK	Oh. She's not fat.
CHARLOTTE	You're right. That is an ugly word. She is full figured.
CLERK	No. She's pregnant.
HARRY	Honey. I got your message. So the dog's knocked up?
CHARLOTTE	Yes. She's pregnant because everyone around me gets pregnant just not me.
HARRY	It's not like she planned it. She's a dog.
CHARLOTTE	Exactly. She's not even thinking about it and bam! On her first try.
HARRY	Well it might have been her first time but it was with at least 8 dogs.
CHARLOTTE	8 mutts. And we are gonna have to raise her whole trampy unpedigreed family.
CHARLOTTE	"Elizabeth, mommy can't look at you right now."
CARRIE	Miranda just doesn't like him.
CARRIE	this is All about Billy Joel.
SAMANTHA	It's not about Billy Joel.
SAMANTHA	It's about you.
SAMANTHA	We're not going to encourage you to cross an ocean.
SAMANTHA	We're selfish bitches. We like you in New York.
CARRIE	"Well I like me in New York, too. But I really like him."
CARRIE	"He's great, isn't he?"
SAMANTHA	Yes. a bit arrogant.
SAMANTHA	But he's got the goods to back it up.
CARRIE	and he can be really sweet.
SAMANTHA	Then he's got it all.
CARRIE	then Why Does Miranda not like him?
SAMANTHA	She doesn't not like him. She doesn't know him.
CARRIE	She didn't try to get to know him. She didn't ask him one question all night
CARRIE	and she is All about the questions.
SAMANTHA	"Well, here's a question."
SAMANTHA	Why do you care?
SAMANTHA	Have you ever heard me once ask what anybody thinks about my boyfriend?
CARRIE	I've never heard you use the term boyfriend.
SAMANTHA	My point is it doesn't matter.
SAMANTHA	Nobody knows what goes on behind closed doors.
CARRIE	You know the most annoying thing?
SAMANTHA	What's annoying?
CARRIE	Miranda has a point. What about work and everything.
CARRIE	Maybe I can't leave New York.
CARRIE	I don't know how I'd do some place else.
SAMANTHA	"Believe me, your fabulousness will translate."
SAMANTHA	And nobody says he gets to dictate the terms.
SAMANTHA	Figure out how to do it so you're comfortable.
SAMANTHA	"Maybe half the time you're there, half the time I'm there."
CARRIE	Well now you're being too supportive.
AUDIOTAPE	Voulez vous a la discotheque?
AUDIOTAPE	Voulez vous a la ???
AUDIOTAPE	voulez vous allez au restaurant?
CARRIE	Later I still had questions filling my head.
CARRIE	But at least they were in French. Voulez vous a Paris?
ALEKSANDR	are You coming?
CARRIE	Yeah I Just have to put my earrings on.
ALEKSANDR	"No, to Paris."
CARRIE	Oh. Well.
CARRIE	I haven't decided yet.
ALEKSANDR	"I'm inviting you to go to France, not to jail."
CARRIE	I Just have..
ALEKSANDR	More questions? Is it possible?
CARRIE	Things to figure out.
CARRIE	My whole life is here.
CARRIE	Could we stay in New York and then...
CARRIE	just go to Paris for few months for your show?
CARRIE	Then it wouldn't feel like we're moving.
ALEKSANDR	I need to be in Paris now.
ALEKSANDR	I've been here for three years. I'm finished with New York.
ALEKSANDR	It's time for Paris.
CARRIE	But.. I'm not finished with New York.
CARRIE	Maybe we could... do long distance for a while?
CARRIE	Going back and forth?
ALEKSANDR	It's never worked for me.
ALEKSANDR	"You know, someone meets someone, someone gets bored."
CARRIE	I don't know. Voulez-vous an ultimatum?
CARRIE	Normally a couple doesn't go from an ultimatum to a party.
CARRIE	But we were in charge of bringing something very important.
ENID	"Carrie, so glad you came."
CARRIE	"Enid, this is."
ENID	Alexander Patrovski. I'm thrilled.
ALEKSANDR	Pleasure to meet you.
CARRIE	and this is Martin Grable.
ARTIN GRABLE	Hi. Looks like it's gonna start snowing out there.
ARTIN GRABLE	They say it's going to be reminiscing of the '74 nor'easter.
ENID	Hello.
CARRIE	Martin is a food critic for Bon a Petite.
ENID	Fascinating.
ENID	The coat check is right around the corner.
CARRIE	He's very sweet and smart.
ENID	He's a hobbit.
LEXI FEATHERSTON	Carrie Bradshaw.
LEXI FEATHERSTON	Where the fuck have you been hiding.
CARRIE	Lexi Featherington has been one of New York's legendary party girls
CARRIE	who always ended up on page 6 because of her bar hopping and her bed hopping.
LEXI FEATHERSTON	I'm gonna go up to the roof and have a smoke. I'll be back in five.
IRANDA	He's just so pretentious.
STEVE	are You Still talking about him?
IRANDA	It's not him.
IRANDA	I've been thinking about this and it's how she is around him.
IRANDA	She's different and not in a good way.
IRANDA	She didn't laugh all night. Not once.
STEVE	"Miranda, no offense but you never think anyone's good enough for you and your friends."
ST	You didn't' think I was good enough.
IRANDA	That's not true.
STEVE	Yes it is. And it's fine. I know you come around.
IRANDA	Large scale light instillations. What the fuck is that?
STEVE	He's kind of full of himself.
IRANDA	Thank you.
STEVE	"Let's not wake the kid, huh?"
STEVE	"Miranda, if she moves, it'll be okay."
STEVE	"You'll talk, you'll visit."
IRANDA	I bet she won't go.
IRANDA	She can't leave New York. She's got too much here.
ARTIN GRABLE	"Yeah, the best raw-milk white cheddar"
ARTIN GRABLE	I ever had was from a farm and guess where?
CARRIE	"Oh, I --
"
ARTIN GRABLE	New York. We now rival England for the best cheddar in the world.
CARRIE	"An hour later, I had somehow ended up on Enid's date."
ARTIN GRABLE	"Actually, raw milk couldn't even be used in the States till recently"
ARTIN GRABLE	because it isn't pasteurized.
ARTIN GRABLE	It basically goes from the cow right to you.
CARRIE	And Enid had somehow ended up on mine. .
ENID	That's priceless
ENID	I never liked I.M. Pei either.

LEXI FEATHERSTON	O-V-E-R. Over.
LEXI FEATHERSTON	No one's fun anymore. What ever happened to fun?
LEXI FEATHERSTON	I'm so bored I could die.
CARRIE	It was the first time Lexi had ever left a party early.
CARRIE	"An hour later, the snow really started to fall."
CARRIE	The first time that winter.
CARRIE	And it didn't stop.
CARRIE	The city was silent.
CARRIE	There were no more questions.
CARRIE	Only white noise.
HEADLINE	Daily News The Party's Over
CARRIE	I want to go to Paris.
CARRIE	It was a day made for first snows.
IRANDA	look Brady. Snow angels.
CARRIE	And staying home with family.
CHARLOTTE	See that? It's called snow.
CARRIE	"Two days later, we said goodbye to our snow angel."
STANFORD	"Wait, she tripped on her Manolo?"
CARRIE	"Stannie, the girl died. It's sad. The end."
STANFORD	I'll say it's sad.
STANFORD	The scandal of the New York social scene and I missed it.
STANFORD	I need details. Last words.
CARRIE	'I'm so bored I could die.'
STANFORD	no.
CARRIE	Hey. Hi.
SAMANTHA	Hey.
SAMANTHA	This funeral is better than fashion week.
STANFORD	I know. Marcus is saving us seats next to Hugh Jackman.
STANFORD	I'll see you in there.
CHARLOTTE	I didn't know Lexi had so many friends.
CARRIE	She wasn't always so tragic.
CARRIE	Remember the 80s? She was the 'it' girl.
SAMANTHA	I thought I was the 'it' girl.
IRANDA	"Well, it's your word against a dead girl. So you win."
CARRIE	"You guys, we're suppose to be in mourning."
CARRIE	We are. It's the end of an era.
SAMANTHA	Yep. The party's officially over.
CARRIE	"Ladies, if you are single in New York, after a certain point,"
CARRIE	there is nowhere to go but down.
IRANDA	18 stories down to be exact.
CARRIE	I'm going to Paris.
CHARLOTTE	That's so exciting.
SAMANTHA	Good for you.
IRANDA	Because you're afraid of going out a window?
CARRIE	No. Because I wanna open a new one.
IRANDA	What about your job?
CARRIE	I quit.
IRANDA	what? when did you..
CARRIE	stop.
CARRIE	We are done with the question portion of the program.
CARRIE	I'm happy. I'm going.
CARRIE	Now let's go say goodbye to Lexi.
SAMANTHA	"Well, it really is the end of an era."
CARRIE	"After the funeral, a couple of friends walked a couple of blocks."
IRANDA	You Wanna get something to eat?
CARRIE	I'm not hungry but I'll go sit with you.
IRANDA	Okay. Isn't Gordan's around here?
CARRIE	It's two blocks.
IRANDA	I can't believe you quit your job.
IRANDA	Couldn't you write the column there?
CARRIE	No. They weren't really into my American girl in Paris angle.
CARRIE	"New York paper, New York girl. Got to be such a hassle so."
IRANDA	Are they gonna have someone new writing?
CARRIE	Don't know. Probably some 29 year old single girl with all new problems.
IRANDA	I think you're making a mistake.
CARRIE	"Miranda, please."
IRANDA	"Carrie, you can't quit your column. It's who you are."
CARRIE	"No, it's not who I am, it's what I do."
CARRIE	That' s my column.
CARRIE	I think I'm gonna go home.
IRANDA	What? I'm not allowed to have an opinion?
CARRIE	You have an opinion. You've had it for quite some time.
IRANDA	What are you gonna do over there without your job? Eat croissant?
CARRIE	Why can't you be happy for me?
IRANDA	I'm sorry but...
IRANDA	I don't understand why you have to move away and give up your life.
CARRIE	You moved to Brooklyn.
IRANDA	That's just Brooklyn.
CARRIE	I cannot stay in New York and be single for you.
IRANDA	what?
CARRIE	this is about you.
CARRIE	"As long as I'm here, in the same place, writing my column"
CARRIE	then Nothing has really changed.
IRANDA	"No, this is about you."
CARRIE	"No, you moved on, Charlotte's moved on. Even Samantha's moved on."
CARRIE	I can stay here and write about my life or I can go with him and live my life.
IRANDA	You mean his life.
IRANDA	"Carrie I love you, come on."
CARRIE	Just say it. You don't like him.
IRANDA	"Fine, I don't like him."
CARRIE	Then don't you go to Paris with him.
IRANDA	You're living in a fantasy.
CARRIE	Maybe I was living in a fantasy.
CARRIE	But I found a man who could make it a reality.
CARRIE	And I wasn't gonna question any of it.
CARRIE	Not even how he found a horse drawn sleigh in the middle of Manhattan.
CARRIE	Some outfits wait a lifetime to be taken somewhere special.
CARRIE	The same can be true of people.
ALEKSANDR	"Hi, it's Aleks."
ALEKSANDR	"Stop packing, they have clothes here in Paris."
ALEKSANDR	See you tomorrow. Safe flight.
IRANDA	"Hi, it's Miranda. No, this is not my fortieth please-don't-go-to-Paris call."
IRANDA	"It's been three weeks, is that funny yet."
IRANDA	"Anyway, I got us a dinner reservation. You're leaving at 9,"
IRANDA	"so we have to eat at six. Which makes us senior citizens, thank you."
IRANDA	Or should I say merci beau.. please don't go.
BIG	"Carrie, it's me."
BIG	"I'm in town. Look, I'd really like to see you, so call me."
BIG	"Same number and in case you've forgotten, it's.."
ANSWERING MACHINE	Deleted.
CARRIE	"After many more hours of packing,"
CARRIE	I was off for our version of the last supper.
BIG	"Well, if Mohammed won't come to the mountain."
BIG	"Hiya, kid."
CARRIE	Hi.
BIG	"I was in the neighborhood, saw your light on."
BIG	Can I talk to you?
CARRIE	"Well, I'm late for dinner with the girls."
BIG	It's five forty-five.
BIG	"Come on, get in, it's cold."
BIG	"Raoul, Give us a minute, Would you?"
CARRIE	"No, no, it's okay. It's cold."
BIG	"He's a tough guy. Right, Raoul?"
BIG	I'll tip like a Rockefeller.
CARRIE	I'm sorry for not returning your calls.
BIG	"Yeah, I was starting to feel like a needy chick."
BIG	Did I do something to piss you off?
CARRIE	"No, it's.. I've just been busy with other things."
BIG	"Look, I know I freaked out about us"
BIG	the last time I was here and I wanted to..
CARRIE	It's fine.
BIG	You were amazing to me and I just..
CARRIE	You were Fine.
BIG	Would you let me finish?
BIG	"And since then, I've been thinking a lot about us.."
CARRIE	"Look, you don't have to do this okay? There's really no point."
CARRIE	It's all fine.
CARRIE	Raoul's freezing and I have to go meet the girls.
BIG	Got it. How about dinner tomorrow?
BIG	Drinks?
BIG	I'm starting to feel like that chick again.
CARRIE	I won't be here tomorrow. I'm leaving for Paris tonight.
BIG	"Paris, wow."
BIG	"You're finally taking that vacation, huh?"
CARRIE	It's not a vacation.
CARRIE	I'm going there with a man that I'm in a relationship with.
CARRIE	"He's wonderful, and I'm happy."
CARRIE	"So, please don't feel bad about anything."
CARRIE	Goodbye.
BIG	"Wait, wait, wait."
BIG	What do You mean goodbye?
CARRIE	I have to go.
BIG	Carrie.
BIG	"Carrie, stop."
BIG	What are you doing? Saying goodbye and jumping out of the car like that?
BIG	Are you moving to Paris?
BIG	When were you gonna tell me?
BIG	"What, you're not even gonna tell me who he is?"
CARRIE	His name is Aleksandr Petrovsky.
BIG	You're moving to France with a Rusky?
BIG	"Oh, come on, it's a joke, Carrie."
CARRIE	You do this every time.
BIG	"Every time. What do you have, some kind of radar?"
BIG	"Carrie might be happy, it's time to sweep in and shit all over it?"
BIG	What?
BIG	"No, no. Look, I came here to tell you something."
BIG	I made a mistake. You and I..
CARRIE	"You and I, nothing!"
CARRIE	You cannot do this to me again. You cannot jerk me around.
BIG	"Carrie, Listen. It is different this time."
CARRIE	"Oh, it's never different."
CARRIE	It's six years of never being different.
CARRIE	"But this is it, I am done. Don't call me, ever again."
CARRIE	"Forget you know my number. In fact, forget you know my name."
CARRIE	"And you can drive down this street all you want,"
CARRIE	because I don't live here anymore.
CARRIE	"Sure, now that I'm with someone else, now that I'm leaving, it's different."
CARRIE	You know who he is?
GROUP	Who?
CARRIE	The boy who cried love. That's who.
CARRIE	"And just like in the fable, it's too little too late."
CHARLOTTE	"Love, he said he loved you?"
CARRIE	"No, it's a.. No, it's an allegory.."
CARRIE	"Look, my point is, he's been doing this for years. Years."
CARRIE	And I'm done with it.
IRANDA	then Just put It All behind you.
CARRIE	"Oh, it is behind me."
CARRIE	I'm mostly upset about him ruining my last night in New York.
CARRIE	"Well, fuck him."
CARRIE	And you know I never say that.
SAMANTHA	Would You like another cocktail?
CARRIE	"No, no, no, I can't be drunk on the plane."
CARRIE	I wanna arrive stunning and impossibly fresh-looking.
CARRIE	Ok.
CARRIE	Ladies.
CHARLOTTE	"Stop, really. You're gonna make me cry."
IRANDA	She didn't even say anything yet.
CHARLOTTE	But I know it's coming.
CARRIE	I want to thank you all for wishing me well tonight.
CARRIE	In spite of some of your personal opinions about my leaving.
IRANDA	Me? I've never had an opinion in my life.
CHARLOTTE	"You guys, stop, please."
SAMANTHA	"Easy there, waterworks."
CARRIE	"Today, I had a thought."
CARRIE	What if I...
CARRIE	what if I had never met you?
SAMANTHA	"Let's put up, shall we?"
SAMANTHA	I'd like to show my face here again.
CARRIE	"Yes, Tears have to go."
CARRIE	"Right, someone say something not sentimental."
SAMANTHA	Chemo might have kicked me into early menopause.
IRANDA	Task accomplished.
SAMANTHA	You cannot believe the hot flashes.
SAMANTHA	I can barely keep my clothes on.
CARRIE	Really? What was your excuse before the chemo?
SAMANTHA	"Oh, I'm gonna miss you, you cunt."
CHARLOTTE	Oh...
CHARLOTTE	"wow, even cunt didn't stop her."
ANSWERING MACHINE	"Hey, it's me, leave a message."
DISPATCHER	"Manhattan towncar for Bradshaw. Car number 221, downstairs in two minutes."
SHEILA	"Ladies, I know it's getting late and we all need to get up for our pilates."
WAITRESS	More hot decaf?

SHEILA	But hang in and I know we can make this breast cancer benefit our best ever.
SHEILA	"Mona, the goody bags. Tell us."
ONA	"Thanks, Sheila."
ONA	"Ok,"
IRANDA	"first, we have the pink ribbon breast cancer cookie."
SAMANTHA	Oh Jesus.
ONA	"Well, what's wrong with the cookie?"
SAMANTHA	"For the past five years, every fucking breast cancer benefit I've been to"
SAMANTHA	has had that fucking breast cancer cookie.
SAMANTHA	"Now, I don't care about a breast cancer cookie,"
SAMANTHA	and I had breast cancer.
SHEILA	point taken.
SHEILA	And?
SAMANTHA	"Well, some of the women coming to this event are battling cancer."
SAMANTHA	They need something more inspirational or outrageous than a fucking cookie.
SAMANTHA	is It hot in here?
SHEILA	"Well, the cookies are donated,"
SHEILA	so we're having them.
SHEILA	"But you're right, we do this need something inspirational"
SHEILA	and outrageous to give to these women.
SHEILA	So I'm giving them you.
SAMANTHA	Excuse me?
SHEILA	I'd like you to make a little speech before you bring me up.
SAMANTHA	But What Would I say?
SHEILA	something inspirational.
SHEILA	Something you think they'd like to hear.
SAMANTHA	But...
SHEILA	"My husband's parents, the Liebermans are coming, so please,"
SHEILA	try not to say fuck so much.

ALEKSANDR	and she wants to kill herself.
CARRIE	Oh.
ALEKSANDR	She's a bit dramatic.
ALEKSANDR	Boyfriend troubles.

CHLOE	Papa tells me this is your first visit to Paris.

CHARLOTTE	"Oh, where is the recommendation from your friend, the judge."
HARRY	Here.
CHARLOTTE	And Carrie left hers at home so I can pick it up when I get her mail later in the week.
HARRY	It's amazing with all the unwanted children we have to do all this.
CHARLOTTE	"Well, this private adoption is a very competitive market."
HARRY	More competitive than China? We got like a year's wait on that list.
CHARLOTTE	"Honey, god is gonna send us a baby from somewhere."
CHARLOTTE	And it's just our job to file all the papers
CHARLOTTE	and to just be as aggressive as we can up to the point we're obnoxious.
ALEKSANDR	I'm sorry I'm late.
ALEKSANDR	This museum dinner turned into this big long thing
ALEKSANDR	with the exhibit sponsors and other? blah blah..
ALEKSANDR	I'm sorry.

ALEKSANDR	I did. You had the do not disturb on your phone.

SAMANTHA	"If you want to see the face of breast cancer, look around you."
SAMANTHA	"It's the woman next to you at the dry cleaners,"
SAMANTHA	"the nurse in pediatrics,"
SAMANTHA	the single mother picking her child up from school.
SAMANTHA	Are you sure the heat is off?
SAMANTHA	Fucking chemo. Where was I?
SAMANTHA	She's the woman with a knowing smile.
SAMANTHA	"A smile that says I beat cancer,"
SAMANTHA	I can take on the world.
SAMANTHA	"Tada. It's good, huh?"
SAMANTHA	What is that?
SMITH	It's kinda stiff.
SMITH	I Just thought It Would sound more like you.
SAMANTHA	It's an inspirational speech.
SMITH	"At AA, the most inspirational speakers are the ones who keep it real."
SAMANTHA	Keep it real?
SAMANTHA	"I'm speaking at a black tie benefit, not chillin' at P Diddy's crib."
SMITH	I'm saying that truth is powerful.
SAMANTHA	"Look, you may know AA, but I know PR."
SAMANTHA	"Now, if you'll excuse me, I simply must stick my head in the freezer."
CARRIE	"After a week in Paris,"
CARRIE	I decided my french was now strong enough to brave the ultimate test.
CARRIE	A day of shopping.
CARRIE	Dior
AN	"Bonjour, madame."
CARRIE	Bonjour.
AN	ca va?
CARRIE	Fine.
CARRIE	"Yeah, I'm fine."
CARRIE	"Oh, my purse."
ALEKSANDR	"Someone has been shopping, huh?"
CARRIE	"I fell. I fell in Dior, so I decided that the more I purchased,"
CARRIE	the less they think of me as the American who fell in Dior.
ALEKSANDR	They don't think like that.
CARRIE	"Well, not anymore, they don't."
CARRIE	This is the shopping equivalent of lobotomy.
ALEKSANDR	Poor baby.
CARRIE	"My purse went flying, I had to scoop everything up."
CARRIE	I came all the way from New York to squat and scoop in Dior.
CARRIE	I didn't even bother to check and see if I had all my credit cards.
ALEKSANDR	"Well, apparently you had one."
CARRIE	One that I won't be using again for many many years.
VOICE ON PHONE	"Allo, I'administration."
ALEKSANDR	"Oui, allo."
VOICE ON PHONE	"Je peux vous aider, monsieur?"
ALEKSANDR	"Paul Anterier, s'il vous plait."
VOICE ON PHONE	"Un moment, s'il vous plait."
CARRIE	"No, No, no. Oh my god."

PAUL	Oui.
CARRIE	"No, I can't have lost my Carrie necklace. No."
ALEKSANDR	was It insured?
CARRIE	"No, no, it's not like that."
CARRIE	It costs like nothing but it's priceless.
CARRIE	"I've just had it forever, so.."
PAUL	"Mais, qu'est-ce qui se passe? Il y a quelqu'un?"
ALEKSANDR	Allo?
ALEKSANDR	Desole de t'avoir faire attendre.
IRANDA	Hello.
CARRIE	is It Too early?
IRANDA	"Carrie, hi. How's it going?"
CARRIE	I'm really upset.
IRANDA	What's wrong?
CARRIE	It's nothing serious. It's just..
CARRIE	I lost my Carrie necklace and it's gone and...
CARRIE	I'll never be able to replace it
CARRIE	and I got it at that street fair when we were all together
CARRIE	and... it just makes me so sad.
IRANDA	"Sure, I understand."
CARRIE	"Well, no one in Paris seems to understand or at least they don't understand me."
IRANDA	come home.
CARRIE	"It's ridiculous, I just got here."
CARRIE	I've just only been here a week.
IRANDA	"So, aside from the necklace how's it going?"
CARRIE	"Well, it's hard."
CARRIE	It's harder than I thought. I don't speak the language and...
CARRIE	it's too cold and rainy to walk around all day.
CARRIE	"I've been to every museum, you know, like twice."
CARRIE	"I don't know, I'm just sort of lost."
IRANDA	Where's Aleks?
CARRIE	"Well, the exhibit is taking much more time than he thought,"
CARRIE	so... I'm alone a lot.
IRANDA	come home.
CARRIE	"It's ridiculous, I just got here."
IRANDA	I'm serious. You sound really upset.
CARRIE	"No, I'm just being a baby, you know. I lost my necklace and..."
CARRIE	I saw these girls having lunch and..
CARRIE	"I just,"
CARRIE	I just thought how much I missed you guys.
IRANDA	We miss you too.
CARRIE	"Oh, this is absurd. I'm in Paris,"
CARRIE	I've wanted to come here my whole life.
CARRIE	"I just have, you know, too much time to think."
IRANDA	What does that mean?
CARRIE	Can I tell you something and you won't use it against me
CARRIE	when I feel better and everything's great?
IRANDA	Yeah.
CARRIE	I keep thinking about Big.
CARRIE	About... what it would be like if I come here with Big.
CARRIE	Hello?
IRANDA	I'm still here.
CARRIE	"But that's just something I do when things aren't going perfect with any guy,"

SMITH	Sexy. Very sexy. Come here you.
SAMANTHA	"Please sir, my hair."
SMITH	Are we ever gonna talk about the fact that we haven't had sex in a long time?
SAMANTHA	You're bringing this up here?
SMITH	My therapist said not to mention it in bed.
SAMANTHA	Therapist? Since when have you been seeing a therapist?
SMITH	I just thought I should get some help to deal with all this cancer stuff.
SMITH	I'm not complaining. I just think we should talk about it.
SAMANTHA	Well. I have absolutely no sex drive. You're leaving town to do a movie.
SAMANTHA	What's the point of talking about it right now?
STYLIST	Samantha. I see two pairs of feet in there.
STYLIST	You had better not be doing it.
SAMANTHA	Oh we're not.
STYLIST	Yeah right. That'll be a first.
JULIET	I must admit I've been dying to meet you.
JULIET	I begged Aleks to organize a dinner with us.
JULIET	"But he said as soon as the exhibit opens, we'd all sit down. As soon as, as soon as."
JULIET	If I heard this phrase one more time.
JULIET	So. How's my beloved.
CARRIE	He's wonderful. A bit stressed.
JULIET	Why yes. He's very sensitive.
CARRIE	"Can I just say, I think it's lovelythat you both think so highly of one another."
JULIET	Why not? We had a wonderful marriage.
JULIET	While it lasted.
JULIET	But I believe a relationship is like a couture?
JULIET	"it doesn't fit perfectly, it's a disaster."
JULIET	And I couldn't quite get used to always coming second.
JULIET	It was not for me.
JULIET	Would you like a cigarette?
CARRIE	Yes. I would. Thank you.
JULIET	I thought you might be one of those Americans who didn't smoke.
JULIET	And I would be.. how do you say. Guilty of killing you over lunch?
JULIET	So. Chloe tells me you were a write in New York.
CARRIE	I am a writer. Until recently I had a weekly column in New York.
CARRIE	It became a book. It's even been published here.
JULIET	Brilliant. And Aleks is comfortable with that?
CARRIE	Oh god yes. He's very supportive.
JULIET	Then people change.
ALEKSANDR	It's good.
CARRIE	can You Hold this?
CARRIE	Aren't you gonna say anything about the fact that I'm smoking?
ALEKSANDR	Everybody smokes in Paris.
ALEKSANDR	Someone got a great review.
CARRIE	Your review's out already?

CARRIE	Is this going to be everyday?
ALEKSANDR	Carrie. I'm under so much pressure. Don't make me feel worse than I do.
CARRIE	I'm not trying to make you feel worse.
CARRIE	I said nothing when you left me alone with your wife.
ALEKSANDR	I know it's inconvenient for you right now.
ALEKSANDR	But I promise.
